There was once a king, called King O'Toole, who was a fine old king in the old ancient times, long ago. It was him that owned the Churches in the early days. "Surely," said I, "the Churches were not in King O'Toole's time?" "Oh, by no means, your honor--truth, it's yourself that's right enough there. But you know the place is called 'The Churches' because they were built after by St. Kavin, and went by the name of the Churches ever more. Therefore, of course, the place bein' so called, I say that the King owned the Churches--and why not, sir, seein' it was his birthright, time out o' mind, beyond the flood? Well, the King (you see) was the right sort--he was the real boy, and loved sport as he loved his life, and huntin' in particular. From the risin' o' the sun up he got, and away he went over the mountains beyond after the deer: and the fine times them were. The deer was as plenty thin, aye truth, far more plentiful than the sheep is now. That's the way it was with the King, from the crow o' the cock to the song o' the redbreast." Well, it was all mighty good as long as the King had his health. But, you see, in coorse o' time, the King grew old, by reason he was stiff in his limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart failed him. He was lost entirely for want o' diversions, because he couldn't go a huntin' no longer. By dad, the poor King was obliged at last for to get a goose to distract him. You see, the goose used for to swim across the lake, and go down divin' for trout (and not finer trout in all Ireland than the same trout) and catch fish on a Friday for the King. If flew every other day round about the lake disctracting the poor King that you'd think he'd break his sides laughin' at the frolicksome tricks of his goose. So, in course o' time, the goose was the greatest pet in the country, and the biggest rogue, and distracted the King to no end. The poor King was as happy as the day was long. So that's the way it was. All went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken in years, as well as the King, and grew stiff in the limbs, like her master, and couldn't distract him no longer. Then it was that the poor King was lost completely, and didn't know what in the wide world to do. He was gone out of all distractions because the goose was no more in the flower of her blume. Well, the King was nigh broken-hearted and melancholy entirely, and was walkin' one mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate, an' thinkin' o' drownin' himself, that could get no diversion in life, when all of a sudden, turnin' round the corner beyond, who should he meet but a mighty decent young man comin' up to him. 'God save you,' says the King (for the King was a civil-spoken gentleman, by all accounts), 'God save you,' says he to the young man. 'God save you kindly,' says the young man to him back again. 'God save you, King O'Toole.' 'True for you,' says the King, 'I am King O'Toole,' says he. 'Prince and plennypennytinchery o' these parts,' says he. 'But how came you to know that?' says he. 'Oh, never mind,' says Saint Kavin (for 'twas he that was in it). 'And now, may I make bold to ask, how is your goose, King O'Toole?' says he. 'Blur-an-agers, how came you to know about my goose?' says the King. 'Oh, no mather. I was given to understand it,' says Saint Kavin. 'Oh, that's a folly to talk,' says the King, 'because myself and my goose is private friends,' says he, 'and no one could tell you,' says he, 'barrin' the fairies.' 'Oh, then, it wasn't the fairies,' says Saint Kavin. 'For I'd have you know,' says he, 'that I don't keep the likes o' such company.' 'You might do worse, then, my gay fellow,' says the King. 'For it's they could show you a crock o' money as easy as kiss hand. And that's not to be sneezed at,' says the King, 'by a poor man,' says he. 'Maybe I've a better way of making money myself,' says the saint. 'By gor,' says the King, 'barrin' you're a coiner,' says he, 'that's impossible!' 'I'd scorn to be the like, my lord!' says Saint Kavin, mighty high, 'I'd scorn to be the like,' says he. 'Then, what are you?' says the King, 'that makes money so easy, by your own account.' 'I'm an honest man,' says Saint Kavin. 'Well, honest man,' says the King, 'and how is it you make your money so easy?' 'By makin' old things as good as new,' says Saint Kavin. 'Is it a tinker you are?' says the King. 'No,' says the saint; 'I'm no tinker by trade, King O'Toole. I've a better thrade than a tinker,' says he. 'What would you say,' says he, 'if I made your old goose as good as new?' 'My dear, at the word o' making his goose as good as new, you'd think the poor old King's eyes was ready to jump out of his head.' 'And,' says he--'truth, then, I'd give you more money nor you could count,' says he, 'if you did the like, and I'd be beholden to you in the bargain.' 'I scorn your dirty money,' says Saint Kavin. 'Faith, then, I'm thinkin' a trifle o' change would do you no harm,' says the King, lookin' up sly at the old hat that Saint Kavin had on him. 'I have a vow agin it,' says the saint. 'I am book sworn,' says he, 'never to have gold, silver, or brass in my company.' 'Barrin' the trifle you can't help,' says the King, mighty cute, and looking him straight in the face. 'You just hot it,' says Saint Kavin. 'But though I can't take money,' says he, 'I could take a few acres o' land, if you'd give them to me.' 'With all the veins o' my heart,' says the King, 'if you can do what you say.' 'Try me!' says Saint Kavin. 'Call down your goose here,' says he, 'and I'll see what I can do for her.' With that the King whistled, and down came the poor goose, all as one as a hound, waddlin' up to the poor old cripple, her master, and as like him as two pays. The minute the saint set his eyes on the goose, 'I'll do the job for you,' says he, 'King O'Toole!' 'By Jaminee,' says King O'Toole, 'if you do, but I'll say you're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes.' 'Oh, by dad,' says Saint Kavin, 'you must say more nor that--my horn's not so soft all out,' says he, 'as to repair your old goose for nothin'. 'What'll you give me if I do the job for you?--that's the chat,' says Saint Kavin. 'I'll give you whatever you ask,' says the King. 'isn't that fair?' 'Devil a fairer,' says the saint. 'That's the way to do business. Now,' says he, 'this is the bargain I'll make with you, King O'Toole: will you give me all the ground the goose flies over, the first offer, after I make her as good as new?' 'I will,' says the King. 'You won't go back o' your word?' says Saint Kavin. 'Honor bright!' says King O'Toole, holdin' out his fist. 'Honor bright,' says Saint Kavin back again, 'it's a bargain,' says he. 'Come here!' says he to the poor old goose--'come here, you unfortunate old cripple,' says he, 'and it's I that'll make you the sportin' bird.' 'With that, my dear, he took up the goose by the two wings--criss o' my cross an you,' says he, markin' her to grace with the blessed sign at the same minute. And throwin' her up in the air, 'whew!' says he, just givin' her a blast to help her. With that, my jewel, she took to her heels, flyin' like one o' the eagles themselves, and cuttin' as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain. Away she went down there, right in front of you, along the side o' the cliff, and flew over Saint Kavin's bed (that is, where Saint Kavin's bed is now, but was not then, by reason as it wasn't made, but was contrived after by Saint Kavin himself, that the women might leave him alone). And on with her under Lugduff, and round the end of the lake there, far beyond where you see the waterfall. And on with her then right over the lead mines o' Luganure (that is, where the lead mines is now, but was not then, by reason they weren't discovered, but was all gold in Saint Kavin's time). Well, over the end o' Luganure she flew, stout and studdy, and round the other end of the little lake, by the Churches (that is, of course, where the Churches is now, but was not then, by reason they were not built, but afterwards by Saint Kavin), and over the big hill here over your head, where you see the big cliff--(and that cliff in the mountain was made by Finn Ma Cool, where he cut it across with a big sword that he got made a purpose by a blacksmith out o' Rathdrum, a cousin of his own, for to fight a giant that dared him an' the Curragh o' Kildare. He tried the sword first an the mountain, and cut it down into a gap, as is plain to this day. Faith, sure enough, it's the same sauce he served the giant, soon and sudden, and chopped him in two like a potato, for the glory of his soul and old Ireland)--well, down she flew over the cliff, and flutterin' over the wood there at Poulanass. 'Well--as I said--afther flutterin' over the wood a little bit, to plaze herself, the goose flew down, and bit at the foot o' the King, as fresh as a daisy, after flyin' round his dominions, just as if she hadn't flew three perch.' 'Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the King standin' with his mouth open, lookin' at his poor old goose flyin' as light as a lark, and better nor ever she was. When she let at his foot he patted her an the head, and ma vourneen,' says he, 'but you are the darling o' the world.' 'And what do you say to me,' says Saint Kavin, 'for makin' her the like?' 'By gor,' says the King, "I say nothin' about the art o' men, barrin' the bees." 'And do you say no more nor that?' says Saint Kavin. 'And that I'm beholden to you,' says the King. 'But will you give me all the ground the goose flew over?' says Saint Kavin. 'I will,' says King O'Toole, 'and you're welcome to it,' says he, 'though it's the last acre I have to give.' 'But you'll keep your word true?' says the saint. 'As true as the sun,' says the King. 'It's well for you,' says Saint Kavin, mighty sharp--'it's well for you, King O'Toole, that you said that word,' says he. 'For if you didn't say that word, the devil recieve the bit o' your goose id ever fly again,' says Saint Kavin. 'Oh, you needn't laugh,' said old Joe, 'for it's truth I'm telling you.' Well, when the King was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was pleased with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the King. "Well, my dear, that's the way that the place came, all at once, into the hands of Saint Kavin. The goose flew round every individual acre o' King O'Toole's property, you see, bein' let into the secret by Saint Kavin, who was mighty cute. So, when he done the old King out of his property for the glory of God, he was pleased with him. He and the King was the best o' friends ever more after (for the poor old King was doatin' , you see), and the King had his goose as good as new to distract him as long as he lived. The saint supported him after he came into his property, as I told you, until the day of his death--and that was soon afther. The poor goose thought he was catchin' a trout one Friday. But, my jewel, it was a mistake he made--and instead of a throut, it was a thievin' horse-eel! and, by gor, instead of the goose killin' a trout for the King's supper--by dad, the eel killed the King's goose--and small blame to him. But he didn't ate her, because he doesn't eat what Saint Kavin laid his blessed hands on."
