0,"On a certain afternoon the sun was falling in the West, and in the midst of the ruddy silence a solitary lodge stood on the banks of a remote lake. ",0,148
1,"One sound only broke, in the least degree, the forest stillness. ",148,213
2,"The low breathing of the dying inmate, who was the head of a poor family. ",213,287
3,His wife and children surrounded the buffalo robe on which he lay. ,287,354
4,"Of the children, two were almost grown up--a daughter and a son. ",354,419
5,"The other was a boy, and a mere child in years. ",419,467
6,All the skill of the household in their simple medicines was exhausted. ,467,539
7,"They stood looking on or moved about the lodge with whispered steps, awaiting the departure of the spirit. ",539,646
8,"As one of the last acts of kindness, the skin door of the lodge had been thrown back to admit the fresh air of the evening. ",646,770
9,"The poor man felt a momentary return of strength, and raising himself a little, he addressed his family. ",770,875
10,"""I leave you,"" he said, ""in a world of care, in which it has required all my strength and skill to supply you food, and to protect you from the storms and cold of a harsh climate."" ",875,1056
11,"He cast his eyes upon his wife, and continued: ""For you, my partner in life, I have less sorrow, because I am persuaded you will not remain long behind me. ",1056,1212
12,"But you, my children! ",1212,1234
13,"My poor and forsaken children, who have just begun the career of life, who will shelter you from calamity? ",1234,1341
14,Listen to my words. ,1341,1361
15,"Unkindness, ingratitude, and every wickedness, are in the scene before you. ",1361,1437
16,It was for this that years ago I withdrew from my kindred and my tribe to spend my days in this lonely spot. ,1437,1546
17,"I have contented myself with the company of your mother and yourselves, during seasons of very frequent scarcity and want. ",1546,1669
18,"Your kindred, feasting in plenty, have caused the forests to echo with the shouts of successful war. ",1669,1770
19,I gave up these things for the enjoyment of peace. ,1770,1821
20,I wished to hide you away from the bad examples which would have spoiled your innocence. ,1821,1910
21,"I have seen you, thus far, grow up in purity of heart. ",1910,1965
22,"If we have sometimes suffered bodily want, we have escaped pain of mind. ",1965,2038
23,We have not been compelled to look on or to take a part with the red hand in scenes of rioting and bloodshed. ,2038,2148
24,My path now stops. ,2148,2167
25,I have arrived at the brink of the world. ,2167,2209
26,"I will shut my eyes in peace if you, my children, will promise me to cherish each other. ",2209,2298
27,Let not your mother suffer during the few days that are left to her. ,2298,2367
28,"I charge you, on no account, to forsake your younger brother. ",2367,2429
29,"Of him I give you both my dying command to have a tender care."" ",2429,2493
30,"He spoke no more, and as the sun fell out of view the light had gone from his face. ",2493,2577
31,"The family stood still, as if they expected to hear something further. ",2577,2648
32,"But when they came to his side and called him by name, his spirit did not answer. ",2648,2730
33,It was in another world. ,2730,2755
34,"The mother and daughter lamented aloud, but the elder son clothed himself in silence, as though it had been a mantle. ",2755,2873
35,He took his course as though nothing had occurred. ,2873,2924
36,"He exerted himself to supply, with his bow and net, the wants of the little household, but he never made mention of his father. ",2924,3052
37,"Five moons had filled and waned, and the sixth was near its full, when the mother also died. ",3052,3145
38,In her last moments she pressed the fulfillment of their father's wish. ,3145,3217
39,"The winter passed, and the spring, sparkling in the clear northern air, cheered the spirits of the lonely little people in the lodge. ",3217,3351
40,"The girl, being the eldest, directed her brothers. ",3351,3402
41,"She seemed to feel a tender and sisterly affection for the youngest, who was slight in frame and of a delicate temper. ",3402,3521
42,"The other boy soon began to break forth with restless speeches, which showed that his spirit was not at ease. ",3521,3631
43,"One day he addressed his sister as follows: ""My sister, are we always to live as if there were no other human beings in the world? ",3631,3762
44,Must I deprive myself of the pleasure of mingling with my own kind? ,3762,3830
45,I have determined this question for myself. ,3830,3874
46,"I shall seek the villages of men, and you can not prevent me."" ",3874,3937
47,"The sister replied: ""I do not say no, my brother, to what you desire. ",3937,4007
48,"We are not forbidden the society of our fellow-mortals, but we are told to cherish each other, and to do nothing that shall not be agreeable to all our little household. ",4007,4177
49,"Neither pleasure nor pain ought, therefore, to separate us, especially from our younger brother, who, being but a child, and weakly withal, is entitled to a double share of our affection. ",4177,4365
50,"If we follow our separate fancies, it will surely make us neglect him, whom we are bound by vows, both to our father and mother, to support."" ",4365,4507
51,"The young man received this address in silence, and still took his course as though nothing out of the ordinary way had occurred. ",4507,4637
52,After awhile he seemed to recover his spirits. ,4637,4684
53,"As they lived in a large country, where there were open fields, the two brothers, at his invitation, often amused themselves in playing ball. ",4684,4826
54,"One afternoon he chose the ground near to a beautiful lake, and they played and laughed with great spirit. ",4826,4933
55,The ball was seldom allowed to touch the ground. ,4933,4982
56,"Now in this lake there happened to harbor a wicked old Manito, Mishosha by name, who looked at the brothers as they played. ",4982,5106
57,He was vastly pleased with their nimbleness and beauty. ,5106,5162
58,"He thought to himself, what shall I do to get these lads to accompany me? ",5162,5236
59,"One of them shall hit the ball sideways, and it shall fall into my canoe. ",5236,5310
60,"It so happened, and it somehow seemed as if Owasso, the elder brother, had purposely given it that direction. ",5310,5420
61,"When Owasso saw the old man, he professed to be greatly surprised. ",5420,5487
62,"As was the other, Sheem by name, in truth, for he had not noticed the old Manito before. ",5487,5576
63,"""Bring the ball to us,"" they both cried out. ",5576,5621
64,"""Come to the shore."" ",5621,5642
65,"""No,"" answered the old magician. ",5642,5675
66,"He, however, came near enough for either of them to wade out to him. ",5675,5744
67,"""Come, come,"" he said. ",5744,5767
68,"""Come and get your ball."" ",5767,5793
69,"They insisted that he should come ashore, but he sturdily declined to oblige them. ",5793,5876
70,"""Very well,"" said Owasso, ""I will go and get it."" ",5876,5926
71,And he ran into the water. ,5926,5953
72,"""Hand it to me,"" he said, when he had approached near enough to receive it. ",5953,6029
73,"""Ha!"" ",6029,6035
74,"answered the Manito, ""reach over and get it yourself."" ",6035,6090
75,"Owasso was about to grasp the ball, when the old magician suddenly seized him and pushed him into the boat. ",6090,6198
76,"""My grandfather,"" said Owasso, ""pray take my little brother also. ",6198,6264
77,Alone I can not go with you. ,6264,6293
78,"He will starve if I leave him."" ",6293,6325
79,Mishosha only laughed at him. ,6325,6355
80,"Then uttering the charmed words, ""Chemaun Poll!"" ",6355,6404
81,"and giving his canoe a slap, it glided through the water, without further help, with the swiftness of an arrow. ",6404,6516
82,"In a short time they reached the magician's lodge, which stood upon the further shore, a little distance back from the lake. ",6516,6641
83,The two daughters of Mishosha were seated within. ,6641,6691
84,"""My daughter,"" he said to his eldest, as they entered the lodge, ""I have brought you a husband."" ",6691,6788
85,The young woman smiled. ,6788,6812
86,Owasso was a comely youth to look upon. ,6812,6852
87,The magician told him to take his seat near her. ,6852,6901
88,"By this act the marriage ceremony was completed, and Owasso and the magician's daughter were man and wife. ",6901,7008
89,In the course of time they had born to them a son. ,7008,7059
90,But no sooner was Owasso in the family than the old Manito wished him out of the way. ,7059,7145
91,He went about in his own wicked fashion to compass it. ,7145,7200
92,One day he asked his son-in-law to go out a-fishing with him. ,7200,7262
93,They started without delay. ,7262,7290
94,"The magician had only to speak, and off went the canoe. ",7290,7346
95,"They reached a solitary bay in an island, a very dark, lonely, and out-of-the-way place. ",7346,7435
96,"The Manito advised Owasso to spear a large sturgeon which came alongside, and with its great glassy eye turned up, seemed to recognize the magician. ",7435,7584
97,"Owasso rose in the boat to dart his spear, and by speaking that moment to his canoe, Mishosha shot forward and hurled his son-in-law headlong into the water. ",7584,7742
98,"Leaving him to struggle for himself, he was soon out of sight. ",7742,7805
99,"Owasso, being himself gifted with limited magical powers, spoke to the fish, and bade him swim toward the lodge, while he carried him along, which he did at great speed. ",7805,7975
100,"Once he directed the sturgeon to rise near the surface of the water, so that he might, if possible, get a view of the magician. ",7975,8103
101,"The fish obeyed, and Owasso saw the wicked old Manito busy in another direction, fishing, as unconcerned as though he had not just lost a member of his family. ",8103,8263
102,"On went the fish, and on went Owasso, till they reached the shore, near the magician's lodge, in advance of him. ",8263,8376
103,"He then spoke kindly to the sturgeon, and told him he should not be angry with him for having speared him, as he was created to be meat for man. ",8376,8521
104,"The sturgeon made no reply, or if he did, it has not been reported. ",8521,8589
105,"Owasso, drawing him on shore, went up and told his wife to dress and cook it immediately. ",8589,8679
106,By the time it was prepared the magician had come in sight. ,8679,8739
107,"""Your grandfather has arrived,"" said the woman to her son. ",8739,8798
108,"""Go and see what he brings, and eat this as you go""--handing a piece of the fish. ",8798,8880
109,"The boy went, and the magician no sooner saw him with the fish in his hand, than he asked him, ""What are you eating? ",8880,8997
110,"and who brought it?"" ",8997,9018
111,"He replied, ""My father brought it."" ",9018,9054
112,"The magician began to feel uneasy, for he found that he had been outwitted. ",9054,9130
113,"He, however, put on a grave face, and entering the lodge, acted as if nothing unusual had happened. ",9130,9230
114,"Some days after this, Mishosha again requested his son-in-law to accompany him. ",9230,9310
115,"Owasso, without hesitation, said ""Yes!"" ",9310,9350
116,"They went out, and, in a rapid passage, they arrived at a solitary island, which was no more than a heap of high and craggy rocks. ",9350,9481
117,"The magician said to Owasso, ""Go on shore, my son, and pick up all the gulls' eggs you can find."" ",9481,9579
118,"The rocks were strewn with eggs, and the air resounded with the cry of the birds as they saw them gathered up by Owasso. ",9579,9700
119,The old magician took the opportunity to speak to the gulls. ,9700,9761
120,"""I have long wished,"" he said, ""to offer you something. ",9761,9817
121,"I now give you this young man for food."" ",9817,9858
122,"He then uttered the charm to his canoe, and it shot out of sight, leaving Owasso to make his peace the best way he could. ",9858,9980
123,"The gulls flew in immense numbers around him, and were ready to devour him. ",9980,10056
124,"Owasso did not lose his presence of mind, but he addressed them and said: ""Gulls, you know you were not formed to eat human flesh, nor was man made to be the prey of birds. ",10056,10229
125,Obey my words. ,10229,10244
126,"Fly close together, a sufficient number of you, and carry me on your backs to the magician's lodge."" ",10244,10345
127,"They listened attentively to what he said, and seeing nothing unreasonable in his request, they obeyed him. ",10345,10453
128,Owasso soon found himself sailing through the air swiftly homeward. ,10453,10521
129,"Meanwhile, it appears that the old magician had fallen asleep and allowed his canoe to come to a stand-still. ",10521,10631
130,"Owasso, in his flight over the lake, saw him lying on his back in the boat, taking a nap, which was quite natural, as the day was very soft and balmy. ",10631,10782
131,"As Owasso, with his convoy of birds, passed over, he let fall, directly in the face of the old magician, a capful of gulls' eggs. ",10782,10912
132,They broke and so besmeared his eyes that he could barely see. ,10912,10975
133,"He jumped up and exclaimed: ""It is always so with these thoughtless birds. ",10975,11050
134,"They never consider where they drop their eggs."" ",11050,11099
135,"Owasso had flown on and reached the lodge in safety, and, excusing himself for the liberty, he killed two or three of the gulls for the sake of their feathers to ornament his son's head. ",11099,11286
136,"When the magician arrived, soon after, his grandson came out to meet him, tossing his head about as the feathers danced and struggled with the wind. ",11286,11435
137,"""Where did you get these?"" ",11435,11462
138,"asked the Manito, ""and who brought them?"" ",11462,11504
139,"""My father brought them,"" the boy replied. ",11504,11547
140,The old magician was quite distressed in his mind that he had not destroyed his son-in-law. ,11547,11639
141,"He entered his lodge in silence, and set his wits busily at work again to contrive some plan for easing his feelings in that respect. ",11639,11773
142,"He could not help saying to himself: ""What manner of boy is this who is ever escaping from my power? ",11773,11874
143,But his guardian spirit shall not save him. ,11874,11918
144,I will entrap him to-morrow. ,11918,11947
145,"Ha, ha, ha!"" ",11947,11960
146,"He was painfully aware that he had tried two of his charms without effect, and that he had but two more left. ",11960,12070
147,"He now professed to be more friendly with his son-in-law than ever, and the very next day he said to Owasso: ""Come, my son, you must go with me to procure some young eagles. ",12070,12244
148,"We will tame them, and have them for pets about the lodge. ",12244,12303
149,"I have discovered an island where they are in great abundance."" ",12303,12367
150,They started on the trip. ,12367,12393
151,"When, after traversing an immense waste of water, they had reached the island, Mishosha led him inland until they came to the foot of a tall pine-tree, upon which the nests were to be found. ",12393,12584
152,"""Now, my son,"" said Mishosha, ""climb up this tree and bring down the birds. ",12584,12660
153,"I think you will get some fine ones up there."" ",12660,12707
154,Owasso obeyed. ,12707,12722
155,"When he had with great difficulty got near the nest, Mishosha cried out, addressing himself to the tree, and without much regard to the wishes of Owasso: ""Now stretch yourself up and be very tall."" ",12722,12920
156,"The tree, at this bidding, rose up so far that Owasso would have imperiled his neck by any attempt to get to the ground. ",12920,13041
157,"""Listen, ye eagles!"" ",13041,13062
158,continued Mishosha. ,13062,13082
159,"""You have long expected a gift from me. ",13082,13122
160,"I now present you this boy, who has had the presumption to climb up where you are to molest your young. ",13122,13226
161,"Stretch forth your claws and seize him."" ",13226,13267
162,"So saying, the old magician, according to his custom in such cases, turned his back upon Owasso. ",13267,13364
163,"Going off in his canoe at a word, he left his son-in-law to shift for himself. ",13364,13443
164,But the birds did not seem to be so badly-minded as the old magician had supposed. ,13443,13526
165,"a very old bald eagle, quite corpulent and large of limb, alighting on a branch just opposite, opened conversation with him by asking what had brought him there. ",13526,13688
166,"Owasso replied that he had not mounted the tree of himself, or out of any disposition to harm his people. ",13688,13794
167,"his father-in-law, the old magician who had just left them, had sent him up. ",13794,13871
168,He was constantly sending him on mischievous errands. ,13871,13925
169,"In a word, the young man was enlarging at great length upon the character of the wicked Manito. ",13925,14021
170,"He was interrupted by being darted upon by a hungry-eyed bird, with long claws. ",14021,14101
171,"Owasso, not in the least disconcerted, boldly seized this fierce eagle by the neck and dashed it against the rocks, crying out: ""Thus will I deal with all who come near me."" ",14101,14275
172,"The old eagle, who appeared to be the head of the tribe, was so pleased with this show of spirit that he immediately appointed two tall birds, uncommonly strong in the wings, to transport Owasso to his lodge. ",14275,14484
173,They were to take turns in conducting him through the air. ,14484,14543
174,"Owasso expressed many obligations to the old eagle for his kindness, and they forthwith set out. ",14543,14640
175,"It was a high point from which they started, for the pine-tree had shot far, far up toward the clouds, and they could even descry the enchanted island where the old magician lived, though it was miles and miles away. ",14640,14857
176,For this point they steered their flight. ,14857,14899
177,In a short time they landed Owasso at the door of the lodge. ,14899,14960
178,"With many compliments for their dispatch, Owasso dismissed the birds, and stood ready to greet his wicked father-in-law who now arrived. ",14960,15097
179,"When he espied his son-in-law still unharmed, Mishosha grew very black in the face. ",15097,15181
180,He had but a single charm left. ,15181,15213
181,He thought he would ponder deeply how he could employ that to the best advantage. ,15213,15295
182,"It happened that while he was doing so, one evening, as Owasso and his wife were sitting on the banks of the lake, and the soft breeze swept over it, they heard a song, as if sung by some one at a great distance. ",15295,15508
183,"The sound continued for some time, and then died away in perfect stillness. ",15508,15584
184,"""Oh, it is the voice of Sheem,"" cried Owasso. ",15584,15630
185,"""It is the voice of my brother! ",15630,15662
186,"If I could but only see him!"" ",15662,15692
187,And he hung down his head in deep anguish. ,15692,15735
188,"His wife witnessed his distress, and to comfort him she proposed that they should attempt to make their escape, and carry him succor on the morrow. ",15735,15883
189,"When the morning came, and the sun shone warmly into the lodge, the wife of Owasso offered to comb her father's hair, with the hope that it would soothe him to sleep. ",15883,16050
190,It had that effect. ,16050,16070
191,"They no sooner saw him in deep slumber than they seized the magic canoe, Owasso uttered the charmed words, ""Chemaun Poll!"" ",16070,16193
192,and they glided away upon the water without need of oar or sail. ,16193,16258
193,"They had nearly reached the land on the opposite side of the lake, and could distinctly hear the voice of the younger brother singing his lament as before, when the old magician wakened. ",16258,16445
194,"Missing his daughter and her husband, he suspected deception of some kind. ",16445,16520
195,He looked for his magic boat and found it gone. ,16520,16568
196,"He spoke the magic words, which were more powerful from him than from any other person in the world, and the canoe immediately returned; ",16568,16705
197, to the sore disappointment of Owasso and his wife. ,16704,16756
198,"When they came back to the shore, Mishosha stood upon the beach and drew up his canoe. ",16756,16843
199,He did not utter a word. ,16843,16868
200,The son-in-law and daughter entered the lodge in silence. ,16868,16926
201,"The time, walking along in its broad open path, brought the autumn months to a close, and the winter had set in. ",16926,17039
202,"Soon after the first fall of snow, Owasso said: ""Father, I wish to try my skill in hunting. ",17039,17131
203,"It is said there is plenty of game not far off, and it can now be easily tracked. ",17131,17213
204,"Let us go."" ",17213,17225
205,The magician consented. ,17225,17249
206,"They set out, and arriving at a good ground for their sport, they spent the day in hunting. ",17249,17341
207,"Night coming on, they built themselves a lodge of pine-branches to sleep in. ",17341,17418
208,"Although it was bitterly cold, the young man took off his leggings and moccasins, and hung them up to dry. ",17418,17525
209,"The old magician did the same, carefully hanging his own in a separate place, and they lay down to sleep. ",17525,17631
210,"Owasso, from a glance he had given, suspected that the magician had a mind to play him a trick. ",17631,17727
211,"To be ahead of him, he watched an opportunity to get up and change the moccasins and leggings, putting his own in the place of Mishosha's, and depending on the darkness of the lodge to help him through. ",17727,17930
212,"Near daylight, the old magician bestirred himself, as if to rekindle the fire. ",17930,18009
213,"He slyly reached down a pair of moccasins and leggings with a stick, and thinking they were no other than those of Owasso's, he dropped them into the flames. ",18009,18167
214,"He cast himself down, and affected to be lost in a heavy sleep. ",18167,18231
215,The leather leggings and moccasins soon drew up and were burned. ,18231,18296
216,"Instantly jumping up and rubbing his eyes, Mishosha cried out: ""Son-in-law, your moccasins are burning. ",18296,18400
217,"I know it by the smell."" ",18400,18425
218,"Owasso rose up, deliberately and unconcerned. ",18425,18471
219,"""No, my friend,"" said he, ""here are mine,"" at the same time taking them down and drawing them on. ",18471,18569
220,"""It is your moccasins that are burning."" ",18569,18610
221,Mishosha dropped his head upon his breast. ,18610,18653
222,All his tricks were played out--there was not so much as half a one left to help him out of the sorry plight he was in. ,18653,18773
223,"""I believe, my grandfather,"" added Owasso, ""that this is the moon in which fire attracts. ",18773,18863
224,"I fear you must have set your foot and leg garments too near the fire, and they have been drawn in. ",18863,18963
225,"Now let us go forth to the hunt."" ",18963,18997
226,"The old magician was compelled to follow him, and they pushed out into a great storm of snow, and hail, and wind, which had come on over night. ",18997,19141
227,"Neither the wind, the hail, nor the snow, had the slightest respect for the bare limbs of the old magician, for there was not the least virtue of magic in those parts of old Mishosha's body. ",19141,19332
228,"After a while they quite stiffened under him, his body became hard, and the hair bristled in the cold wind, so that he looked to Owasso--who turned away from him, leaving the wicked old magician alone to ponder upon his past life. ",19332,19563
229,To Owasso he looked like a tough old sycamore-tree more than a highly-gifted old magician. ,19563,19654
230,"Owasso himself reached home in safety, proof against all kinds of weather, and the magic canoe became the exclusive property of the young man and his wife. ",19654,19810
231,"During all this part of Owasso's stay at the lodge of Mishosha, his sister, whom he had left on the main land with Sheem, their younger brother, had labored with good-will to supply the lodge. ",19810,20003
232,She knew enough of the arts of the forest to provide their daily food. ,20003,20074
233,"She watched her little brother, and tended his wants, with all of a good sister's care. ",20074,20162
234,By times she began to be weary of solitude and of her charge. ,20162,20224
235,"No one came to be a witness of her constancy, or to let fall a single word in her mother-tongue. ",20224,20321
236,"She could not converse with the birds and beasts about her, and she felt, to the bottom of her heart, that she was alone. ",20321,20443
237,In these thoughts she forgot her younger brother. ,20443,20493
238,She almost wished him dead; ,20493,20521
239, for it was he alone that kept her from seeking the companionship of others. ,20520,20597
240,"One day, after collecting all the provisions she had been able to reserve from their daily use, and bringing a supply of wood to the door, she said to her little brother: ""My brother, you must not stray from the lodge. ",20597,20816
241,I am going to seek our elder brother. ,20816,20854
242,"I shall be back soon."" ",20854,20877
243,"She then set the lodge in perfect order, and, taking her bundle, she set off in search of habitations. ",20877,20980
244,"These she soon found, and in the enjoyment of the pleasures and pastimes of her new acquaintance, she began to think less and less of her little brother, Sheem. ",20980,21141
245,"She accepted proposals of marriage, and from that time she utterly forgot the abandoned boy. ",21141,21234
246,"As for poor little Sheem, he was soon brought to the pinching turn of his fate. ",21234,21314
247,"As soon as he had eaten all of the food left in the lodge, he was obliged to pick berries, and live off of such roots as he could dig with his slender hands. ",21314,21472
248,"As he wandered about in search of wherewithal to stay his hunger, he often looked up to heaven, and saw the gray clouds going up and down. ",21472,21611
249,"And then he looked about upon the wide earth, but he never saw sister nor brother returning from their long delay. ",21611,21726
250,"At last, even the roots and berries gave out. ",21726,21772
251,"They were blighted by the frost or hidden out of reach by the snow, for the mid-winter had come on, and poor little Sheem was obliged to leave the lodge and wander away in search of food. ",21772,21960
252,"Sometimes he was enforced to pass the night in the clefts of old trees or caverns, and to break his fast with the refuse meals of the savage wolves. ",21960,22109
253,"These at last became his only resource, and he grew to be so little fearful of these animals that he would sit by them while they devoured their meat, and patiently await his share. ",22109,22291
254,"After a while, the wolves took to little Sheem very kindly, and seeming to understand his outcast condition, they would always leave something for him to eat. ",22291,22450
255,"By and by they began to talk with him, and to inquire into his history. ",22450,22522
256,"When he told them that he had been forsaken by his brother and his sister, the wolves turned about to each other, lifted up their eyes to heaven, and wondered among themselves, with raised paws, that such a thing should have been. ",22522,22753
257,"In this way, Sheem lived on till the spring, and as soon as the lake was free from ice, he followed his new friends to the shore. ",22753,22883
258,"It happened on the same day, that his elder brother, Owasso, was fishing in his magic canoe, a considerable distance out upon the lake. ",22883,23019
259,He thought he heard the cries of a child upon the shore. ,23019,23076
260,He wondered how any human creature could exist on so bleak and barren a coast. ,23076,23155
261,"He listened again with all attention, and he heard the cry distinctly repeated. ",23155,23235
262,This time it was the well-known cry of his younger brother that reached his ear. ,23235,23316
263,"He knew too well the secret of his song, as he heard him chaunting mournfully: ""My brother! ",23316,23408
264,My brother! ,23396,23408
265,"Since you left me going in the canoe, a-hee-ee, I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee. ",23420,23506
266,"I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee."" ",23506,23545
267,"Owasso made for the shore, and as he approached the lament was repeated. ",23545,23618
268,"The sounds were very distinct, and the voice of wailing was very sorrowful for Owasso to listen to. ",23618,23718
269,"It touched him the more that it died away at the close, into a long-drawn howl, like that of the wolf. ",23718,23821
270,"In the sand, as he drew closer to the land, he saw the tracks as of that animal fleeing away; ",23821,23915
271, and besides these the prints of human hands. ,23914,23960
272,"But what were the pity and astonishment that smote Owasso to the heart when he espied his poor little brother--poor little forsaken Sheem--half boy and half wolf, flying along the shore. ",23960,24147
273,"Owasso immediately leaped upon the ground and strove to catch him in his arms, saying soothingly, ""My brother! ",24147,24258
274,my brother! ,15650,15662
275,"Come to me."" ",24270,24283
276,"But the poor wolf-boy avoided his grasp, crying, as he fled, ""Neesia, neesia. ",24283,24361
277,"Since you left me going in the canoe, a-he-ee, I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee. ",24361,24446
278,"I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee!"" ",24446,24485
279,and howling between these words of lament. ,24485,24528
280,"The elder brother, sore at heart, and feeling all of his brotherly affection strongly returning, with renewed anguish, cried out, ""My brother! ",24528,24671
281,my brother! ,15650,15662
282,"my brother!"" ",24683,24696
283,"But the nearer he approached to poor Sheem, the faster he fled, and the more rapidly the change went on. ",24696,24801
284,"The boy-wolf by turns singing and howling, and calling out the name, first of his brother and then of his sister, till the change was complete. ",24801,24945
285,"He leaped upon a bank, and looking back, and casting upon Owasso a glance of deep reproach and grief, he exclaimed, ""I am a wolf!"" ",24945,25076
286,and disappeared in the woods.,25076,25106
