0,"In the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad named Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper, and took delight in hearing or reading of conjurers, giants, and fairies; ",0,187
1, and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur's Round Table. ,186,272
2,"In those days there lived on St. Michael's Mount, off Cornwall, a huge giant, eighteen feet high and nine feet round; ",272,390
3, his fierce and savage looks were the terror of all who beheld him. ,389,457
4,"He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain, and used to wade over to the mainland in search of prey; ",457,570
5," when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his back, and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist, and march back to his own abode. ",569,716
6,The giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroy him. ,716,790
7,"Jack took a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, his armor, and a dark lantern, and one winter's evening he went to the mount. ",790,907
8,There he dug a pit twenty-two feet deep and twenty broad. ,907,965
9,He covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground. ,965,1030
10,"He then blew his horn so loudly that the giant awoke and came out of his den crying out: ""You saucy villain! ",1030,1139
11,"you shall pay for this I'll broil you for my breakfast!"" ",1139,1196
12,"He had just finished, when, taking one step further, he tumbled headlong into the pit, and Jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him. ",1196,1357
13,Jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the news. ,1357,1417
14,"Another giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever he should have him in his power. ",1417,1522
15,This giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood; ,1522,1589
16," and some time after the death of Cormoran Jack was passing through a wood, and being weary, sat down and went to sleep. ",1588,1709
17,"The giant, passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, where he locked him up in a large room, the floor of which was covered with the bodies, skulls and bones of men and women. ",1709,1898
18,"Soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant, to take a meal off his flesh; ",1898,2001
19, and Jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching. ,2000,2085
20,"Jack, perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage, and making a slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, and tied it to the window-bars; ",2085,2257
21, he then pulled till he had choked them. ,2256,2297
22,When they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart. ,2297,2383
23,"Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore, and went into the castle again. ",2383,2484
24,"He made a strict search through all the rooms, and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads, and almost starved to death. ",2484,2634
25,"They told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants, who had then condemned them to be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own dead husbands. ",2634,2815
26,"""Ladies,"" said Jack, ""I have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother; ",2815,2894
27," and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains, to make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt."" ",2893,3012
28,"He then very politely gave them the keys of the castle, and went further on his journey to Wales. ",3012,3110
29,"As Jack had but little money, he went on as fast as possible. ",3110,3172
30,At length he came to a handsome house. ,3172,3211
31,"Jack knocked at the door, when there came forth a Welsh giant. ",3211,3274
32,"Jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way, on which the giant made him welcome, and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in. ",3274,3425
33,"Jack took off his clothes quickly, but though he was weary he could not go to sleep. ",3425,3510
34,"Soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and forward in the next room, and saying to himself: ""Though here you lodge with me this night, You shall not see the morning light; ",3510,3695
35," My club shall dash your brains out quite."" ",3694,3738
36,"""Say you so?"" ",3738,3752
37,thought Jack. ,3752,3766
38,"""Are these your tricks upon travelers? ",3766,3805
39,"But I hope to prove as cunning as you are."" ",3805,3849
40,"Then, getting out of bed, he groped about the room, and at last found a large thick billet of wood. ",3849,3949
41,"He laid it in his own place in the bed, and then hid himself in a dark corner of the room. ",3949,4040
42,"The giant, about midnight, entered the apartment, and with his bludgeon struck many blows on the bed, in the very place where Jack had laid the log; ",4040,4189
43," and then he went back to his own room, thinking he had broken all Jack's bones. ",4188,4269
44,"Early in the morning Jack put a bold face upon the matter, and walked into the giant's room to thank him for his lodging. ",4269,4391
45,"The giant started when he saw him, and began to stammer out: ""Oh! ",4391,4457
46,dear me; ,4457,4466
47, is it you? ,4465,4477
48,Pray how did you sleep last night? ,4477,4512
49,"Did you hear or see anything in the dead of the night?"" ",4512,4568
50,"""Nothing to speak of,"" said Jack, carelessly; ",4568,4614
51," ""a rat, I believe, gave me three or four slaps with its tail, and disturbed me a little; ",4613,4703
52," but I soon went to sleep again."" ",4702,4736
53,The giant wondered more and more at this; ,4736,4778
54," yet he did not answer a word, but went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast. ",4777,4880
55,"Jack wanted to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as himself, so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat, and slip the hasty-pudding into this bag, while he seemed to put it into his mouth. ",4880,5098
56,"When breakfast was over he said to the giant: ""Now I will show you a fine trick. ",5098,5179
57,I can cure all wounds with a touch; ,5179,5215
58," I could cut off my head in one minute, and the next put it sound again on my shoulders. ",5214,5303
59,"You shall see an example."" ",5303,5330
60,"He then took hold of the knife, ripped up the leathern bag, and all the hasty-pudding tumbled out upon the floor. ",5330,5444
61,"""Ods splutter hur nails!"" ",5444,5470
62,"cried the Welsh giant, who was ashamed to be outdone by such a little fellow as Jack, ""hur can do that hurself"";",5470,5582
63," so he snatched up the knife, plunged it into his own stomach, and in a moment dropped down dead. ",5582,5680
64,"Jack, having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings, resolved not to be idle in future; ",5680,5778
65," he therefore furnished himself with a horse, a cap of knowledge, a sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and an invisible coat, the better to perform the wonderful enterprises that lay before him. ",5777,5977
66,"He traveled over high hills, and on the third day he came to a large and spacious forest through which his road lay. ",5977,6094
67,Scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady. ,6094,6236
68,"Jack alighted from his horse, and tying him to an oak tree, put on his invisible coat, under which he carried his sword of sharpness. ",6236,6370
69,"When he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him, but could not reach his body, but wounded his thighs in several places; ",6370,6503
70," and at length, putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might, he cut off both his legs. ",6502,6607
71,"Then Jack, setting his foot upon his neck, plunged his sword into the giant's body, when the monster gave a groan and expired. ",6607,6734
72,"The knight and his lady thanked Jack for their deliverance, and invited him to their house, to receive a proper reward for his services. ",6734,6871
73,"""No,"" said Jack, ""I cannot be easy till I find out this monster's habitation."" ",6871,6950
74,"So, taking the knight's directions, he mounted his horse and soon after came in sight of another giant, who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his brother's return. ",6950,7125
75,"Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on his invisible coat, approached and aimed a blow at the giant's head, but, missing his aim, he only cut off his nose. ",7125,7288
76,On this the giant seized his club and laid about him most unmercifully. ,7288,7360
77,"""Nay,"" said Jack, ""if this be the case I'd better dispatch you!"" ",7360,7425
78,"so, jumping upon the block, he stabbed him in the back, when he dropped down dead. ",7425,7508
79,"Jack then proceeded on his journey, and traveled over hills and dales, till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a lonely house, when an old man let him in. ",7508,7694
80,"When Jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him: ""My son, on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by the giant Galligantus and a vile magician. ",7694,7858
81,"I lament the fate of a duke's daughter, whom they seized as she was walking in her father's garden, and brought hither transformed into a deer."" ",7858,8003
82,"Jack promised that in the morning, at the risk of his life, he would break the enchantment; ",8003,8095
83," and after a sound sleep he rose early, put on his invisible coat, and got ready for the attempt. ",8094,8192
84,"When he had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fiery griffins, but he passed between them without the least fear of danger, for they could not see him because of his invisible coat. ",8192,8385
85,"On the castle gate he found a golden trumpet, under which were written these lines: ""Whoever can this trumpet blow Shall cause the giant's overthrow."" ",8385,8536
86,"As soon as Jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrill blast, which made the gates fly open and the very castle itself tremble. ",8536,8679
87,"The giant and the conjurer now knew that their wicked course was at an end, and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking with fear. ",8679,8813
88,"Jack, with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the giant, and the magician was then carried away by a whirlwind; ",8813,8926
89, and every knight and beautiful lady who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes. ,8925,9038
90,"The castle vanished away like smoke, and the head of the giant Galligantus was then sent to King Arthur. ",9038,9143
91,"The knights and ladies rested that night at the old man's hermitage, and next day they set out for the Court. ",9143,9253
92,"Jack then went up to the King, and gave his Majesty an account of all his fierce battles. ",9253,9343
93,"Jack's fame had now spread through the whole country, and at the King's desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage, to the joy of all his kingdom. ",9343,9497
94,"After this the King gave him a large estate, on which he and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment.(",9497,9620
