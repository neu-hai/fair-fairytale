18,And then she thought that did not look quite polite; ,958,1011
19," so she scratched out ""isn't mouse"" and changed it to ""I hope it will be fine,"" and she gave her letter to the postman. ",1010,1130

40,"Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the oven. ",2302,2449
41,"There were two ovens, one above the other; ",2449,2492
42, some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. ,2491,2568
43,Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; ,2568,2607

51,Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. ,3027,3075
52,"Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle. ",3075,3150
53,"Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. ",3150,3243
54,She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; ,3243,3307
55, the hearth-rug was a rabbit-skin. ,3306,3341
56,"She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs. ",3341,3451
57,"Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace. ",3451,3593
58,The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; ,3593,3647
59, and the dinner-plates were white and blue. ,3646,3690
60,"When Ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish, and went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter. ",3690,3829
61,"When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; ",3829,3882
62, the pie looked very comfortable. ,3881,3915
63,"Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade. ",3915,4074
64,"And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other end of the village. ",4074,4165
65,"Ribby met Duchess half-way own the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth. ",4165,4254
66,They only bowed to one another; ,4254,4286

70,"Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit. ",4453,4576
71,"Cousin Tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation-- ""A little DOG indeed! ",4576,4657

74,"The very idea!"" ",4727,4743
75,said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit. ,4743,4773
76,Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins. ,4773,4830
77,Then she went home. ,4830,4850
78,"There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door. ",4850,4956
79,"""I trust that is not that Pie: the spoons are locked up, however,"" said Ribby. ",4956,5035
80,But there was nobody there. ,5035,5063
81,"Ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty, and turned the pie. ",5063,5139
82,There began to be a pleasing smell of baked mouse! ,5139,5190
83,"Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door. ",5190,5249
84,"""It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in! ",5249,5330

87,I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top. ,5394,5440
88,I could not turn any of the other handles; ,5440,5483
89," I think that they are all shams,"" said Duchess, ""but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! ",5482,5587

91,"I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!"" ",5629,5690
92,Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; ,5690,5746
93, and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; ,5745,5823
94, and passed the time until the clock struck four. ,5822,5872
95,Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her dress. ,5872,6025
96,"She put on a lilac silk gown, for the party, and an embroidered muslin apron and tippet. ",6025,6114

100,"She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot. ",6313,6412
101,She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. ,6412,6469
102,"""I am glad I used the BOTTOM oven,"" said Ribby, ""the top one would certainly have been very much too hot. ",6469,6575

105,"Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party. ",6668,6737
