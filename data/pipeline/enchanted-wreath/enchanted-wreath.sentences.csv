0,Once upon a time there lived near a forest a man and his wife and two girls; ,0,77
1," one girl was the daughter of the man, and the other the daughter of his wife; ",76,155
2," and the man's daughter was good and beautiful, but the woman's daughter was cross and ugly. ",154,247
3,"However, her mother did not know that, but thought her the most bewitching maiden that ever was seen. ",247,349
4,One day the man called to his daughter and bade her come with him into the forest to cut wood. ,349,444
5,"They worked hard all day, but in spite of the chopping they were very cold, for it rained heavily, and when they returned home, they were wet through. ",444,595
6,"Then, to his vexation, the man found that he had left his axe behind him, and he knew that if it lay all night in the mud it would become rusty and useless. ",595,752
7,"So he said to his wife: 'I have dropped my axe in the forest, bid your daughter go and fetch it, for mine has worked hard all day and is both wet and weary.' ",752,910
8,"But the wife answered: 'If your daughter is wet already, it is all the more reason that she should go and get the axe. ",910,1029
9,"Besides, she is a great strong girl, and a little rain will not hurt her, while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold.' ",1029,1157
10,"By long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more, and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe. ",1157,1305
11,"The walk took some time, for it was very dark, and her shoes often stuck in the mud, but she was brave as well as beautiful and never thought of turning back merely because the path was both difficult and unpleasant. ",1305,1522
12,"At last, with her dress torn by brambles that she could not see, and her fact scratched by the twigs on the trees, she reached the spot where she and her father had been cutting in the morning, and found the axe in the place he had left it. ",1522,1763
13,"To her surprise, three little doves were sitting on the handle, all of them looking very sad. ",1763,1857
14,"'You poor little things,' said the girl, stroking them. ",1857,1913
15,'Why do you sit there and get wet? ,1913,1948
16,"Go and fly home to your nest, it will be much warmer than this; ",1948,2012
17," but first eat this bread, which I saved from my dinner, and perhaps you will feel happier. ",2011,2103
18,"It is my father's axe you are sitting on, and I must take it back as fast as I can, or I shall get a terrible scolding from my stepmother.' ",2103,2243
19,"She then crumbled the bread on the ground, and was pleased to see the doves flutter quite cheerfully towards it. ",2243,2356
20,"'Good-bye,' she said, picking up the axe, and went her way homewards. ",2356,2426
21,"By the time they had finished all the crumbs the doves felt must better, and were able to fly back to their nest in the top of a tree. ",2426,2561
22,"'That is a good girl,' said one; ",2561,2594
23, 'I really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came. ,2593,2656
24,I should like to do something to show how grateful I am.' ,2656,2714
25,"'Well, let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it,' cried another. ",2714,2819
26,"'And let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers,' rejoined the third. ",2819,2913
27,"'Yes, that will do beautifully,' said the first. ",2913,2962
28,"And when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head, and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen. ",2962,3092
29,"The father, who was sitting by the fire, thought that, in spite of her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely; ",3092,3228
30, but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy. ,3227,3287
31,"'How absurd to walk about on such a pouring night, dressed up like that,' she remarked crossly, and roughly pulled off the wreath as she spoke, to place it on her own daughter. ",3287,3464
32,"As she did so the roses became withered and brown, and the birds flew out of the window. ",3464,3553
33,'See what a trumpery thing it is!' ,3553,3588
34,cried the stepmother; ,3588,3610
35," 'and now take your supper and go to bed, for it is near upon midnight.' ",3609,3682
36,"But though she pretended to despise the wreath, she longed none the less for her daughter to have one like it. ",3682,3793
37,"Now it happened that the next evening the father, who had been alone in the forest, came back a second time without his axe. ",3793,3918
38,"The stepmother's heart was glad when she saw this, and she said quite mildly: 'Why, you have forgotten your axe again, you careless man! ",3918,4055
39,"But now your daughter shall stay at home, and mine shall go and bring it back';",4055,4134
40," and throwing a cloak over the girl's shoulders, she bade her hasten to the forest. ",4134,4218
41,"With a very ill grace the damsel set forth, grumbling to herself as she went; ",4218,4296
42," for though she wished for the wreath, she did not at all want the trouble of getting it. ",4295,4385
43,"By the time she reached the spot where her stepfather had been cutting the wood the girl was in a very bad temper indeed, and when she caught sight of the axe, there were the three little doves, with drooping heads and soiled, bedraggled feathers, sitting on the handle. ",4385,4656
44,"'You dirty creatures,' cried she, 'get away at once, or I will throw stones at you!' ",4656,4741
45,"And the doves spread their wings in a fright and flew up to the very top of a tree, their bodies shaking with anger. ",4741,4858
46,'What shall we do to revenge ourselves on her?' ,4858,4906
47,"asked the smallest of the doves, 'we were never treated like that before.' ",4906,4981
48,"'Never,' said the biggest dove. ",4981,5013
49,'We must find some way of paying her back in her own coin!' ,5013,5073
50,"'I know,' answered the middle dove; ",5073,5109
51," 'she shall never be able to say anything but ""dirty creatures"" to the end of her life.' ",5108,5197
52,"'Oh, how clever of you! ",5197,5221
53,"That will do beautifully,' exclaimed the other two. ",5221,5273
54,"And they flapped their wings and clucked so loud with delight, and made such a noise, that they woke up all the birds in the trees close by. ",5273,5414
55,'What in the world is the matter?' ,5414,5449
56,asked the birds sleepily. ,5449,5475
57,"'That is our secret,' said the doves. ",5475,5513
58,Meanwhile the girl had reached home crosser than ever; ,5513,5568
59, but as soon as her mother heard her lift the latch of the door she ran out to hear her adventures. ,5567,5667
60,"'Well, did you get the wreath?' ",5667,5699
61,cried she. ,5699,5710
62,'Dirty creatures!' ,5710,5729
63,answered her daughter. ,5729,5752
64,'Don't speak to me like that! ,5752,5782
65,What do you mean?' ,5782,5801
66,asked the mother again. ,5801,5825
67,'Dirty creatures!' ,5710,5729
68,"repeated the daughter, and nothing else could she say. ",5844,5899
69,"Then the woman saw that something evil had befallen her, and turned in her rage to her stepdaughter. ",5899,6000
70,"'You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; ",6000,6052
71, and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing. ,6051,6177
72,"If the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; ",6177,6361
73," and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head. ",6360,6464
74,"Things went on like this for some weeks, when, one day, as the king's son was riding through the forest, he heard some strange birds singing more sweetly than birds had ever sung before. ",6464,6651
75,"He tied his horse to a tree, and followed where the sound led him, and, to his surprise, he saw before him a beautiful girl chopping wood, with a wreath of pink rose-buds, out of which the singing came. ",6651,6854
76,"Standing in the shelter of a tree, he watched her a long while, and then, hat in hand, he went up and spoke to her. ",6854,6970
77,"'Fair maiden, who are you, and who gave you that wreath of singing roses?' ",6970,7045
78,"asked he, for the birds were so tiny that till you looked closely you never saw them. ",7045,7131
79,"'I live in a hut on the edge of the forest,' she answered, blushing, for she had never spoken to a prince before. ",7131,7245
80,"'As to the wreath, I know not how it came there, unless it may be the gift of some doves whom I fed when they were starving!' ",7245,7371
81,"The prince was delighted with this answer, which showed the goodness of the girl's heart, and besides he had fallen in love with her beauty, and would not be content till she promised to return with him to the palace, and become his bride. ",7371,7611
82,"The old king was naturally disappointed at his son's choice of a wife, as he wished him to marry a neighbouring princess; ",7611,7733
83," but as from his birth the prince had always done exactly as he like, nothing was said and a splendid wedding feast was got ready. ",7732,7863
84,"The day after her marriage the bride sent a messenger, bearing handsome presents to her father, and telling him of the good fortune which had befallen her. ",7863,8019
85,"As may be imagined, the stepmother and her daughter were so filled with envy that they grew quite ill, and had to take to their beds, and nobody would have been sorry it they had never got up again; ",8019,8218
86, but that did not happen. ,8217,8243
87,"At length, however, they began to feel better, for the mother invented a plan by which she could be revenged on the girl who had never done her any harm. ",8243,8397
88,Her plan was this. ,8397,8416
89,"In the town where she had lived before she was married there was an old witch, who had more skill in magic that any other witch she knew. ",8416,8554
90,"To this witch she would go and beg her to make her a mask with the face of her stepdaughter, and when she had the mask the rest would be easy. ",8554,8697
91,"She told her daughter what she meant to do, and although the daughter could only say 'dirty creatures,' in answer, she nodded and smiled and looked well pleased. ",8697,8859
92,Everything fell out exactly as the woman had hoped. ,8859,8911
93,"By the aid of her magic mirror the witch beheld the new princess walking in her gardens in a dress of green silk, and in a few minutes had produced a mask so like her, that very few people could have told the difference. ",8911,9132
94,"However, she counselled the woman that when her daughter first wore it-for that, of course, was what she intended her to do-she had better pretend that she had a toothache, and cover her head with a lace veil. ",9132,9342
95,"The woman thanked her and paid her well, and returned to her hut, carrying the mask under her cloak. ",9342,9443
96,"In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day. ",9443,9604
97,"This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. ",9604,9733
98,"The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. ",9733,9934
99,At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; ,9934,10037
100," and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. ",10036,10227
101,"Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head. ",10227,10393
102,"'Rest your cheek on your hand, as if you were in pain, when the prince returns,' said the mother; ",10393,10491
103," 'and be careful not to speak, whatever you do. ",10490,10538
104,I will go back to the witch and see if she cannot take off the spell laid on you by those horrible birds. ,10538,10644
105,Ah! ,10644,10648
106,why did I not think of it before!' ,10648,10683
107,"No sooner had the prince entered the palace than he hastened to the princess's apartments, where he found her lying on the sofa apparently in great pain. ",10683,10837
108,"'My dearest wife, what is the matter with you?' ",10837,10885
109,"he cried, kneeling down beside her, and trying to take her hand; ",10885,10950
110," but she snatched it away, and pointing to her cheek murmured something he could not catch. ",10949,11041
111,'What is it? ,11041,11054
112,tell me! ,11054,11063
113,Is the pain bad? ,11063,11080
114,When did it begin? ,11080,11099
115,Shall I send for your ladies to bath the place?' ,11099,11148
116,"asked the prince, pouring out these and a dozen other questions, to which the girl only shook her head. ",11148,11252
117,"'But I can't leave you like this,' he continued, starting up, 'I must summon all the court physicians to apply soothing balsams to the sore place!' ",11252,11400
118,"And as he spoke he sprang to his feet to go in search of them once came near her the trick would at once be discovered, that she forgot her mother's counsel not to speak, and forgot even the spell that had been laid upon her, and catching hold of the prince's tunic, she cried in tones of entreaty: 'Dirty creatures!' ",11400,11718
119,"The young man stopped, not able to believe his ears, but supposed that pain had made the princess cross, as it sometimes does. ",11718,11845
120,"However, he guessed somehow that she wised to be left alone, so he only said: 'Well, I dare say a little sleep will do you good, if you can manage to get it, and that you will wake up better to-morrow.' ",11845,12048
121,"Now, that night happened to be very hot and airless, and the prince, after vainly trying to rest, at length got up and went to the window. ",12048,12187
122,"Suddenly he beheld in the moonlight a form with a wreath of roses on her head rise out of the sea below him and step on to the sands, holding out her arms as she did so towards the palace. ",12187,12376
123,"'That maiden is strangely like my wife,' thought he; ",12376,12429
124, 'I must see her closer! ,12428,12453
125,And he hastened down to the water. ,12453,12488
126,"But when he got there, the princess, for she indeed it was, had disappeared completely, and he began to wonder if his eyes had deceived him.' ",12488,12630
127,"The next morning he went to the false bride's room, but her ladies told him she would neither speak nor get up, though she ate everything they set before her. ",12630,12789
128,"The prince was sorely perplexed as to what could be the matter with her, for naturally he could not guess that she was expecting her mother to return every moment, and to remove the spell the doves had laid upon her, and meanwhile was afraid to speak lest she should betray herself. ",12789,13072
129,At length he made up his mind to summon all the court physicians; ,13072,13138
130," he did not tell her what he was going to do, lest it should make her worse, but he went himself and begged the four learned leeches attached to the king's person to follow him to the princess's apartments. ",13137,13344
131,"Unfortunately, as they entered, the princess was so enraged at the sight of them that she forgot all about the doves, and shrieked out: 'Dirty creatures! ",13344,13498
132,dirty creatures!' ,13498,13516
133,"which so offended the physicians that they left the room at once, and nothing that the prince could say would prevail on them to remain. ",13516,13653
134,"He then tried to persuade his wife to send them a message that she was sorry for her rudeness, but not a word would she say. ",13653,13778
135,"Late that evening, when he had performed all the tiresome duties which fall to the lot of every prince, the young man was leaning out of his window, refreshing himself with the cool breezes that blew off the sea. ",13778,13991
136,"His thoughts went back to the scene of the morning, and he wondered if, after all, he had not made a great mistake in marrying a low-born wife, however beautiful she might be. ",13991,14167
137,"How could he have imagined that the quiet, gentle girl who had been so charming a companion to him during the first days of their marriage, could have become in a day the rude, sulky woman, who could not control her temper even to benefit herself. ",14167,14415
138,"One thing was clear, if she did not change her conduct very shortly he would have to send her away from court. ",14415,14526
139,"He was thinking these thoughts, when his eyes fell on the sea beneath him, and there, as before, was the figure that so closely resembled his wife, standing with her feet in the water, holding out her arms to him. ",14526,14740
140,'Wait for me! ,14740,14754
141,Wait for me! ,14741,14754
142,Wait for me!' ,14767,14781
143,he cried; ,6042,6052
144, not even knowing he was speaking. ,14790,14825
145,But when he reached the shore there was nothing to be seen but the shadows cast by the moonlight. ,14825,14923
146,"A state ceremonial in a city some distance off caused the prince to ride away at daybreak, and he left without seeing his wife again. ",14923,15057
147,"'Perhaps she may have come to her senses by to-morrow,' said he to himself; ",15057,15133
148," 'and, anyhow, if I am going to send her back to her father, it might be better if we did not meet in the meantime! ",15132,15248
149,"Then he put the matter from his mind, and kept his thoughts on the duty that lay before him.' ",15248,15342
150,"It was nearly midnight before he returned to the palace, but, instead of entering, he went down to the shore and hid behind a rock. ",15342,15474
151,"He had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea, and stretched out her arms towards his window. ",15474,15580
152,"In an instant the prince had seized her hand, and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water-for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her-he held her fast. ",15580,15755
153,"'You are my own wife, and I shall never let you go,' he said. ",15755,15817
154,But the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw. ,15817,15925
155,"Then the hare changed into a fish, and the fish into a bird, and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake. ",15925,16029
156,"This time the prince's hand nearly opened of itself, but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut, and drawing his sword cut off its head, when the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy. ",16029,16312
157,"The very next morning the stepmother arrived at the palace with an ointment that the old witch had given her to place upon her daughter's tongue, which would break the dove's spell, if the rightful bride had really been drowned in the sea; ",16312,16552
158," if not, then it would be useless. ",16551,16586
159,"The mother assured her that she had seen her stepdaughter sink, and that there was no fear that she would ever come up again; ",16586,16712
160," but, to make all quite safe, the old woman might bewitch the girl; ",16711,16779
161, and so she did. ,16778,16795
162,"After that the wicked stepmother travelled all through the night to get to the palace as soon as possible, and made her way straight into her daughter's room. ",16795,16954
163,'I have got it! ,16954,16970
164,I have got it!' ,16970,16986
165,"she cried triumphantly, and laid the ointment on her daughter's tongue. ",16986,17058
166,'Now what do you say?' ,17058,17081
167,she asked proudly. ,17081,17100
168,'Dirty creatures!',5710,5728
169,dirty creatures!' ,13498,13516
170,answered the daughter; ,17136,17159
171," and the mother wrung her hands and wept, as she knew that all her plans had failed. ",17158,17243
172,At this moment the prince entered with his real wife. ,17243,17297
173,"'You both deserved death,' he said, 'and if it were left to me, you should have it. ",17297,17381
174,"But the princess has begged me to spare your lives, so you will be put into a ship and carried off to a desert island, where you will stay till you die.' ",17381,17535
175,"Then the ship was made ready and the wicked woman and her daughter were placed in it, and it sailed away, and no more was heard of them. ",17535,17672
176,"But the prince and his wife lived together long and happily, and ruled their people well.",17672,17762
