0,"Long, long ago, one bright autumn day in Japan, it happened, that a pink-faced monkey and a yellow crab were playing together along the bank of a river. ",0,153
1,"As they were running about, the crab found a rice-dumpling and the monkey a persimmon-seed. ",153,245
2,"The crab picked up the rice-dumpling and showed it to the monkey, saying: ""Look what a nice thing I have found!"" ",245,358
3,"Then the monkey held up his persimmon-seed and said: ""I also have found something good! ",358,446
4,"Look!"" ",446,453
5,"Now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit, he had no use for the seed he had just found. ",453,561
6,The persimmon-seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone. ,561,617
7,"He, therefore, in his greedy nature, felt very envious of the crab's nice dumpling, and he proposed an exchange. ",617,730
8,"The crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone-like seed, and would not consent to the monkey's proposition. ",730,872
9,"Then the cunning monkey began to persuade the crab, saying: ""How unwise you are not to think of the future! ",872,980
10,"Your rice-dumpling can be eaten now, and is certainly much bigger than my seed; ",980,1060
11," but if you sow this seed in the ground it will soon grow and become a great tree in a few years, and bear an abundance of fine ripe persimmons year after year. ",1059,1220
12,If only I could show it to you then with the yellow fruit hanging on its branches! ,1220,1303
13,"Of course, if you don't believe me I shall sow it myself; ",1303,1361
14," though I am sure, later on, you will be very sorry that you did not take my advice."" ",1360,1446
15,The simple-minded crab could not resist the monkey's clever persuasion. ,1446,1518
16,"He at last gave in and consented to the monkey's proposal, and the exchange was made. ",1518,1604
17,"The greedy monkey soon gobbled up the dumpling, and with great reluctance gave up the persimmon-seed to the crab. ",1604,1718
18,"He would have liked to keep that too, but he was afraid of making the crab angry and of being pinched by his sharp scissor-like claws. ",1718,1853
19,"They then separated, the monkey going home to his forest trees and the crab to his stones along the river-side. ",1853,1965
20,As soon as the crab reached home he put the persimmon-seed in the ground as the monkey had told him. ,1965,2066
21,In the following spring the crab was delighted to see the shoot of a young tree push its way up through the ground. ,2066,2182
22,"Each year it grew bigger, till at last it blossomed one spring, and in the following autumn bore some fine large persimmons. ",2182,2307
23,"Among the broad smooth green leaves the fruit hung like golden balls, and as they ripened they mellowed to a deep orange. ",2307,2429
24,"It was the little crab's pleasure to go out day by day and sit in the sun and put out his long eyes in the same way as a snail puts out its horn, and watch the persimmons ripening to perfection. ",2429,2624
25,"""How delicious they will be to eat!"" ",2624,2661
26,he said to himself. ,2661,2681
27,"At last, one day, he knew the persimmons must be quite ripe and he wanted very much to taste one. ",2681,2779
28,"He made several attempts to climb the tree, in the vain hope of reaching one of the beautiful persimmons hanging above him; ",2779,2903
29," but he failed each time, for a crab's legs are not made for climbing trees but only for running along the ground and over stones, both of which he can do most cleverly. ",2902,3072
30,"In his dilemma he thought of his old playmate the monkey, who, he knew, could climb trees better than any one else in the world. ",3072,3201
31,"He determined to ask the monkey to help him, and set out to find him. ",3201,3271
32,"Running crab-fashion up the stony river bank, over the pathways into the shadowy forest, the crab at last found the monkey taking an afternoon nap in his favorite pine-tree, with his tail curled tight around a branch to prevent him from falling off in his dreams. ",3271,3535
33,"He was soon wide awake, however, when he heard himself called, and eagerly listening to what the crab told him. ",3535,3647
34,"When he heard that the seed which he had long ago exchanged for a rice-dumpling had grown into a tree and was now bearing good fruit, he was delighted, for he at once devised a cunning plan which would give him all the persimmons for himself. ",3647,3890
35,He consented to go with the crab to pick the fruit for him. ,3890,3950
36,"When they both reached the spot, the monkey was astonished to see what a fine tree had sprung from the seed, and with what a number of ripe persimmons the branches were loaded. ",3950,4127
37,"He quickly climbed the tree and began to pluck and eat, as fast as he could, one persimmon after another. ",4127,4233
38,"Each time he chose the best and ripest he could find, and went on eating till he could eat no more. ",4233,4333
39,"Not one would he give to the poor hungry crab waiting below, and when he had finished there was little but the hard, unripe fruit left. ",4333,4469
40,"You can imagine the feelings of the poor crab after waiting patiently, for so long as he had done, for the tree to grow and the fruit to ripen, when he saw the monkey devouring all the good persimmons. ",4469,4671
41,He was so disappointed that he ran round and round the tree calling to the monkey to remember his promise. ,4671,4778
42,"The monkey at first took no notice of the crab's complaints, but at last he picked out the hardest, greenest persimmon he could find and aimed it at the crab's head. ",4778,4944
43,The persimmon is as hard as stone when it is unripe. ,4944,4997
44,The monkey's missile struck home and the crab was sorely hurt by the blow. ,4997,5072
45,"Again and again, as fast as he could pick them, the monkey pulled off the hard persimmons and threw them at the defenseless crab till he dropped dead, covered with wounds all over his body. ",5072,5262
46,There he lay a pitiful sight at the foot of the tree he had himself planted. ,5262,5339
47,"When the wicked monkey saw that he had killed the crab he ran away from the spot as fast as he could, in fear and trembling, like a coward as he was. ",5339,5489
48,Now the crab had a son who had been playing with a friend not far from the spot where this sad work had taken place. ,5489,5606
49,"On the way home he came across his father dead, in a most dreadful condition-his head was smashed and his shell broken in several places, and around his body lay the unripe persimmons which had done their deadly work. ",5606,5824
50,At this dreadful sight the poor young crab sat down and wept. ,5824,5886
51,But when he had wept for some time he told himself that this crying would do no good; ,5886,5972
52," it was his duty to avenge his father's murder, and this he determined to do. ",5971,6049
53,He looked about for some clue which would lead him to discover the murderer. ,6049,6126
54,"Looking up at the tree he noticed that the best fruit had gone, and that all around lay bits of peel and numerous seeds strewn on the ground as well as the unripe persimmons which had evidently been thrown at his father. ",6126,6347
55,"Then he understood that the monkey was the murderer, for he now remembered that his father had once told him the story of the rice-dumpling and the persimmon-seed. ",6347,6511
56,"The young crab knew that monkeys liked persimmons above all other fruit, and he felt sure that his greed for the coveted fruit had been the cause of the old crab's death. ",6511,6682
57,Alas! ,6682,6688
58,"He at first thought of going to attack the monkey at once, for he burned with rage. ",6688,6772
59,"Second thoughts, however, told him that this was useless, for the monkey was an old and cunning animal and would be hard to overcome. ",6772,6906
60,"He must meet cunning with cunning and ask some of his friends to help him, for he knew it would be quite out of his power to kill him alone. ",6906,7047
61,"The young crab set out at once to call on the mortar, his father's old friend, and told him of all that had happened. ",7047,7165
62,He besought the mortar with tears to help him avenge his father's death. ,7165,7238
63,The mortar was very sorry when he heard the woful tale and promised at once to help the young crab punish the monkey to death. ,7238,7365
64,"He warned him that he must be very careful in what he did, for the monkey was a strong and cunning enemy. ",7365,7471
65,The mortar now sent to fetch the bee and the chestnut (also the crab's old friends) to consult them about the matter. ,7471,7589
66,In a short time the bee and the chestnut arrived. ,7589,7639
67,"When they were told all the details of the old crab's death and of the monkey's wickedness and greed, they both gladly consented to help the young crab in his revenge. ",7639,7807
68,"After talking for a long time as to the ways and means of carrying out their plans they separated, and Mr. Mortar went home with the young crab to help him bury his poor father. ",7807,7985
69,While all this was taking place the monkey was congratulating himself (as the wicked often do before their punishment comes upon them) on all he had done so neatly. ,7985,8150
70,He thought it quite a fine thing that he had robbed his friend of all his ripe persimmons and then that he had killed him. ,8150,8273
71,"Still, smile as hard as he might, he could not banish altogether the fear of the consequences should his evil deeds be discovered. ",8273,8404
72,IF he were found out (and he told himself that this could not be for he had escaped unseen) the crab's family would be sure to bear him hatred and seek to take revenge on him. ,8404,8580
73,"So he would not go out, and kept himself at home for several days. ",8580,8647
74,"He found this kind of life, however, extremely dull, accustomed as he was to the free life of the woods, and at last he said: ""No one knows that it was I who killed the crab! ",8647,8822
75,I am sure that the old thing breathed his last before I left him. ,8822,8888
76,Dead crabs have no mouths! ,8888,8915
77,Who is there to tell that I am the murderer? ,8915,8960
78,"Since no one knows, what is the use of shutting myself up and brooding over the matter? ",8960,9048
79,"What is done cannot be undone!"" ",9048,9080
80,With this he wandered out into the crab settlement and crept about as slyly as possible near the crab's house and tried to hear the neighbors' gossip round about. ,9080,9243
81,"He wanted to find out what the crabs were saying about their chief's death, for the old crab had been the chief of the tribe. ",9243,9369
82,"But he heard nothing and said to himself: ""They are all such fools that they don't know and don't care who murdered their chief!"" ",9369,9499
83,"Little did he know in his so-called ""monkey's wisdom"" that this seeming unconcern was part of the young crab's plan. ",9499,9616
84,"He purposely pretended not to know who killed his father, and also to believe that he had met his death through his own fault. ",9616,9743
85,"By this means he could the better keep secret the revenge on the monkey, which he was meditating. ",9743,9841
86,So the monkey returned home from his walk quite content. ,9841,9898
87,He told himself he had nothing now to fear. ,9898,9942
88,"One fine day, when the monkey was sitting at home, he was surprised by the appearance of a messenger from the young crab. ",9942,10064
89,"While he was wondering what this might mean, the messenger bowed before him and said: ""I have been sent by my master to inform you that his father died the other day in falling from a persimmon tree while trying to climb the tree after fruit. ",10064,10307
90,"This, being the seventh day, is the first anniversary after his death, and my master has prepared a little festival in his father's honor, and bids you come to participate in it as you were one of his best friends. ",10307,10522
91,"My master hopes you will honor his house with your kind visit."" ",10522,10586
92,"When the monkey heard these words he rejoiced in his inmost heart, for all his fears of being suspected were now at rest. ",10586,10708
93,He could not guess that a plot had just been set in motion against him. ,10708,10780
94,"He pretended to be very surprised at the news of the crab's death, and said: ""I am, indeed, very sorry to hear of your chief's death. ",10780,10914
95,We were great friends as you know. ,10914,10949
96,I remember that we once exchanged a rice-dumpling for a persimmon-seed. ,10949,11021
97,It grieves me much to think that that seed was in the end the cause of his death. ,11021,11103
98,I accept your kind invitation with many thanks. ,11103,11151
99,"I shall be delighted to do honor to my poor old friend!"" ",11151,11208
100,And he screwed some false tears from his eyes. ,11208,11255
101,"The messenger laughed inwardly and thought, ""The wicked monkey is now dropping false tears, but within a short time he shall shed real ones."" ",11255,11397
102,But aloud he thanked the monkey politely and went home. ,11397,11453
103,"When he had gone, the wicked monkey laughed aloud at what he thought was the young crab's innocence, and without the least feeling began to look forward to the feast to be held that day in honor of the dead crab, to which he had been invited. ",11453,11696
104,He changed his dress and set out solemnly to visit the young crab. ,11696,11763
105,He found all the members of the crab's family and his relatives waiting to receive and welcome him. ,11763,11863
106,As soon as the bows of meeting were over they led him to a hall. ,11863,11928
107,Here the young chief mourner came to receive him. ,11928,11978
108,"Expressions of condolence and thanks were exchanged between them, and then they all sat down to a luxurious feast and entertained the monkey as the guest of honor. ",11978,12142
109,"The feast over, he was next invited to the tea-ceremony room to drink a cup of tea. ",12142,12226
110,When the young crab had conducted the monkey to the tearoom he left him and retired. ,12226,12311
111,Time passed and still he did not return. ,12311,12352
112,At last the monkey became impatient. ,12352,12389
113,"He said to himself: ""This tea ceremony is always a very slow affair. ",12389,12458
114,I am tired of waiting so long. ,12458,12489
115,"I am very thirsty after drinking so much sake at the dinner!"" ",12489,12551
116,"He then approached the charcoal fire-place and began to pour out some hot water from the kettle boiling there, when something burst out from the ashes with a great pop and hit the monkey right in the neck. ",12551,12757
117,"It was the chestnut, one of the crab's friends, who had hidden himself in the fireplace. ",12757,12846
118,"The monkey, taken by surprise, jumped backward, and then started to run out of the room. ",12846,12935
119,"The bee, who was hiding outside the screens, now flew out and stung him on the cheek. ",12935,13021
120,"The monkey was in great pain, his neck was burned by the chestnut and his face badly stung by the bee, but he ran on screaming and chattering with rage. ",13021,13174
121,"Now the stone mortar had hidden himself with several other stones on the top of the crab's gate, and as the monkey ran underneath, the mortar and all fell down on the top of the monkey's head. ",13174,13367
122,Was it possible for the monkey to bear the weight of the mortar falling on him from the top of the gate? ,13367,13472
123,"He lay crushed and in great pain, quite unable to get up. ",13472,13530
124,"As he lay there helpless the young crab came up, and, holding his great claw scissors over the monkey, he said: ""Do you now remember that you murdered my father?"" ",13530,13693
125,"""Then you-are-my-enemy?"" ",13693,13718
126,gasped the monkey brokenly. ,13718,13746
127,"""Of course,"" said the young crab. ",13746,13780
128,"""It-was-your-father's-fault-not-mine!"" ",13780,13819
129,gasped the unrepentant monkey. ,13819,13850
130,"""Can you still lie? ",13850,13870
131,"I will soon put an end to your breath!"" ",13870,13910
132,and with that he cut off the monkey's head with his pitcher claws. ,13910,13977
133,"Thus the wicked monkey met his well-merited punishment, and the young crab avenged his father's death. ",13977,14080
134,"This is the end of the story of the monkey, the crab, and the persimmon-seed.",14080,14158
