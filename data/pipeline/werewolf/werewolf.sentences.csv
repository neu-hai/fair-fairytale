0,"Once upon a time there was a king, who reigned over a great kingdom. ",0,69
1,"He had a queen, but only a single daughter, a girl. ",69,121
2,In consequence the little girl was the apple of her parents' eyes. ,121,188
3,"They loved her above everything else in the world, and their dearest thought was the pleasure they would take in her when she was older. ",188,325
4,But the unexpected often happens. ,325,359
5,"Before the king's daughter began to grow up, the queen her mother fell ill and died. ",359,444
6,"It is not hard to imagine the grief that reigned, not alone in the royal castle, but throughout the land; ",444,550
7, for the queen had been beloved of all. ,549,589
8,"The king grieved so that he would not marry again, and his one joy was the little princess. ",589,681
9,"A long time passed, and with each succeeding day the king's daughter grew taller and more beautiful, and her father granted her every wish. ",681,821
10,Now there were a number of women who had nothing to do but wait on the princess and carry out her commands. ,821,929
11,Among them was a woman who had formerly married and had two daughters. ,929,1000
12,"She had an engaging appearance, a smooth tongue and a winning way of talking, and she was as soft and pliable as silk; ",1000,1119
13, but at heart she was full of machinations and falseness. ,1118,1176
14,"Now when the queen died, she at once began to plan how she might marry the king, so that her daughters might be kept like royal princesses. ",1176,1316
15,"With this end in view, she drew the young princess to her. ",1316,1375
16,"She paid her the most fulsome compliments on everything she said and did, and was forever bringing the conversation around to how happy she would be were the king to take another wife. ",1375,1560
17,"There was much said on this head, early and late, and before very long the princess came to believe that the woman knew all there was to know about everything. ",1560,1720
18,So she asked her what sort of a woman the king ought to choose for a wife. ,1720,1795
19,"The woman answered as sweet as honey: ""It is not my affair to give advice in this matter; ",1795,1885
20, yet he should choose for queen some one who is kind to the little princess. ,1884,1961
21,"For one thing I know, and that is, were I fortunate enough to be chosen, my one thought would be to do all I could for the little princess, and if she wished to wash her hands, one of my daughters would have to hold the wash-bowl and the other hand her the towel."" ",1961,2226
22,"This and much more she told the king's daughter, and the princess believed it, as children will. ",2226,2323
23,"From that day forward the princess gave her father no peace, and begged him again and again to marry the good court lady. ",2323,2445
24,Yet he did not want to marry her. ,2445,2479
25,But the king's daughter gave him no rest. ,2479,2521
26,"She urged him again and again, as the false court lady had persuaded her to do. ",2521,2601
27,"Finally, one day, when she again brought up the matter, the king cried: ""I can see you will end by having your own way about this, even though it be entirely against my will. ",2601,2776
28,"But I will do so only on one condition."" ",2776,2817
29,"""What is the condition?"" ",2817,2842
30,asked the princess. ,2842,2862
31,"""If I marry again,"" said the king, ""it is only because of your ceaseless pleading. ",2862,2945
32,"Therefore you must promise that, if in the future you are not satisfied with your step-mother or your step-sisters, not a single lament or complaint on your part reaches my ears."" ",2945,3125
33,"This she promised the king, and it was agreed that he should marry the court lady and make her queen of the whole country. ",3125,3248
34,"As time passed on, the king's daughter had grown to be the most beautiful maiden to be found far and wide. ",3248,3355
35,"The queen's daughters, on the other hand, were homely, evil of disposition, and no one knew any good of them. ",3355,3465
36,Hence it was not surprising that many youths came from East and West to sue for the princess's hand; ,3465,3566
37, but that none of them took any interest in the queen's daughters. ,3565,3632
38,This made the step-mother very angry;.,3632,3670
39,. ,67,69
40,"She concealed her rage, and was as sweet and friendly as ever. ",3671,3734
41,Among the wooers was a king's son from another country. ,3734,3790
42,"He was young and brave, and since he loved the princess dearly, she accepted his proposal and they plighted their troth. ",3790,3911
43,"The queen observed this with an angry eye, for it would have pleased her had the prince chosen one of her own daughters. ",3911,4032
44,"She therefor made up her mind that the young pair should never be happy together, and from that time on thought only of how she might part them from each other. ",4032,4193
45,An opportunity soon offered itself. ,4193,4229
46,"News came that the enemy had entered the land, and the king was compelled to go to war. ",4229,4317
47,Now the princess began to find out the kind of step-mother she had. ,4317,4385
48,"For no sooner had the king departed than the queen showed her true nature, and was just as harsh and unkind as she formerly had pretended to be friendly and obliging. ",4385,4552
49,Not a day went by without her scolding and threatening the princess and the queen's daughters were every bit as malicious as their mother. ,4552,4691
50,"But the king's son, the lover of the princess, found himself in even worse position. ",4691,4776
51,"He had gone hunting one day, had lost his way, and could not find his people. ",4776,4854
52,"Then the queen used her black arts and turned him into a werewolf, to wander through the forest for the remainder of his life in that shape. ",4854,4995
53,"When evening came and there was no sign of the prince, his people returned home, and one can imagine what sorrow they caused when the princess learned how the hunt had ended. ",4995,5170
54,"She grieved, wept day and night, and was not to be consoled. ",5170,5231
55,"But the queen laughed at her grief, and her heart was filled with joy to think that all had turned out exactly as she wished. ",5231,5357
56,"Now it chanced one day, as the king's daughter was sitting alone in her room, that she thought she would go herself into the forest where the prince had disappeared. ",5357,5523
57,"She went to her step-mother and begged permission to go out into the forest, in order to forget her surpassing grief. ",5523,5641
58,"The queen did not want to grant her request, for she always preferred saying no to yes. ",5641,5729
59,"But the princess begged her so winningly that at last she was unable to say no, and she ordered one of her daughters to go along with her and watch her. ",5729,5882
60,"That caused a great deal of discussion, for neither of the step-daughters wanted to go with her. ",5882,5979
61,"Each made all sorts of excuses, and asked what pleasures were there in going with the king's daughter, who did nothing but cry. ",5979,6107
62,"But the queen had the last word in the end, and ordered that one of her daughters must accompany the princess, even though it be against her will. ",6107,6254
63,So the girls wandered out of the castle into the forest. ,6254,6311
64,"The king's daughter walked among the trees, and listened to the song of the birds, and thought of her lover, for whom she longed, and who was now no longer there. ",6311,6474
65,"And the queen's daughter followed her, vexed, in her malice, with the king's daughter and her sorrow. ",6474,6576
66,"After they had walked a while, they came to a little hut, lying deep in the dark forest. ",6576,6665
67,"By then the king's daughter was very thirsty, and wanted to go into the little hut with her step-sister, in order to get a drink of water. ",6665,6804
68,"But the queen's daughter was much annoyed and said: ""Is it not enough for me to be running around here in the wilderness with you? ",6804,6935
69,"Now you even want me, who am a princess, to enter that wretched little hut. ",6935,7011
70,"No, I will not step a foot over the threshold! ",7011,7058
71,"If you want to go in, why go in alone!"" ",7058,7098
72,The king's daughter lost no time; ,7098,7132
73," but did as her step-sister advised, and stepped into the little hut. ",7131,7201
74,"When she entered she saw an old woman sitting there on a bench, so enfeebled by age that her head shook. ",7201,7306
75,"The princess spoke to her in her usual friendly way: ""Good evening, motherkin. ",7306,7385
76,"May I ask you for a drink of water?"" ",7385,7422
77,"""You are heartily welcome to it,"" said the old woman. ",7422,7476
78,"""Who may you be, that step beneath my lowly roof and greet me in so winning a way?"" ",7476,7560
79,"The king's daughter told her who she was, and that she had gone out to relieve her heart, in order to forget her great grief. ",7560,7686
80,"""And what may your great grief be?"" ",7686,7722
81,asked the old woman. ,7722,7743
82,"""No doubt it is my fate to grieve,"" said the princess, ""and I can never be happy again. ",7743,7831
83,"I have lost my only love, and God alone knows whether I shall ever see him again."" ",7831,7914
84,"And she also told her why it was, and the tears ran down her cheeks in streams, so that any one would have felt sorry for her. ",7914,8041
85,"When she had ended the old woman said: ""You did well in confiding your sorrow to me. ",8041,8126
86,I have lived long and may be able to give you a bit of good advice. ,8126,8194
87,When you leave here you will see a lily growing from the ground. ,8194,8259
88,"This lily is not like other lilies, however, but has many strange virtues. ",8259,8334
89,"Run quickly over to it, and pick it. ",8334,8371
90,"If you can do that then you need not worry, for then one will appear who will tell you what to do."" ",8371,8471
91,Then they parted and the king's daughter thanked her and went her way; ,8471,8542
92, while the old woman sat on the bench and wagged her head. ,8541,8600
93,"But the queen's daughter had been standing without the hut the entire time, vexing herself, and grumbling because the king's daughter had taken so long. ",8600,8753
94,"So when the latter stepped out, she had to listen to all sorts of abuse from her step-sister, as was to be expected. ",8753,8870
95,"Yet she paid no attention to her, and thought only of how she might find the flower of which the old woman had spoken. ",8870,8989
96,"They went through the forest, and suddenly she saw a beautiful white lily growing in their very path. ",8989,9091
97,She was much pleased and ran up at once to pick it; ,9091,9143
98, but that very moment it disappeared and reappeared somewhat further away. ,9142,9217
99,"The king's daughter was now filled with eagerness, no longer listened to her step-sister's calls, and kept right on running. ",9217,9342
100,"Yet each time when she stooped to pick the lily, it suddenly disappeared and reappeared somewhat further away. ",9342,9453
101,"Thus it went for some time, and the princess was drawn further and further into the deep forest. ",9453,9550
102,"But the lily continued to stand, and disappear and move further away, and each time the flower seemed larger and more beautiful than before. ",9550,9691
103,"At length the princess came to a high hill, and as she looked toward its summit, there stood the lily high on the naked rock, glittering as white and radiant as the brightest star. ",9691,9872
104,"The king's daughter now began to climb the hill, and in her eagerness she paid no attention to stones nor steepness. ",9872,9989
105,"And when at last she reached the summit of the hill, lo and behold! ",9989,10057
106,the lily no longer evaded her grasp; ,10057,10094
107," but remained where it was, and the princess stooped and picked it and hid it in her bosom, and so heartfelt was her happiness that she forgot her step-sisters and everything else in the world. ",10093,10287
108,For a long time she did not tire of looking at the beautiful flower. ,10287,10356
109,Then she suddenly began to wonder what her step-mother would say when she came home after having remained out so long. ,10356,10475
110,"And she looked around, in order to find the way back to the castle. ",10475,10543
111,"But as she looked around, behold, the sun had set and no more than a little strip of daylight rested on the summit of the hill. ",10543,10671
112,"Below her lay the forest, so dark and shadowed that she had no faith in her ability to find the homeward path. ",10671,10782
113,"And now she grew very sad, for she could think of nothing better to do than to spend the night on the hill-top. ",10782,10894
114,"She seated herself on the rock, put her hand to her cheek, cried, and thought of her unkind step-mother and step-sisters, and of all the harsh words she would have to endure when she returned. ",10894,11087
115,"And she thought of her father, the king, who was away at war, and of the love of her heart, whom she would never see again. ",11087,11211
116,She grieved so bitterly that she did not even know she wept. ,11211,11272
117,"Night came and darkness, and the stars rose, and still the princess sat in the same spot and wept. ",11272,11371
118,"And while she sat there, lost in her thoughts, she heard a voice say: ""Good evening, lovely maiden! ",11371,11471
119,"Why do you sit here so sad and lonely?"" ",11471,11511
120,"She stood up hastily, and felt much embarrassed, which was not surprising. ",11511,11586
121,"When she looked around there was nothing to be seen but a tiny old man, who nodded to her and seemed to be very humble. ",11586,11706
122,"She answered: ""Yes, it is no doubt my fate to grieve, and never be happy again. ",11706,11786
123,"I have lost my dearest love, and now I have lost my way in the forest, and am afraid of being devoured by wild beasts."" ",11786,11906
124,"""As to that,"" said the old man, ""you need have no fear. ",11906,11962
125,"If you will do exactly as I say, I will help you."" ",11962,12013
126,This made the princess happy; ,12013,12043
127, for she felt that all the rest of the world had abandoned her. ,12042,12106
128,"Then the old man drew out flint and steel and said: ""Lovely maiden, you must first build a fire."" ",12106,12204
129,"She did as he told her, gathered moss, brush and dry sticks, struck sparks and lit such a fire on the hill-top that the flame blazed up to the skies. ",12204,12354
130,"That done the old man said: ""Go on a bit and you will find a kettle of tar, and bring the kettle to me."" ",12354,12459
131,This the king's daughter did. ,12459,12489
132,"The old man continued: ""Now put the kettle on the fire."" ",12489,12546
133,And the princess did that as well. ,12546,12581
134,"When the tar began to boil, the old man said: ""Now throw your white lily into the kettle."" ",12581,12672
135,"The princess thought this a harsh command, and earnestly begged to be allowed to keep the lily. ",12672,12768
136,"But the old man said: ""Did you not promise to obey my every command? ",12768,12837
137,"Do as I tell you or you will regret it."" ",12837,12878
138,"The king's daughter turned away her eyes, and threw the lily into the boiling tar; ",12878,12961
139," but it was altogether against her will, so fond had she grown of the beautiful flower. ",12960,13048
140,"The moment she did so a hollow roar, like that of some wild beast, sounded from the forest. ",13048,13140
141,"It came nearer, and turned into such a terrible howling that all the surrounding hills reechoed it. ",13140,13240
142,"Finally there was a cracking and breaking among the trees, the bushes were thrust aside, and the princess saw a great grey wolf come running out of the forest and straight up the hill. ",13240,13425
143,"She was much frightened and would gladly have run away, had she been able. ",13425,13500
144,"But the old man said: ""Make haste, run to the edge of the hill and the moment the wolf comes along, upset the kettle on him!"" ",13500,13626
145,"The princess was terrified, and hardly knew what she was about. ",13626,13690
146,"Yet she did as the old man said, took the kettle, ran to the edge of the hill, and poured its contents over the wolf just as he was about to run up. ",13690,13839
147,"And then a strange thing happened: no sooner had she done so, than the wolf was transformed, cast off his thick grey pelt, and in place of the horrible wild beast, there stood a handsome young man, looking up to the hill. ",13839,14061
148,"And when the king's daughter collected herself and looked at him, she saw that it was really and truly her lover, who had been turned into a werewolf. ",14061,14212
149,It is easy to imagine how the princess felt. ,14212,14257
150,"She opened her arms, and could neither ask questions nor reply to them, so moved and delighted was she. ",14257,14361
151,"But the prince ran hastily up the hill, embraced her tenderly, and thanked her for delivering him. ",14361,14460
152,"Nor did he forget the little old man, but thanked him with many civil expressions for his powerful aid. ",14460,14564
153,"Then they sat down together on the hill-top, and had a pleasant talk. ",14564,14634
154,"The prince told how he had been turned into a wolf, and of all he had suffered while running about in the forest; ",14634,14748
155," and the princess told of her grief, and the many tears she had shed while he had been gone. ",14747,14840
156,"So they sat the whole night through, and never noticed it until the stars grew pale and it was light enough to see. ",14840,14956
157,"When the sun rose, they saw that a broad path led from the hill-top straight to the royal castle; ",14956,15054
158, for they had a view of the whole surrounding country from the hill-top. ,15053,15126
159,"Then the old man said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! ",15126,15178
160,"Do you see anything out yonder?"" ",15178,15211
161,"""Yes,"" said the princess, ""I see a horseman on a foaming horse, riding as fast as he can."" ",15211,15302
162,"Then the old man said: ""He is a messenger sent on ahead by the king your father. ",15302,15383
163,"And your father with all his army is following him."" ",15383,15436
164,"That pleased the princess above all things, and she wanted to descend the hill at once to meet her father. ",15436,15543
165,"But the old man detained her and said: ""Wait a while, it is too early yet. ",15543,15618
166,"Let us wait and see how everything turns out."" ",15618,15665
167,"Time passed and the sun was shining brightly, and its rays fell straight on the royal castle down below. ",15665,15770
168,"Then the old man said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! ",15126,15178
169,"Do you see anything down below?"" ",15822,15855
170,"""Yes,"" replied the princess, ""I see a number of people coming out of my father's castle, and some are going along the road, and others into the forest."" ",15855,16008
171,"The old man said: ""Those are your step-mother's servants. ",16008,16066
172,"She has sent some to meet the king and welcome him but she has sent others to the forest to look for you."" ",16066,16173
173,"At these words the princess grew uneasy, and wished to go down to the queen's servants. ",16173,16261
174,"But the old man withheld her and said: ""Wait a while, and let us first see how everything turns out."" ",16261,16363
175,"More time passed, and the king's daughter was still looking down the road from which the king would appear, when the old man said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! ",16363,16523
176,"Do you see anything down below?"" ",15822,15855
177,"""Yes,"" answered the princess, ""there is a great commotion in my father's castle, and they are hanging it with black."" ",16556,16674
178,"The old man said: ""That is your step-mother and her people. ",16674,16734
179,"They will assure your father that you are dead."" ",16734,16783
180,"Then the king's daughter felt bitter anguish, and she implored from the depths of her heart: ""Let me go, let me go, so that I may spare my father this anguish!"" ",16783,16944
181,"But the old man detained her and said: ""No, wait, it is still too early. ",16944,17017
182,"Let us first see how everything turns out."" ",17017,17061
183,"Again time passed, the sun lay high above the fields, and the warm air blew over meadow and forest. ",17061,17161
184,"The royal maid and youth still sat on the hill-top with the old man, where we had left them. ",17161,17254
185,"Then they saw a little cloud rise against the horizon, far away in the distance, and the little cloud grew larger and larger, and came nearer and nearer along the road, and as it moved one could see it was agleam with weapons, and nodding helmets, and waving flags, one could hear the rattle of swords, and the neighing of horses, and finally recognize the banner of the king. ",17254,17631
186,"It is not hard to imagine how pleased the king's daughter was, and how she insisted on going down and greeting her father. ",17631,17754
187,"But the old man held her back and said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! ",17754,17823
188,"Do you see anything happening at the castle?"" ",17823,17869
189,"""Yes,"" answered the princess, ""I can see my step-mother and step-sisters coming out, dressed in mourning, holding white kerchiefs to their faces, and weeping bitterly."" ",17869,18038
190,"The old man answered: ""Now they are pretending to weep because of your death. ",18038,18116
191,Wait just a little while longer. ,18116,18149
192,"We have not yet seen how everything will turn out."" ",18149,18201
193,"After a time the old man said again: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! ",18201,18267
194,"Do you see anything down below?"" ",15822,15855
195,"""Yes,"" said the princess, ""I see people bringing a black coffin-now my father is having it opened. ",18300,18399
196,"Look, the queen and her daughters are down on their knees, and my father is threatening them with his sword!"" ",18399,18509
197,"Then the old man said: ""Your father wished to see your body, and so your evil step-mother had to confess the truth."" ",18509,18626
198,"When the princess heard that she said earnestly: ""Let me go, let me go, so that I may comfort my father in his great sorrow!"" ",18626,18752
199,"But the old man held her back and said: ""Take my advice and stay here a little while longer. ",18752,18845
200,"We have not yet seen how everything will turn out."" ",18149,18201
201,"Again time went by, and the king's daughter and the prince and the old man were still sitting on the hill-top. ",18897,19008
202,"Then the old man said: ""Lovely maiden, turn around! ",15126,15178
203,"Do you see anything down below?"" ",15822,15855
204,"""Yes,"" answered the princess, ""I see my father and my step-sisters and my step-mother with all their following moving this way."" ",19093,19222
205,"The old man said: ""Now they have started out to look for you. ",19222,19284
206,"Go down and bring up the wolf's pelt in the gorge."" ",19284,19336
207,The king's daughter did as he told her. ,19336,19376
208,"The old man continued: ""Now stand at the edge of the hill."" ",19376,19436
209,"And the princess did that, too. ",19436,19468
210,"Now one could see the queen and her daughters coming along the way, and stopping just below the hill. ",19468,19570
211,"Then the old man said: ""Now throw down the wolf's pelt!"" ",19570,19627
212,"The princess obeyed him, and threw down the wolf's pelt according to his command. ",19627,19709
213,It fell directly on the evil queen and her daughters. ,19709,19763
214,"And then a most wonderful thing happened: no sooner had the pelt touched the three evil women than they immediately changed shape, and turning into three horrible werewolves, they ran away as fast as they could into the forest, howling dreadfully. ",19763,20011
215,No more had this happened than the king himself arrived at the foot of the hill with his whole retinue. ,20011,20115
216,"When he looked up and recognized the princess, he could not at first believe his eyes; ",20115,20202
217," but stood motionless, thinking her a vision. ",20201,20247
218,"Then the old man cried: ""Lovely maiden, now hasten, run down and make your father happy!"" ",20247,20337
219,There was no need to tell the princess twice. ,20337,20383
220,She took her lover by the hand and they ran down the hill. ,20383,20442
221,"When they came to the king, the princess ran on ahead, fell on her father's neck, and wept with joy. ",20442,20543
222,"And the young prince wept as well, and the king himself wept; ",20543,20605
223, and their meeting was a pleasant sight for every one. ,20604,20659
224,"There was great joy and many embraces, and the princess told of her evil step-mother and step-sisters and of her lover, and all that she had suffered, and of the old man who had helped them in such a wonderful way. ",20659,20874
225,"But when the king turned around to thank the old man he had completely vanished, and from that day on no one could say who he had been or what had become of him. ",20874,21036
226,"The king and his whole retinue now returned to the castle, where the king had a splendid banquet prepared, to which he invited all the able and distinguished people throughout the kingdom, and bestowed his daughter on the young prince. ",21036,21272
227,And the wedding was celebrated with gladness and music and amusements of every kind for many days. ,21272,21371
228,"I was there, too, and when I rode through the forest I met a wolf with two young wolves, and they showed me their teeth and seemed very angry. ",21371,21514
229,And I was told they were none other than the evil step-mother and her two daughters.,21514,21599
