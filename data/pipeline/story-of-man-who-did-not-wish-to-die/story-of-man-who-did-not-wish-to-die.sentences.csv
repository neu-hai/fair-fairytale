0,"Long, long ago there lived a man called Sentaro. ",0,49
1,"His surname meant ""Millionaire,"" but although he was not so rich as all that, he was still very far removed from being poor. ",49,174
2,He had inherited a small fortune from his father and lived on this. ,174,242
3,"He spent his time carelessly, without any serious thoughts of work, till he was about thirty-two years of age. ",242,353
4,"One day, without any reason whatsoever, the thought of death and sickness came to him. ",353,440
5,The idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched. ,440,497
6,"""I should like to live,"" he said to himself, ""till I am five or six hundred years old at least, free from all sickness. ",497,617
7,"The ordinary span of a man's life is very short."" ",617,667
8,"He wondered whether it were possible, by living simply and frugally henceforth, to prolong his life as long as he wished. ",667,789
9,He knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors who had lived a thousand years. ,789,884
10,"There was a Princess of Yamato, who, it was said, lived to the age of five hundred. ",884,968
11,This was the latest story of a very long life record. ,968,1022
12,Sentaro had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no-Shiko. ,1022,1096
13,He was one of the most able and powerful rulers in Chinese history. ,1096,1164
14,"He built all the large palaces, and also the famous great wall of China. ",1164,1237
15,He had everything in the world he could wish for. ,1237,1287
16,"But in spite of all his happiness and the luxury and the splendor of his Court, the wisdom of his councilors and the glory of his reign, he was miserable because he knew that one day he must die and leave it all. ",1287,1500
17,"When Shin-no-Shiko went to bed at night, when he rose in the morning, as he went through his day, the thought of death was always with him. ",1500,1640
18,He could not get away from it. ,1640,1671
19,"Ah-if only he could find the ""Elixir of Life,"" he would be happy. ",1671,1737
20,"The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and asked them all if they could not find for him the ""Elixir of Life"" of which he had so often read and heard. ",1737,1903
21,"One old courtier, Jofuku by name, said that far away across the seas there was a country called Horaizan. ",1903,2009
22,"Certain hermits lived there who possessed the secret of the ""Elixir of Life."" ",2009,2087
23,Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever. ,2087,2142
24,"The Emperor ordered Jofuku to set out for the land of Horaizan, to find the hermits, and to bring him back a phial of the magic elixir. ",2142,2278
25,"He gave Jofuku one of his best junks, fitted it out for him, and loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for Jofuku to take as presents to the hermits. ",2278,2455
26,"Jofuku sailed for the land of Horaizan, but he never returned to the waiting Emperor. ",2455,2541
27,But ever since that time Mount Fuji has been said to be the fabled Horaizan and the home of hermits who had the secret of the elixir. ,2541,2675
28,It has been said that Jofuku has been worshiped as their patron god. ,2675,2744
29,"Now Sentaro determined to set out to find the hermits, and if he could, to become one, so that he might obtain the water of perpetual life. ",2744,2884
30,"He remembered that as a child he had been told that not only did these hermits live on Mount Fuji, but that they were said to inhabit all the very high peaks. ",2884,3043
31,"So he left his old home to the care of his relatives, and started out on his quest. ",3043,3127
32,"He traveled through all the mountainous regions of the land, climbing to the tops of the highest peaks, but never a hermit did he find. ",3127,3263
33,"At last, after wandering in an unknown region for many days, he met a hunter. ",3263,3341
34,"""Can you tell me,"" asked Sentaro, ""where the hermits live who have the Elixir of Life?"" ",3341,3429
35,"""No."" ",3429,3435
36,said the hunter; ,3435,3452
37," ""I can't tell you where such hermits live. ",3451,3495
38,"But, there is a notorious robber living in these parts. ",3495,3551
39,"It is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers."" ",3551,3616
40,This odd answer irritated Sentaro very much. ,3616,3661
41,He thought how foolish it was to waste more time in looking for the hermits in this way. ,3661,3750
42,"So he decided to go at once to the shrine of Jofuku, who is worshiped as the patron god of the hermits in the south of Japan. ",3750,3876
43,"Sentaro reached the shrine and prayed for seven days, entreating Jofuku to show him the way to a hermit who could give him what he wanted so much to find. ",3876,4031
44,"At midnight of the seventh day, as Sentaro knelt in the temple, the door of the innermost shrine flew open. ",4031,4139
45,"Jofuku appeared in a luminous cloud, and calling to Sentaro to come nearer, spoke thus: ""Your desire is a very selfish one and cannot be easily granted. ",4139,4292
46,You think that you would like to become a hermit so as to find the Elixir of Life. ,4292,4375
47,Do you know how hard a hermit's life is? ,4375,4416
48,A hermit is only allowed to eat fruit and berries and the bark of pine trees. ,4416,4494
49,A hermit must cut himself off from the world so that his heart may become as pure as gold and free from every earthly desire. ,4494,4620
50,"Gradually after following these strict rules, the hermit ceases to feel hunger or cold or heat. ",4620,4716
51,"His body becomes so light that he can ride on a crane or a carp, and can walk on water without getting his feet wet."" ",4716,4834
52,"""You, Sentaro, are fond of good living and of every comfort. ",4834,4895
53,"You are not even like an ordinary man, for you are exceptionally idle. ",4895,4966
54,You more sensitive to heat and cold than most people. ,4966,5020
55,You would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin dress in the winter time! ,5020,5110
56,"Do you think that you would ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit's life?"" ",5110,5204
57,"""In answer to your prayer, however, I will help you in another way. ",5204,5272
58,"I will send you to the country of Perpetual Life, where death never comes-where the people live forever!"" ",5272,5378
59,"Saying this, Jofuku put into Sentaro's hand a little crane made of paper, telling him to sit on its back and it would carry him there. ",5378,5513
60,Sentaro obeyed wonderingly. ,5513,5541
61,The crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort. ,5541,5605
62,"It then spread its wings, rose high in the air, and flew away over the mountains right out to sea. ",5605,5704
63,Sentaro was at first quite frightened. ,5704,5743
64,By degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air. ,5743,5810
65,On and on they went for thousands of miles. ,5810,5854
66,"The bird never stopped for rest or food, but as it was a paper bird it doubtless did not require any nourishment, and strange to say, neither did Sentaro. ",5854,6009
67,After several days they reached an island. ,6009,6052
68,The crane flew some distance inland and then alighted. ,6052,6107
69,"As soon as Sentaro got down from the bird's back, the crane folded up of its own accord and flew into his pocket. ",6107,6221
70,"Now Sentaro began to look about him wonderingly, curious to see what the country of Perpetual Life was like. ",6221,6330
71,He walked first round about the country and then through the town. ,6330,6397
72,"Everything was, of course, quite strange, and different from his own land. ",6397,6472
73,"But both the land and the people seemed prosperous, so he decided that it would be good for him to stay there. ",6472,6583
74,He took up lodgings at one of the hotels. ,6583,6625
75,The proprietor was a kind man. ,6625,6656
76,"When Sentaro told him that he was a stranger and had come to live there, he promised to arrange everything that was necessary with the governor of the city concerning Sentaro's sojourn there. ",6656,6848
77,"He even found a house for his guest, and in this way Sentaro obtained his great wish and became a resident in the country of Perpetual Life. ",6848,6989
78,"Within the memory of all the islanders no man had ever died there, and sickness was a thing unknown. ",6989,7090
79,"Priests had come over from India and China and told them of a beautiful country called Paradise, where happiness and bliss and contentment fill all men's hearts. ",7090,7252
80,But its gates could only be reached by dying. ,7252,7298
81,This tradition was handed down for ages from generation to generation-but none knew exactly what death was except that it led to Paradise. ,7298,7437
82,"Quite unlike Sentaro and other ordinary people, instead of having a great dread of death, they all, both rich and poor, longed for it as something good and desirable. ",7437,7604
83,"They were all tired of their long, long lives, and longed to go to the happy land of contentment called Paradise of which the priests had told them centuries ago. ",7604,7767
84,All this Sentaro soon found out by talking to the islanders. ,7767,7828
85,"He found himself, according to his ideas, in the land of Topsyturvydom. ",7828,7900
86,Everything was upside down. ,7900,7928
87,He had wished to escape from dying. ,7928,7964
88,"He had come to the land of Perpetual Life with great relief and joy, only to find that the inhabitants themselves, doomed never to die, would consider it bliss to find death. ",7964,8139
89,What he had hitherto considered poison these people ate as good food. ,8139,8209
90,All the things to which he had been accustomed as food they rejected. ,8209,8279
91,"Whenever any merchants from other countries arrived, the rich people rushed to them eager to buy poisons. ",8279,8385
92,"These they swallowed eagerly, hoping for death to come so that they might go to Paradise. ",8385,8475
93,But what were deadly poisons in other lands were without effect in this strange place. ,8475,8562
94,People who swallowed them with the hope of dying only found that in a short time they felt better in health instead of worse. ,8562,8688
95,Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like. ,8688,8743
96,The wealthy would have given all their money and all their goods if they could but shorten their lives to two or three hundred years even. ,8743,8882
97,Without any change to live on forever seemed to this people wearisome and sad. ,8882,8961
98,In the chemist shops there was a drug which was in constant demand. ,8961,9029
99,"This was because after using it for a hundred years, it was supposed to turn the hair slightly gray and to bring about disorders of the stomach. ",9029,9174
100,"Sentaro was astonished to find that the poisonous globe-fish was served up in restaurants as a delectable dish, and hawkers in the streets went about selling sauces made of Spanish flies. ",9174,9362
101,"He never saw any one ill after eating these horrible things, nor did he ever see any one with as much as a cold. ",9362,9475
102,Sentaro was delighted. ,9475,9498
103,"He said to himself that he would never grow tired of living, and that he considered it profane to wish for death. ",9498,9612
104,He was the only happy man on the island. ,9612,9653
105,For his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life. ,9653,9722
106,"He set himself up in business, and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his native land. ",9722,9826
107,"As years went by, however, things did not go as smoothly as at first. ",9826,9896
108,"He had heavy losses in business, and several times some affairs went wrong with his neighbors. ",9896,9991
109,This caused him great annoyance. ,9991,10024
110,"Time passed like the flight of an arrow for him, for he was busy from morning till night. ",10024,10114
111,Three hundred years went by in this monotonous way. ,10114,10166
112,"Then at last he began to grow tired of life in this country, and he longed to see his own land and his old home. ",10166,10279
113,"However long he lived here, life would always be the same, so was it not foolish and wearisome to stay on here forever? ",10279,10399
114,"Sentaro, in his wish to escape from the country of Perpetual Life, recollected Jofuku, who had helped him before when he was wishing to escape from death. ",10399,10554
115,He prayed to the saint to bring him back to his own land again. ,10554,10618
116,No sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket. ,10618,10687
117,Sentaro was amazed to see that it had remained undamaged after all these years. ,10687,10767
118,Once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it. ,10767,10846
119,"As he did so, the bird spread its wings and flew, swiftly out across the sea in the direction of Japan. ",10846,10950
120,Such was the willfulness of the man's nature that he looked back and regretted all he had left behind. ,10950,11053
121,He tried to stop the bird in vain. ,11053,11088
122,The crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean. ,11088,11155
123,"Then a storm came on, and the wonderful paper crane got damp, crumpled up, and fell into the sea. ",11155,11253
124,Sentaro fell with it. ,11253,11275
125,"Very much frightened at the thought of being drowned, he cried out loudly to Jofuku to save him. ",11275,11372
126,"He looked round, but there was no ship in sight. ",11372,11421
127,"He swallowed a quantity of sea-water, which only increased his miserable plight. ",11421,11502
128,"While he was thus struggling to keep himself afloat, he saw a monstrous shark swimming towards him. ",11502,11602
129,As it came nearer it opened its huge mouth ready to devour him. ,11602,11666
130,Sentaro was all but paralyzed with fear now that he felt his end so near. ,11666,11740
131,He screamed out as loudly as ever he could to Jofuku to come and rescue him. ,11740,11817
132,"Lo, and behold, Sentaro was awakened by his own screams, to find that during his long prayer he had fallen asleep before the shrine. ",11817,11950
133,All his extraordinary and frightful adventures had been only a wild dream. ,11950,12025
134,"He was in a cold perspiration with fright, and utterly bewildered. ",12025,12092
135,"Suddenly a bright light came towards him, and in the light stood a messenger. ",12092,12170
136,"The messenger held a book in his hand, and spoke to Sentaro: ""I am sent to you by Jofuku, who in answer to your prayer, has permitted you in a dream to see the land of Perpetual Life. ",12170,12354
137,"But you grew weary of living there, and begged to be allowed to return to your native land so that you might die. ",12354,12468
138,"Jofuku, so that he might try you, allowed you to drop into the sea, and then sent a shark to swallow you up. ",12468,12577
139,"Your desire for death was not real, for even at that moment you cried out loudly and shouted for help."" ",12577,12681
140,"""It is also vain for you to wish to become a hermit, or to find the Elixir of Life. ",12681,12765
141,These things are not for such as you-your life is not austere enough. ,12765,12835
142,"It is best for you to go back to your paternal home, and to live a good and industrious life. ",12835,12929
143,"Never neglect to keep the anniversaries of your ancestors, and make it your duty to provide for your children's future. ",12929,13049
144,"Thus will you live to a good old age and be happy, but give up the vain desire to escape death, for no man can do that. ",13049,13169
145,"By this time you have surely found out that even when selfish desires are granted they do not bring happiness."" ",13169,13281
146,"""In this book I give you there are many precepts good for you to know. ",13281,13352
147,"If you study them, you will be guided in the way I have pointed out to you."" ",13352,13429
148,"The angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking, and Sentaro took the lesson to heart. ",13429,13526
149,With the book in his hand he returned to his old home. ,13526,13581
150,"Giving up all his old vain wishes, he tried to live a good and useful life and to observe the lessons taught him in the book, and he and his house prospered henceforth.",13581,13750
