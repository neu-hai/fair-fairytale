0,"Perhaps you think that fishes were always fishes, and never lived anywhere except in the water, but if you went to Australia and talked to the black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country, you would learn something quite different. ",0,249
1,"They would tell you that long, long ago you would have met fishes on the land, wandering from place to place, and hunting all sorts of animals, and if you consider how fishes are made, you will understand how difficult this must have been and how clever they were to do it. ",249,523
2,"Indeed, so clever were they that they might have been hunting still if a terrible thing had not happened. ",523,629
3,"One day the whole fish tribe came back very tired from a hunting expedition, and looked about for a nice, cool spot in which to pitch their camp. ",629,775
4,"It was very hot, and they thought that they could not find a more comfortable place than under the branches of a large tree which grew by the bank of a river. ",775,934
5,"So they made their fire to cook some food, right on the edge of a steep bank, which had a deep pool of water lying beneath it at the bottom. ",934,1075
6,"While the food was cooking they all stretched themselves lazily out under the tree, and were just dropping off to sleep when a big black cloud which they had never noticed spread over the sun, and heavy drops of rain began to fall, so that the fire was almost put out, and that, you know, is a very serious thing in savage countries where they have no matches, for it is very hard to light it again. ",1075,1475
7,"To make matters worse, an icy wind began to blow, and the poor fishes were chilled right through their bodies. ",1475,1586
8,"'This will never do,' said Thuggai, the oldest of the fish tribe. ",1586,1652
9,"'We shall die of cold unless we can light the fire again,' and he bade his sons rub two sticks together in the hope of kindling a flame, but though they rubbed till they were tired, not a spark could they produce. ",1652,1866
10,"'Let me try,' cried Biernuga, the bony fish, but he had no better luck, and no more had Kumbal, the bream, nor any of the rest. ",1866,1994
11,"'It is no use,' exclaimed Thuggai, at last. ",1994,2038
12,'The wood is too wet. ,2038,2060
13,We must just sit and wait till the sun comes out again and dries it.' ,2060,2130
14,"Then a very little fish indeed, not more than four inches long and the youngest of the tribe, bowed himself before Thuggai, saying, 'Ask my father, Guddhu the cod, to light the fire. ",2130,2313
15,He is skilled in magic more than most fishes.' ,2313,2360
16,"So Thuggai asked him, and Guddhu stripped some pieces of bark off a tree, and placed them on top of the smouldering ashes. ",2360,2483
17,"Then he knelt by the side of the fire and blew at it for a long while, till slowly the feeble red glow became a little stronger and the edges of the bark showed signs of curling up. ",2483,2665
18,"When the rest of the tribe saw this they pressed close, keeping their backs towards the piercing wind, but Guddhu told them they must go to the other side, as he wanted the wind to fan his fire. ",2665,2860
19,"By and by the spark grew into a flame, and a merry crackling was heard. ",2860,2932
20,"'More wood,' cried Guddhi, and they all ran and gathered wood and heaped it on the flames, which leaped and roared and sputtered. ",2932,3062
21,"'We shall soon be warm now,' said the people one to another. ",3062,3123
22,'Truly Guddhu is great';,3123,3147
23," and they crowded round again, closer and closer. ",3147,3197
24,"Suddenly, with a shriek, a blast of wind swept down from the hills and blew the fire out towards them. ",3197,3300
25,"They sprang back hurriedly, quite forgetting where they stood, and all fell down the bank, each tumbling over the other, till they rolled into the pool that lay below. ",3300,3468
26,"Oh, how cold it was in that dark water on which the sun never shone! ",3468,3537
27,"Then in an instant they felt warm again, for the fire, driven by the strong wind, had followed them right down to the bottom of the pool, where it burned as brightly as ever. ",3537,3712
28,"And the fishes gathered round it as they had done on the top of the cliff, and found the flames as hot as before, and that fire never went out, like those upon land, but kept burning for ever. ",3712,3905
29,"So now you know why, if you dive deep down below the cold surface of the water on a frosty day, you will find it comfortable and pleasant underneath, and be quite sorry that you cannot stay there.",3905,4102
