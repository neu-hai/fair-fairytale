0,"High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. ",0,77
1,"He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt. ",77,216
2,He was very much admired indeed. ,216,249
3,"""He is as beautiful as a weathercock,"" remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; ",249,385
4," ""only not quite so useful,"" he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not. ",384,498
5,"""Why can't you be like the Happy Prince?"" ",498,540
6,asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon. ,540,611
7,"""The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything."" ",611,667
8,"""I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,"" muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue. ",667,795
9,"""He looks just like an angel,"" said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores. ",795,950
10,"""How do you know?"" ",950,969
11,"said the Mathematical Master, ""you have never seen one."" ",969,1026
12,"""Ah! ",1026,1031
13,"but we have, in our dreams,"" answered the children; ",1031,1083
14," and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming. ",1082,1188
15,One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. ,1188,1241
16,"His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. ",1241,1369
17,"He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her. ",1369,1544
18,"""Shall I love you?"" ",1544,1564
19,"said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. ",1564,1655
20,"So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. ",1655,1749
21,"This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer. ",1749,1811
22,"""It is a ridiculous attachment,"" twittered the other Swallows; ",1811,1874
23," ""she has no money, and far too many relations"";",1873,1921
24, and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. ,1921,1968
25,"Then, when the autumn came they all flew away. ",1968,2015
26,"After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. ",2015,2087
27,"""She has no conversation,"" he said, ""and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind."" ",2087,2207
28,"And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. ",2207,2288
29,"""I admit that she is domestic,"" he continued, ""but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also."" ",2288,2415
30,"""Will you come away with me?"" ",2415,2445
31,he said finally to her; ,2445,2469
32," but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home. ",2468,2531
33,"""You have been trifling with me,"" he cried. ",2531,2575
34,"""I am off to the Pyramids. ",2575,2602
35,"Good-bye!"" ",2602,2613
36,and he flew away. ,2613,2631
37,"All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. ",2631,2695
38,"""Where shall I put up?"" ",2695,2719
39,he said; ,2719,2728
40," ""I hope the town has made preparations."" ",2727,2769
41,Then he saw the statue on the tall column. ,2769,2812
42,"""I will put up there,"" he cried; ",2812,2845
43," ""it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air."" ",2844,2896
44,So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince. ,2896,2954
45,"""I have a golden bedroom,"" he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; ",2954,3059
46, but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. ,3058,3145
47,"""What a curious thing!"" ",3145,3169
48,he cried; ,2835,2845
49," ""there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. ",3178,3281
50,The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. ,3281,3336
51,"The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness."" ",3336,3406
52,Then another drop fell. ,3406,3430
53,"""What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?"" ",3430,3492
54,he said; ,2719,2728
55," ""I must look for a good chimney-pot,"" and he determined to fly away. ",3500,3570
56,"But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw-Ah! ",3570,3655
57,what did he see? ,3655,3672
58,"The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. ",3672,3772
59,His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity. ,3772,3861
60,"""Who are you?"" ",3861,3876
61,he said. ,3876,3885
62,"""I am the Happy Prince."" ",3885,3910
63,"""Why are you weeping then?"" ",3910,3938
64,asked the Swallow; ,3938,3957
65," ""you have quite drenched me."" ",3956,3987
66,"""When I was alive and had a human heart,"" answered the statue, ""I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. ",3987,4162
67,"In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. ",4162,4274
68,"Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. ",4274,4397
69,"My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. ",4397,4488
70,"So I lived, and so I died. ",4488,4515
71,"And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep."" ",4515,4700
72,"""What! ",4700,4707
73,"is he not solid gold?"" ",4707,4730
74,said the Swallow to himself. ,4730,4759
75,He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud. ,4759,4816
76,"""Far away,"" continued the statue in a low musical voice, ""far away in a little street there is a poor house. ",4816,4925
77,"One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. ",4925,5005
78,"Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. ",5005,5115
79,She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball. ,5115,5248
80,In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. ,5248,5312
81,"He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. ",5312,5355
82,"His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. ",5355,5424
83,"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? ",5424,5512
84,"My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move."" ",5512,5570
85,"""I am waited for in Egypt,"" said the Swallow. ",5570,5616
86,"""My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. ",5616,5701
87,Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. ,5701,5759
88,The King is there himself in his painted coffin. ,5759,5808
89,"He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. ",5808,5865
90,"Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves."" ",5865,5952
91,"""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? ",5952,6068
92,"The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad."" ",6068,6115
93,"""I don't think I like boys,"" answered the Swallow. ",6115,6166
94,"""Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing stones at me. ",6166,6297
95,"They never hit me, of course; ",6297,6327
96," we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; ",6326,6422
97," but still, it was a mark of disrespect."" ",6421,6463
98,But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. ,6463,6533
99,"""It is very cold here,"" he said; ",6533,6566
100," ""but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger."" ",6565,6631
101,"""Thank you, little Swallow,"" said the Prince. ",6631,6677
102,"So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince's sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town. ",6677,6805
103,"He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. ",6805,6886
104,He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. ,6886,6942
105,A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. ,6942,6999
106,"""How wonderful the stars are,"" he said to her, ""and how wonderful is the power of love!"" ",6999,7088
107,"""I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,"" she answered; ",7088,7162
108," ""I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; ",7161,7219
109," but the seamstresses are so lazy."" ",7218,7254
110,"He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships. ",7254,7336
111,"He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales. ",7336,7453
112,At last he came to the poor house and looked in. ,7453,7502
113,"The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. ",7502,7597
114,"In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman's thimble. ",7597,7676
115,"Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy's forehead with his wings. ",7676,7754
116,"""How cool I feel,"" said the boy, ""I must be getting better"";",7754,7814
117, and he sank into a delicious slumber. ,7814,7853
118,"Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. ",7853,7932
119,"""It is curious,"" he remarked, ""but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold."" ",7932,8015
120,"""That is because you have done a good action,"" said the Prince. ",8015,8079
121,"And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. ",8079,8143
122,Thinking always made him sleepy. ,8143,8176
123,When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. ,8176,8233
124,"""What a remarkable phenomenon,"" said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. ",8233,8334
125,"""A swallow in winter!"" ",8334,8357
126,And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. ,8357,8417
127,"Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand. ",8417,8499
128,"""To-night I go to Egypt,"" said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect. ",8499,8587
129,"He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple. ",8587,8674
130,"Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, ""What a distinguished stranger!"" ",8674,8772
131,so he enjoyed himself very much. ,8772,8805
132,When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. ,8805,8858
133,"""Have you any commissions for Egypt?"" ",8858,8896
134,he cried; ,2835,2845
135," ""I am just starting."" ",8905,8928
136,"""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""will you not stay with me one night longer?"" ",8928,9027
137,"""I am waited for in Egypt,"" answered the Swallow. ",9027,9077
138,"""To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract. ",9077,9135

140,"All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. ",9237,9356
141,At noon the yellow lions come down to the water's edge to drink. ,9356,9421
142,"They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract."" ",9421,9512
143,"""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""far away across the city I see a young man in a garret. ",9512,9622
144,"He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. ",9622,9736
145,"His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. ",9736,9838
146,"He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more. ",9838,9939
147,"There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint."" ",9939,10002
148,"""I will wait with you one night longer,"" said the Swallow, who really had a good heart. ",10002,10090
149,"""Shall I take him another ruby?"" ",10090,10123
150,"""Alas! ",10123,10130
151,"I have no ruby now,"" said the Prince; ",10130,10168
152," ""my eyes are all that I have left. ",10167,10203
153,"They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. ",10203,10290
154,Pluck out one of them and take it to him. ,10290,10332
155,"He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play."" ",10332,10414
156,"""Dear Prince,"" said the Swallow, ""I cannot do that"";",10414,10466
157, and he began to weep. ,10466,10489
158,"""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""do as I command you."" ",10489,10565
159,"So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret. ",10565,10649
160,"It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof. ",10649,10712
161,"Through this he darted, and came into the room. ",10712,10760
162,"The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird's wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets. ",10760,10945
163,"""I am beginning to be appreciated,"" he cried; ",10945,10991
164," ""this is from some great admirer. ",10990,11025
165,"Now I can finish my play,"" and he looked quite happy. ",11025,11079
166,The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. ,11079,11130
167,He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. ,11130,11238
168,"""Heave a-hoy!"" ",11238,11253
169,they shouted as each chest came up. ,11253,11289
170,"""I am going to Egypt""! ",11289,11312
171,"cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. ",11312,11407
172,"""I am come to bid you good-bye,"" he cried. ",11407,11450
173,"""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""will you not stay with me one night longer?"" ",8928,9027
174,"""It is winter,"" answered the Swallow, ""and the chill snow will soon be here. ",11549,11626
175,"In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. ",11626,11738
176,"My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. ",11738,11872
177,"Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. ",11872,12030
178,"The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea."" ",12030,12125
179,"""In the square below,"" said the Happy Prince, ""there stands a little match-girl. ",12125,12206

181,"Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. ",12276,12359
182,"She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. ",12359,12419
183,"Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her."" ",12419,12498
184,"""I will stay with you one night longer,"" said the Swallow, ""but I cannot pluck out your eye. ",12498,12591
185,"You would be quite blind then."" ",12591,12623
186,"""Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""do as I command you."" ",10489,10565
187,"So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted down with it. ",12699,12766
188,"He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. ",12766,12847
189,"""What a lovely bit of glass,"" cried the little girl; ",12847,12900
190," and she ran home, laughing. ",12899,12928
191,Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. ,12928,12970
192,"""You are blind now,"" he said, ""so I will stay with you always."" ",12970,13034
193,"""No, little Swallow,"" said the poor Prince, ""you must go away to Egypt."" ",13034,13107
194,"""I will stay with you always,"" said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet. ",13107,13191
195,"All the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. ",13191,13300
196,"He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; ",13300,13416
197," of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; ",13415,13513
198," of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; ",13512,13614
199," of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; ",13613,13712
200," of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; ",13711,13817
201," and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies. ",13816,13927
202,"""Dear little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. ",13927,14074

204,"Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there."" ",14114,14181
205,"So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. ",14181,14324
206,"He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. ",14324,14439
207,Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another's arms to try and keep themselves warm. ,14439,14551
208,"""How hungry we are!"" ",14551,14572
209,they said. ,14572,14583
210,"""You must not lie here,"" shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain. ",14583,14667
211,Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen. ,14667,14723
212,"""I am covered with fine gold,"" said the Prince, ""you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; ",14723,14832
213," the living always think that gold can make them happy."" ",14831,14888
214,"Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. ",14888,14995
215,"Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. ",14995,15139
216,"""We have bread now!"" ",15139,15160
217,they cried. ,15160,15172
218,"Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. ",15172,15227
219,"The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; ",15227,15314
220," long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice. ",15313,15479
221,"The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well. ",15479,15585
222,He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings. ,15585,15715
223,But at last he knew that he was going to die. ,15715,15761
224,He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more. ,15761,15828
225,"""Good-bye, dear Prince!"" ",15828,15853
226,"he murmured, ""will you let me kiss your hand?"" ",15853,15900
227,"""I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,"" said the Prince, ""you have stayed too long here; ",15900,16014
228," but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you."" ",16013,16065
229,"""It is not to Egypt that I am going,"" said the Swallow. ",16065,16121
230,"""I am going to the House of Death. ",16121,16156
231,"Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?"" ",16156,16199
232,"And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet. ",16199,16275
233,"At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. ",16275,16361
234,The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. ,16361,16421
235,It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. ,16421,16463
236,Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. ,16463,16566
237,"As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: ""Dear me! ",16566,16630
238,"how shabby the Happy Prince looks!"" ",16630,16666
239,he said. ,3876,3885
240,"""How shabby indeed!"" ",16675,16696
241,"cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; ",16696,16758
242, and they went up to look at it. ,16757,16790
243,"""The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,"" said the Mayor in fact, ""he is litttle better than a beggar!"" ",16790,16939
244,"""Little better than a beggar,"" said the Town Councillors. ",16939,16997
245,"""And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!"" ",16997,17045
246,continued the Mayor. ,17045,17066
247,"""We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here."" ",17066,17150
248,And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion. ,17150,17200
249,So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. ,17200,17252
250,"""As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,"" said the Art Professor at the University. ",17252,17349
251,"Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. ",17349,17485
252,"""We must have another statue, of course,"" he said, ""and it shall be a statue of myself."" ",17485,17574
253,"""Of myself,"" said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled. ",17574,17643
254,When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still. ,17643,17698
255,"""What a strange thing!"" ",17698,17722
256,said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. ,17722,17771
257,"""This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. ",17771,17825
258,"We must throw it away."" ",17825,17849
259,So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying. ,17849,17920
260,"""Bring me the two most precious things in the city,"" said God to one of His Angels; ",17920,18004
261, and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird. ,18003,18066
262,"""You have rightly chosen,"" said God, ""for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.""",18066,18233
