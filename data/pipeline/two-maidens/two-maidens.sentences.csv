0,Have you ever seen a maiden? ,0,29
1,"I mean what our pavers call a maiden, a thing with which they ram down the paving-stones in the roads. ",29,132
2,"A maiden of this kind is made altogether of wood, broad below, and girt round with iron rings. ",132,227
3,"At the top she is narrow, and has a stick passed across through her waist, and this stick forms the arms of the maiden. ",227,347
4,In the shed stood two Maidens of this kind. ,347,391
5,"They had their place among shovels, hand-carts, wheelbarrows, and measuring-tapes; ",391,474
6," and to all this company the news had come that the Maidens were no longer to be called ""maidens,"" but ""hand-rammers,"" which word was the newest and the only correct designation among the pavers for the thing we all know from the old times by the name of ""the maiden."" ",473,742
7,"Now, there are among us human creatures certain individuals who are known as ""emancipated women,"" as, for instance, principals of institutions, dancers who stand professionally on one leg, milliners, and sick-nurses; ",742,959
8, and with this class of emancipated women the two Maidens in the shed associated themselves. ,958,1051
9,"They were ""maidens"" among the paver folk, and determined not to give up this honorable appellation, and let themselves be miscalled ""rammers."" ",1051,1194
10,"""Maiden is a human name, but hand-rammer is a thing, and we won't be called things--that's insulting us."" ",1194,1300
11,"""My lover would be ready to give up his engagement,"" said the youngest, who was betrothed to a paver's hammer; ",1300,1411
12," and the hammer is the thing which drives great piles into the earth, like a machine, and therefore does on a large scale what ten maidens effect in a similar way. ",1410,1574
13,"""He wants to marry me as a maiden, but whether he would have me were I a hand-rammer is a question, so I won't have my name changed."" ",1574,1708
14,"""And I,"" said the elder one, ""would rather have both my arms broken off."" ",1708,1782
15,But the Wheelbarrow was of a different opinion; ,1782,1830
16," and the Wheelbarrow was looked upon as of some consequence, for he considered himself a quarter of a coach, because he went about upon one wheel. ",1829,1976
17,"""I must submit to your notice,"" he said, ""that the name 'maiden' is common enough, and not nearly so refined as 'hand-rammer,' or 'stamper,' which latter has also been proposed, and through which you would be introduced into the category of seals; ",1976,2224
18," and only think of the great stamp of state, which impresses the royal seal that gives effect to the laws! ",2223,2330
19,"No, in your case I would surrender my maiden name."" ",2330,2382
20,"""No, certainly not!"" ",2382,2403
21,exclaimed the elder. ,2403,2424
22,"""I am too old for that."" ",2424,2449
23,"""I presume you have never heard of what is called 'European necessity?'"" ",2449,2522
24,observed the honest Measuring Tape. ,2522,2558
25,"""One must be able to adapt one's self to time and circumstances, and if there is a law that the 'maiden' is to be called 'hand-rammer,' why, she must be called 'hand-rammer,' and no pouting will avail, for everything has its measure."" ",2558,2793
26,"""No; ",2793,2798
27," if there must be a change,"" said the younger, ""I should prefer to be called 'Missy,' for that reminds one a little of maidens."" ",2797,2926
28,"""But I would rather be chopped to chips,"" said the elder. ",2926,2984
29,At last they all went to work. ,2984,3015
30,"The Maidens rode--that is, they were put in a wheelbarrow, and that was a distinction; ",3015,3102
31," but still they were called ""hand-rammers."" ",3101,3145
32,"""Mai--!"" ",3145,3154
33,"they said, as they were bumped upon the pavement. ",3154,3204
34,"""Mai--!"" ",3145,3154
35,"and they were very nearly pronouncing the whole word ""maiden;""",3213,3275
36,""" but they broke off short, and swallowed the last syllable; ",3274,3335
37, for after mature deliberation they considered it beneath their dignity to protest. ,3334,3418
38,"But they always called each other ""maiden,"" and praised the good old days in which everything had been called by its right name, and those who were maidens were called maidens. ",3418,3595
39,And they remained as they were; ,3595,3627
40," for the hammer really broke off his engagement with the younger one, for nothing would suit him but he must have a maiden for his bride.",3626,3764
