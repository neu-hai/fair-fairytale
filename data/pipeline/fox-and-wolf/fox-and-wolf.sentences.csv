0,"At the foot of some high mountains there was, once upon a time, a small village, and a little way off two roads met, one of them going to the east and the other to the west. ",0,174
1,"The villagers were quiet, hard-working folk, who toiled in the fields all day, and in the evening set out for home when the bell began to ring in the little church. ",174,339
2,"In the summer mornings they led out their flocks to pasture, and were happy and contented from sunrise to sunset. ",339,453
3,"One summer night, when a round full moon shone down upon the white road, a great wolf came trotting round the corner. ",453,571
4,"'I positively must get a good meal before I go back to my den,' he said to himself; ",571,655
5," 'it is nearly a week since I have tasted anything but scraps, though perhaps no one would think it to look at my figure! ",654,776
6,Of course there are plenty of rabbits and hares in the mountains; ,776,842
7," but indeed one needs to be a greyhound to catch them, and I am not so young as I was! ",841,928
8,"If I could only dine off that fox I saw a fortnight ago, curled up into a delicious hairy ball, I should ask nothing better; ",928,1053
9," I would have eaten her then, but unluckily her husband was lying beside her, and one knows that foxes, great and small, run like the wind. ",1052,1192
10,"Really it seems as if there was not a living creature left for me to prey upon but a wolf, and, as the proverb says: 'One wolf does not bite another.' ",1192,1343
11,"However, let us see what this village can produce. ",1343,1394
12,I am as hungry as a schoolmaster.' ,1394,1429
13,"Now, while these thoughts were running through the mind of the wolf, the very fox he had been thinking of was galloping along the other road. ",1429,1571
14,"'The whole of this day I have listened to those village hens clucking till I could bear it no longer,' murmured she as she bounded along, hardly seeming to touch the ground. ",1571,1745
15,'When you are fond of fowls and eggs it is the sweetest of all music. ,1745,1815
16,"As sure as there is a sun in heaven I will have some of them this night, for I have grown so thin that my very bones rattle, and my poor babies are crying for food.' ",1815,1981
17,"And as she spoke she reached a little plot of grass, where the two roads joined, and flung herself under a tree to take a little rest, and to settle her plans. ",1981,2141
18,At this moment the wolf came up. ,2141,2174
19,"At the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water, but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was. ",2174,2314
20,"The fox's quick ears heard the sound of his paws, though they were soft as velvet, and turning her head she said politely: 'Is that you, neighbour? ",2314,2462
21,What a strange place to meet in! ,2462,2495
22,I hope you are quite well?' ,2495,2523
23,"'Quite well as regards my health,' answered the wolf, whose eye glistened greedily, 'at least, as well as one can be when one is very hungry. ",2523,2665
24,But what is the matter with you? ,2665,2698
25,A fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish!' ,2698,2754
26,"'I have been ill-very ill,' replied the fox, 'and what you say is quite true. ",2754,2832
27,A worm is fat in comparison with me.' ,2832,2870
28,He is. ,2870,2877
29,"Still, you are good enough for me; ",2877,2912
30, for 'to the hungry no bread is hard.' ,2911,2950
31,"'Oh, you are always joking! ",2950,2978
32,I'm sure you are not half as hungry as I!' ,2978,3021
33,"'That we shall soon see,' cried the wolf, opening his huge mouth and crouching for a spring. ",3021,3114
34,'What are you doing?' ,3114,3136
35,"exclaimed the fox, stepping backwards. ",3136,3175
36,'What am I doing? ,3175,3193
37,"What I am going to do is to make my supper off you, in less time than a cock takes to crow.' ",3193,3286
38,"'Well, I suppose you must have your joke,' answered the fox lightly, but never removing her eye from the wolf, who replied with a snarl which showed all his teeth: 'I don't want to joke, but to eat!' ",3286,3486
39,'But surely a person of your talents must perceive that you might eat me to the very last morsel and never know that you had swallowed anything at all!' ,3486,3639
40,"'In this world the cleverest people are always the hungriest,' replied the wolf. ",3639,3720
41,'Ah! ,3720,3725
42,how true that is; ,3725,3743
43," but-' 'I can't stop to listen to your 'buts' and 'yets,' broke in the wolf rudely; ",3742,3826
44," 'let us get to the point, and the point is that I want to eat you and not talk to you.' ",3825,3914
45,'Have you no pity for a poor mother?' ,3914,3952
46,"asked the fox, putting her tail to her eyes, but peeping slily out of them all the same. ",3952,4041
47,"'I am dying of hunger,' answered the wolf, doggedly; ",4041,4094
48," 'and you know,' he added with a grin, 'that charity begins at home.' ",4093,4163
49,"'Quite so,' replied the fox; ",4163,4192
50, 'it would be unreasonable of me to object to your satisfying your appetite at my expense. ,4191,4282
51,"But if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice, the mother offers you one last request.' ",4282,4372
52,"'Then be quick and don't waste my time, for I can't wait much longer. ",4372,4442
53,What is it you want?' ,4442,4464
54,"'You must know,' said the fox, 'that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year, and keeps them in an old well, now dry, in his courtyard. ",4464,4666
55,"By the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used, in former days, to draw up water. ",4666,4755
56,"For many nights I have crept down to the palace, and have lowered myself in the bucket, bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children. ",4755,4901
57,"All I beg of you is to come with me, and, instead of hunting chickens and such things, I will make a good meal off cheese before I die.' ",4901,5038
58,'But the cheeses may be all finished by now?' ,5038,5084
59,'If you were only to see the quantities of them!' ,5084,5134
60,laughed the fox. ,5134,5151
61,"'And even if they were finished, there would always be ME to eat.' ",5151,5218
62,"'Well, I will come. ",5218,5238
63,"Lead the way, but I warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host-that is to say, without my legs, which are as long as yours!' ",5238,5410
64,"All was silent in the village, and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon, which shone bright and clear in the sky. ",5410,5535
65,"The wolf and the fox crept softly along, when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other; ",5535,5629
66," a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses, and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs, who began to bark greedily. ",5628,5754
67,"'Is it safe to go on, think you?' ",5754,5788
68,asked the wolf in a whisper. ,5788,5817
69,And the fox shook her head. ,5817,5845
70,"'Not while the dogs are barking,' said she; ",5845,5889
71, 'someone might come out to see if anything was the matter.' ,5888,5949
72,And she signed to the wolf to curl himself up in the shadow beside her. ,5949,6021
73,"In about half an hour the dogs grew tired of barking, or perhaps the bacon was eaten up and there was no smell to excite them. ",6021,6148
74,"Then the wolf and the fox jumped up, and hastened to the foot of the wall. ",6148,6223
75,"'I am lighter than he is,' thought the fox to herself, 'and perhaps if I make haste I can get a start, and jump over the wall on the other side before he manages to spring over this one.' ",6223,6411
76,And she quickened her pace. ,6411,6439
77,"But if the wolf could not run he could jump, and with one bound he was beside his companion. ",6439,6532
78,"'What were you going to do, comrade?' ",6532,6570
79,"'Oh, nothing,' replied the fox, much vexed at the failure of her plan. ",6570,6641
80,"'I think if I were to take a bit out of your haunch you would jump better,' said the wolf, giving a snap at her as he spoke. ",6641,6766
81,The fox drew back uneasily. ,6766,6794
82,"'Be careful, or I shall scream,' she snarled. ",6794,6840
83,"And the wolf, understanding all that might happen if the fox carried out her threat, gave a signal to his companion to leap on the wall, where he immediately followed her. ",6840,7012
84,Once on the top they crouched down and looked about them. ,7012,7070
85,"Not a creature was to be seen in the courtyard, and in the furthest corner from the house stood the well, with its two buckets suspended from a pole, just as the fox had described it. ",7070,7254
86,"The two thieves dragged themselves noiselessly along the wall till they were opposite the well, and by stretching out her neck as far as it would go the fox was able to make out that there was only very little water in the bottom, but just enough to reflect the moon, big, and round and yellow. ",7254,7549
87,'How lucky!' ,7549,7562
88,cried she to the wolf. ,7562,7585
89,'There is a huge cheese about the size of a mill wheel. ,7585,7641
90,Look! ,7641,7647
91,look! ,7647,7653
92,did you ever see anything so beautiful!' ,7653,7694
93,'Never!' ,7694,7703
94,"answered the wolf, peering over in his turn, his eyes glistening greedily, for he imagined that the moon's reflection in the water was really a cheese. ",7703,7855
95,"'And now, unbeliever, what have you to say?' ",7855,7900
96,and the fox laughed gently. ,7900,7928
97,"'That you are a woman-I mean a fox-of your word,' replied the wolf. ",7928,7996
98,"'Well, then, go down in that bucket and eat your fill,' said the fox. ",7996,8066
99,"'Oh, is that your game?' ",8066,8091
100,"asked the wolf, with a grin. ",8091,8120
101,'No! ,8120,8125
102,no! ,8125,8129
103,The person who goes down in the bucket will be you! ,8129,8181
104,And if you don't go down your head will go without you!' ,8181,8238
105,"'Of course I will go down, with the greatest pleasure,' answered the fox, who had expected the wolf's reply. ",8238,8347
106,"'And be sure you don't eat all the cheese, or it will be the worse for you,' continued the wolf. ",8347,8444
107,But the fox looked up at him with tears in her eyes. ,8444,8497
108,"'Farewell, suspicious one!' ",8497,8525
109,she said sadly. ,8525,8541
110,And climbed into the bucket. ,8541,8570
111,"In an instant she had reached the bottom of the well, and found that the water was not deep enough to cover her legs. ",8570,8688
112,"'Why, it is larger and richer than I thought,' cried she, turning towards the wolf, who was leaning over the wall of the well. ",8688,8815
113,"'Then be quick and bring it up,' commanded the wolf. ",8815,8868
114,"'How can I, when it weighs more than I do?' ",8868,8912
115,asked the fox. ,8912,8927
116,"'If it is so heavy bring it in two bits, of course,' said he. ",8927,8989
117,"'But I have no knife,' answered the fox. ",8989,9030
118,"'You will have to come down yourself, and we will carry it up between us.' ",9030,9105
119,'And how am I to come down?' ,9105,9134
120,inquired the wolf. ,9134,9153
121,"'Oh, you are really very stupid! ",9153,9186
122,Get into the other bucket that is nearly over your head.' ,9186,9244
123,"The wolf looked up, and saw the bucket hanging there, and with some difficulty he climbed into it. ",9244,9343
124,"As he weighed at least four times as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk, and the other bucket, in which the fox was seated, came to the surface. ",9343,9502
125,"As soon as he understood what was happening, the wolf began to speak like an angry wolf, but was a little comforted when he remembered that the cheese still remained to him. ",9502,9676
126,'But where is the cheese?' ,9676,9703
127,"he asked of the fox, who in her turn was leaning over the parapet watching his proceedings with a smile. ",9703,9808
128,'The cheese?' ,9808,9822
129,answered the fox; ,9822,9840
130," 'why I am taking it home to my babies, who are too young to get food for themselves.' ",9839,9926
131,"'Ah, traitor!' ",9926,9941
132,"cried the wolf, howling with rage. ",9941,9976
133,"But the fox was not there to hear this insult, for she had gone off to a neighbouring fowl-house, where she had noticed some fat young chickens the day before. ",9976,10136
134,"'Perhaps I did treat him rather badly,' she said to herself. ",10136,10197
135,"'But it seems getting cloudy, and if there should be heavy rain the other bucket will fill and sink to the bottom, and his will go up-at least it may!'",10197,10349
