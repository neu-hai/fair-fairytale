0,"ONCE upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. ",0,96
1,"She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief! ",96,196
2,On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard. ,196,256
3,"She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom. ",256,315
4,"Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. ",315,388
5,"She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. ",388,516
6,"She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere. ",516,605
7,"It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. ",605,663
8,"Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. ",663,798
9,"Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night--especially cheese and bacon. ",798,925
10,"Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully. ",925,993
11,"While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief. ",993,1079
12,"The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out. ",1079,1150
13,They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire. ,1150,1230
14,"They patted it with their little soft paws--""Shall we make dear little muffins?"" ",1230,1311
15,said Mittens to Moppet. ,1311,1335
16,"But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright. ",1335,1448
17,"Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand. ",1448,1549
18,"The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; ",1549,1589
19, she had called to borrow some yeast. ,1588,1626
20,"Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--""Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down! ",1626,1724
21,"I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,"" said Tabitha, shedding tears. ",1724,1789
22,"""I've lost my dear son Thomas; ",1789,1820
23," I'm afraid the rats have got him."" ",1819,1855
24,She wiped her eyes with an apron. ,1855,1889
25,"""He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; ",1889,1925
26, he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. ,1924,1991
27,"Where have you looked for him?"" ",1991,2023
28,"""All over the house! ",2023,2044
29,The rats are too many for me. ,2044,2074
30,"What a thing it is to have an unruly family!"" ",2074,2120
31,said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit. ,2120,2148
32,"""I'm not afraid of rats; ",2148,2173
33, I will help you to find him; ,2172,2202
34, and whip him too! ,2201,2220
35,"What is all that soot in the fender?"" ",2220,2258
36,"""The chimney wants sweeping--Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!"" ",2258,2348
37,"""They have both got out of the cup-board!"" ",2348,2391
38,Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. ,2391,2459
39,"They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards. ",2459,2540
40,"They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. ",2540,2624
41,"They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs. ",2624,2721
42,"""Yes, it is infested with rats,"" said Tabitha tearfully, ""I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. ",2721,2884
43,"And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat, Cousin Ribby. ",2884,2954
44,"I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole."" ",2954,3055
45,"""The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,"" said Tabitha. ",3055,3114
46,Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. ,3114,3155
47,They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor. ,3155,3220
48,But there was nothing to be seen. ,3220,3254
49,They returned to the kitchen. ,3254,3284
50,"""Here's one of your kittens at least,"" said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel. ",3284,3376
51,They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. ,3376,3444
52,She seemed to be in a terrible fright. ,3444,3483
53,"""Oh! ",3483,3488
54,"Mother, Mother,"" said Moppet, ""there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!"" ",3488,3602
55,The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. ,3602,3645
56,"Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone! ",3645,3734
57,"""Which way did she go, Moppet?"" ",3734,3766
58,But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again. ,3766,3839
59,"Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search. ",3839,3943
60,They went into the dairy. ,3943,3969
61,"The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar. ",3969,4033
62,"They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out. ",4033,4080
63,"""Oh, Mother, Mother!"" ",4080,4102
64,"said Mittens-- ""Oh! ",4102,4122
65,"Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a dreadful enormous big rat, Mother; ",4122,4219
66," and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin."" ",4218,4273
67,Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another. ,4273,4314
68,"""A rolling-pin and butter! ",4314,4341
69,"Oh, my poor son Thomas!"" ",4341,4366
70,"exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws. ",4366,4404
71,"""A rolling-pin?"" ",4404,4421
72,said Ribby. ,4421,4433
73,"""Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?"" ",4433,4520
74,Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. ,4520,4561
75,Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor. ,4561,4652
76,"""This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,"" said Ribby. ",4652,4699
77,"""We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw."" ",4699,4751
78,"Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats. ",4751,4950
79,Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. ,4950,5003
80,"When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide. ",5003,5073
81,"He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney. ",5073,5149
82,"The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; ",5149,5206
83, but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. ,5205,5263
84,Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up. ,5263,5309
85,It was a big old-fashioned fireplace. ,5309,5347
86,The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. ,5347,5427
87,So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat. ,5427,5477
88,"He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs. ",5477,5576
89,"Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender. ",5576,5713
90,Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; ,5713,5759
91, he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below. ,5758,5843
92,"He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows. ",5843,5944
93,"""I cannot go back. ",5944,5963
94,"If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket."" ",5963,6057
95,The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. ,6057,6103
96,It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth. ,6103,6176
97,"The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain. ",6176,6337
98,Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! ,6337,6377
99,"He climbed up, and up, and up. ",6377,6408
100,Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. ,6408,6455
101,He was like a little sweep himself. ,6455,6491
102,It was most confusing in the dark. ,6491,6526
103,One flue seemed to lead into another. ,6526,6564
104,"There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost. ",6564,6618
105,He scrambled up and up; ,6618,6642
106, but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. ,6641,6748
107,"There were some mutton bones lying about-- ""This seems funny,"" said Tom Kitten. ",6748,6828
108,"""Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? ",6828,6880
109,I wish I had never come! ,6880,6905
110,And what a funny smell! ,6905,6929
111,It is something like mouse; ,6929,6957
112, only dreadfully strong. ,6956,6981
113,"It makes me sneeze,"" said Tom Kitten. ",6981,7019
114,"He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light. ",7019,7158
115,He groped his way carefully for several yards; ,7158,7205
116," he was at the back of the skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture. ",7204,7307
117,"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags. ",7307,7410
118,"When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him--he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house. ",7410,7574
119,"It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster. ",7574,7674
120,Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat. ,7674,7741
121,"""What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?"" ",7741,7808
122,"said the rat, chattering his teeth. ",7808,7844
123,"""Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,"" said poor Tom Kitten. ",7844,7908
124,"""Anna Maria! ",7908,7921
125,"Anna Maria!"" ",7921,7934
126,squeaked the rat. ,7934,7952
127,There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter. ,7952,8032
128,"All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening-- His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots. ",8032,8216
129,Anna Maria did the tying. ,8216,8242
130,The old rat watched her and took snuff. ,8242,8282
131,"When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open. ",8282,8358
132,"""Anna Maria,"" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers),--""Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner."" ",8358,8501
133,"""It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,"" said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side. ",8501,8628
134,"""No,"" said Samuel Whiskers, ""make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs."" ",8628,8706
135,"""Nonsense! ",8706,8717
136,"Butter and dough,"" replied Anna Maria. ",8717,8756
137,The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away. ,8756,8826
138,"Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. ",8826,8951
139,He did not meet anybody. ,8951,8976
140,He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. ,8976,9022
141,"He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel. ",9022,9106
142,"He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest. ",9106,9210
143,They did not see him. ,9210,9232
144,Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough. ,9232,9338
145,"She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws. ",9338,9407
146,She did not observe Moppet. ,9407,9435
147,"While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help. ",9435,9542
148,"But his mouth was full of soot and cob-webs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him. ",9542,9668
149,"Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance. ",9668,9783
150,It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles. ,9783,9868
151,It did not offer to assist him. ,9868,9900
152,Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted. ,9900,9963
153,Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling. ,9963,10037
154,"First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough. ",10037,10112
155,"""Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?"" ",10112,10168
156,inquired Samuel Whiskers. ,10168,10194
157,Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; ,10194,10253
158," but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry. ",10252,10341
159,She laid hold of his ears. ,10341,10368
160,"Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; ",10368,10417
161," and the rolling-pin went roly-poly, roly; ",10416,10459
162," roly, poly, roly. ",10458,10477
163,The rats each held an end. ,10477,10504
164,"""His tail is sticking out! ",10504,10531
165,"You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria."" ",10531,10576
166,"""I fetched as much as I could carry,"" replied Anna Maria. ",10576,10634
167,"""I do not think""--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--""I do NOT think it will be a good pudding. ",10634,10755
168,"It smells sooty."" ",10755,10773
169,"Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; ",10773,10900
170," and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping! ",10899,10955
171,"The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively. ",10955,11015
172,"""We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; ",11015,11063
173," let us collect our property,--and other people's,--and depart at once."" ",11062,11135
174,"""I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding."" ",11135,11192
175,"""But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary."" ",11192,11299
176,"""Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,"" said Anna Maria. ",11299,11394
177,"""I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney."" ",11394,11448
178,So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up--there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling! ,11448,11611
179,But there was a strong smell of rats; ,11611,11649
180," and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet. ",11648,11806
181,"Then he nailed the plank down again, and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs. ",11806,11894
182,The cat family had quite recovered. ,11894,11930
183,They invited him to stay to dinner. ,11930,11966
184,"The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts. ",11966,12090
185,They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off. ,12090,12169
186,John Joiner smelt the pudding; ,12169,12200
187," but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops. ",12199,12360
188,"And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like mine. ",12360,12581
189,They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes. ,12581,12651
190,Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. ,12651,12698
191,Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones. ,12698,12744
192,"She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage. ",12744,12818
193,I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow! ,12818,12880
194,"They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow. ",12880,12977
195,"After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's. ",12977,13052
196,"As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. ",13052,13114
197,"There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! ",13114,13162
198,"They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags. ",13162,13254
199,And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers--children and grand-children and great great grand-children. ,13254,13376
200,There is no end to them! ,13376,13401
201,Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers. ,13401,13463
202,"They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment. ",13463,13540
203,"They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very comfortably. ",13540,13609
204,"They hang up the rats' tails in a row or the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them. ",13609,13727
205,But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; ,13727,13775
206, he never durst face anything that is bigger than-- A Mouse.,13774,13835
