0,The wild people who dwell in the South-West are masters of many black arts. ,0,76
1,"They often lure men of the Middle Kingdom to their country by promising them their daughters in marriage, but their promises are not to be trusted. ",76,224
2,"Once there was the son of a poor family, who agreed to labor for three years for one of the wild men in order to become his son-in-law. ",224,360
3,"At the end of that time the wedding was celebrated, and the couple were given a little house for a home. ",360,465
4,"But no sooner had they entered it than the wife warned her husband to be on his guard, since her parents did not like him, and would seek to do him harm. ",465,619
5,"In accordance with the custom she entered the house first with a lighted lantern, but when the bridegroom followed her she had disappeared. ",619,759
6,"And thus it went, day by day. ",759,789
7,"During the daytime she was there, but when evening came she disappeared. ",789,862
8,"And one day, not long after they had been married, his wife said to him: ""To-morrow morning my mother celebrates her birthday, and you must go to congratulate her. ",862,1026
9,They will offer you tea and food. ,1026,1060
10,"The tea you may drink, but be sure not to touch any of the food. ",1060,1125
11,"Keep this in mind!"" ",1125,1145
12,So the following day the wife and husband went to her mother's home and offered their congratulations. ,1145,1248
13,"Her parents seemed highly pleased, and served them with tea and sweets. ",1248,1320
14,"The son-in-law drank, but ate nothing, though his wife's parents, with kind words and friendly gestures, kept urging him to help himself. ",1320,1458
15,"At last the son-in-law did not know what to do, and thought that surely they could mean him no ill. And seeing the fresh caught eels and crabs on the plate before him, he ate a little of them. ",1458,1651
16,"His wife gave him a reproachful glance, and he offered some excuse for taking his leave. ",1651,1740
17,"But his mother-in-law said: ""This is my birthday. ",1740,1790
18,"You simply must taste my birthday noodles!"" ",1790,1834
19,"With that she placed a great dish before him, filled with noodles that looked like threads of silver, mingled with fat meat, and spiced with fragrant mushrooms. ",1834,1995
20,During all the time he had been living in the country the son-in-law had never yet seen such an appetizing dish. ,1995,2108
21,"Its pleasant odor rose temptingly to his nostrils, and he could not resist raising his chop-sticks. ",2108,2208
22,"His wife glanced over at him, but he pretended that he did not see her. ",2208,2280
23,"She coughed significantly, but he acted as though he did not hear. ",2280,2347
24,Finally she trod on his foot under the table; ,2347,2393
25, and then he regained control of himself. ,2392,2434
26,"He had not as yet eaten half of the food and said: ""My hunger is satisfied."" ",2434,2511
27,"Then he took leave, and went off with his wife. ",2511,2559
28,"""This is a serious matter,"" said the latter. ",2559,2604
29,"""You would not listen to my words, and now you will surely have to die!"" ",2604,2677
30,"But still he did not believe her, until he suddenly felt terrible pains, which soon grew unbearable, so that he fell to the ground unconscious. ",2677,2821
31,"His wife at once hung him up by the feet from the beam of the roof, and put a panful of glowing charcoal under his body, and a great jar of water, into which she had poured sesame oil, in front of the fire, directly below his mouth. ",2821,3054
32,"And when the fire had heated him thoroughly, he suddenly opened his mouth-and can you imagine what came out of it? ",3054,3169
33,"A squirming, crawling mass of poisonous worms, centipedes, toads and tadpoles, who all fell into the jar of water. ",3169,3284
34,"Then his wife untied him, carried him to bed, and gave him wine mingled with realgar to drink. ",3284,3379
35,Then he recovered. ,3379,3398
36,"""What you ate in the belief that they were eels and crabs,"" said his wife, ""were nothing but toads and tadpoles, and the birthday noodles were poisonous worms and centipedes. ",3398,3573
37,But you must continue to be careful. ,3573,3610
38,"My parents know that you have not died, and they will think up other evil plans."" ",3610,3692
39,"A few days later his father-in-law said to him: ""There is a large tree growing on the precipice which juts over the cave. ",3692,3814
40,In it is the nest of the phenix. ,3814,3847
41,"You are still young and able to climb, so go there quickly and fetch me the eggs!"" ",3847,3930
42,His son-in-law went home and told his wife. ,3930,3974
43,"""Take long bamboo poles,"" said she, ""and tie them together, and fasten a curved sword at the top. ",3974,4072
44,"And take these nine loaves of bread and these hens' eggs, there are seven times seven of them. ",4072,4167
45,Carry them along with you in a basket. ,4167,4206
46,When you come to the spot you will see a large nest up in the branches. ,4206,4278
47,"Do not climb the tree, but chop it down with the curved sword. ",4278,4341
48,"Then throw away your poles, and run for dear life. ",4341,4392
49,"Should a monster appear and follow you, throw him the loaves of bread, three loaves at a time, and finally throw down the eggs on the ground and make for home as quickly as you can. ",4392,4574
50,"In this way you may escape the danger which threatens you."" ",4574,4634
51,The man noted all she said exactly and went. ,4634,4679
52,And sure enough he saw the bird's nest-it was as large as a round pavilion. ,4679,4755
53,"Then he tied his curved sword to the poles, chopped at the tree with all his strength, laid down his poles on the ground and never looked around but ran for dear life. ",4755,4923
54,Suddenly he heard the roaring of a thunder-storm rising above him. ,4923,4990
55,"When he looked up he saw a great dragon, many fathoms long and some ten feet across. ",4990,5075
56,His eyes gleamed like two lamps and he was spitting fire and flame from his maw. ,5075,5156
57,He had stretched out two feelers and was feeling along the ground. ,5156,5223
58,Then the man swiftly flung the loaves into the air. ,5223,5275
59,"The dragon caught them, and it took a little time before he had devoured them. ",5275,5354
60,But no sooner had the man gained a few steps than the dragon once more came flying after him. ,5354,5448
61,"Then he flung him more loaves and when the loaves came to an end, he turned over his basket so that the eggs rolled over the ground. ",5448,5581
62,The dragon had not yet satisfied his hunger and opened his greedy jaws wide. ,5581,5658
63,"When he suddenly caught sight of the eggs, he descended from the air, and since the eggs were scattered round about, it took some time before he had sucked them all. ",5658,5824
64,In the meantime the man succeeded in escaping to his home. ,5824,5883
65,"When he entered the door and saw his wife, he said to her, amid sobs: ""It was all I could do to escape, and I am lucky not to be in the dragon's stomach! ",5883,6037
66,"If this sort of thing keeps up much longer I am bound to die!"" ",6037,6100
67,With these words he kneeled and begged his wife pitifully to save his life. ,6100,6176
68,"""Where is your home?"" ",6176,6198
69,asked his wife. ,6198,6214
70,"""My home is about a hundred miles away from here, in the Middle Kingdom, and my old mother is still living. ",6214,6322
71,"The only thing that worries me is that we are so poor."" ",6322,6378
72,"His wife said: ""I will flee with you, and we will find your mother. ",6378,6446
73,"And waste no regrets on your poverty."" ",6446,6485
74,"With that she gathered up all the house held in the way of pearls and precious stones, put them in a bag and had her husband tie it around his waist. ",6485,6635
75,"Then she also gave him an umbrella, and in the middle of the night they climbed the wall with the aid of a ladder, and stole away. ",6635,6766
76,"His wife had also said to him: ""Take the umbrella on your back and run as fast as ever you can! ",6766,6862
77,"Do not open it, and do not look around! ",6862,6902
78,"I will follow you in secret."" ",6902,6932
79,So he turned North and ran with all his might and main. ,6932,6988
80,"He had been running for a day and a night, had covered nearly a hundred miles, and passed the boundaries of the wild people's country, when his legs gave out and he grew hungry. ",6988,7166
81,Before him lay a mountain village. ,7166,7201
82,"He stopped at the village gate to rest, drew some food from his pocket and began to eat. ",7201,7290
83,And he looked around without being able to see his wife. ,7290,7347
84,"Said he to himself: ""Perhaps she has deceived me after all, and is not coming with me!"" ",7347,7435
85,"After he had finished eating, he took a drink from a spring, and painfully dragged himself further. ",7435,7535
86,When the heat of the day was greatest a violent mountain rain suddenly began to fall. ,7535,7621
87,In his haste he forgot what his wife had told him and opened his umbrella. ,7621,7696
88,And out fell his wife upon the ground. ,7696,7735
89,"She reproached him: ""Once more you have not listened to my advice. ",7735,7802
90,"Now the damage has been done!"" ",7802,7833
91,"Quickly she told him to go to the village, and there to buy a white cock, seven black tea-cups, and half a length of red nettlecloth. ",7833,7967
92,"""Do not be sparing of the silver pieces in your pocket!"" ",7967,8024
93,she cried after him as he went off. ,8024,8060
94,"He went to the village, attended to everything, and came back. ",8060,8123
95,"The woman tore the cloth apart, made a coat of it and put it on. ",8123,8188
96,"No sooner had they walked a few miles before they could see a red cloud rising up in the South, like a flying bird. ",8188,8304
97,"""That is my mother,"" said the woman. ",8304,8341
98,In a moment the cloud was overhead. ,8341,8377
99,Then the woman took the black tea-cups and threw them at it. ,8377,8438
100,Seven she threw and seven fell to earth again. ,8438,8485
101,"And then they could hear the mother in the cloud weeping and scolding, and thereupon the cloud disappeared. ",8485,8593
102,They went on for about four hours. ,8593,8628
103,"Then they heard a sound like the noise of silk being torn, and could see a cloud as black as ink, which was rushing up against the wind. ",8628,8765
104,"""Alas, that is my father!"" ",8765,8792
105,said the woman. ,8325,8341
106,"""This is a matter of life and death, for he will not let us be! ",8808,8872
107,"Because of my love for you I will now have to disobey the holiest of laws!"" ",8872,8948
108,"With these words she quickly seized the white cock, separated its head from its body, and flung the head into the air. ",8948,9067
109,"At once the black cloud dissolved, and her father's body, the head severed from the trunk, fell down by the edge of the road. ",9067,9193
110,"Then the woman wept bitterly, and when she had wept her fill they buried the corpse. ",9193,9278
111,"Thereupon they went together to her husband's home, where they found his old mother still living. ",9278,9376
112,"They then undid the bag of pearls and jewels, bought a piece of good ground, built a fine house, and became wealthy and respected members of the community.",9376,9532
