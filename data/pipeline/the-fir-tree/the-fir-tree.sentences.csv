0,There was once a pretty little fir-tree in a wood. ,0,51
1,"It was in a capital position, for it could get sun, and there was enough air, and all around grew many tall companions, both pines and firs. ",51,192
2,"It did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air, or notice the little peasant children who ran about chattering when they came out to gather wild strawberries and raspberries. ",192,367
3,Often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw; ,367,438
4," they would sit down by the little fir-tree and say, 'What a pretty little one this is!' ",437,526
5,The tree did not like that at all. ,526,561
6,"By the next year it had grown a whole ring taller, and the year after that another ring more, for you can always tell a fir-tree's age from its rings. ",561,712
7,'Oh! ,712,717
8,if I were only a great tree like the others!' ,717,763
9,"sighed the little fir-tree, 'then I could stretch out my branches far and wide and look out into the great world! ",763,877
10,"The birds would build their nests in my branches, and when the wind blew I would bow to it politely just like the others!' ",877,1000
11,"It took no pleasure in the sunshine, nor in the birds, nor in the rose-coloured clouds that sailed over it at dawn and at sunset. ",1000,1130
12,"Then the winter came, and the snow lay white and sparkling all around, and a hare would come and spring right over the little fir-tree, which annoyed it very much. ",1130,1294
13,But when two more winters had passed the fir-tree was so tall that the hare had to run round it. ,1294,1391
14,'Ah! ,1391,1396
15,"to grow and grow, and become great and old! ",1396,1440
16,"that is the only pleasure in life,' thought the tree. ",1440,1494
17,In the autumn the woodcutters used to come and hew some of the tallest trees; ,1494,1572
18," this happened every year, and the young fir-tree would shiver as the magnificent trees fell crashing and crackling to the ground, their branches hewn off, and the great trunks left bare, so that they were almost unrecognisable. ",1571,1800
19,But then they were laid on waggons and dragged out of the wood by horses. ,1800,1874
20,'Where are they going? ,1874,1897
21,What will happen to them?' ,1897,1924
22,"In spring, when the swallows and storks came, the fir-tree asked them, 'Do you know where they were taken? ",1924,2031
23,Have you met them?' ,2031,2051
24,"The swallows knew nothing of them, but the stork nodded his head thoughtfully, saying, 'I think I know. ",2051,2155
25,I met many new ships as I flew from Egypt; ,2155,2198
26, there were splendid masts on the ships. ,2197,2238
27,I'll wager those were they! ,2238,2266
28,They had the scent of fir-trees. ,2266,2299
29,Ah! ,1392,1396
30,"those are grand, grand!' ",2303,2328
31,'Oh! ,712,717
32,if I were only big enough to sail away over the sea too! ,2333,2390
33,What sort of thing is the sea? ,2390,2421
34,what does it look like?' ,2421,2446
35,'Oh! ,712,717
36,"it would take much too long to tell you all that,' said the stork, and off he went. ",2451,2535
37,"'Rejoice in your youth,' said the sunbeams, 'rejoice in the sweet growing time, in the young life within you.' ",2535,2646
38,"And the wind kissed it and the dew wept tears over it, but the fir-tree did not understand. ",2646,2738
39,"Towards Christmas-time quite little trees were cut down, some not as big as the young fir-tree, or just the same age, and now it had no peace or rest for longing to be away. ",2738,2912
40,"These little trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept all their branches; ",2912,2993
41, they were put in carts and drawn out of the wood by horses. ,2992,3053
42,'Whither are those going?' ,3053,3080
43,asked the fir-tree; ,3080,3100
44," 'they are no bigger than I, and one there was much smaller even! ",3099,3165
45,Why do they keep their branches? ,3165,3198
46,Where are they taken to?' ,3198,3224
47,'We know! ,3224,3234
48,we know!' ,3234,3244
49,twittered the sparrows. ,3244,3268
50,"'Down there in the city we have peeped in at the windows, we know where they go! ",3268,3349
51,They attain to the greatest splendour and magnificence you can imagine! ,3349,3421
52,"We have looked in at the windows and seen them planted in the middle of the warm room and adorned with the most beautiful things-golden apples, sweet-meats, toys and hundreds of candles.' ",3421,3609
53,'And then?' ,3609,3621
54,"asked the fir-tree, trembling in every limb with eagerness, 'and then? ",3621,3692
55,what happens then?' ,3692,3712
56,"'Oh, we haven't seen anything more than that. ",3712,3758
57,That was simply matchless!' ,3758,3786
58,'Am I too destined to the same brilliant career?' ,3786,3836
59,wondered the fir-tree excitedly. ,3836,3869
60,'That is even better than sailing over the sea! ,3869,3917
61,I am sick with longing. ,3917,3941
62,If it were only Christmas! ,3941,3968
63,Now I am tall and grown-up like those which were taken away last year. ,3968,4039
64,"Ah, if I were only in the cart! ",4039,4071
65,If I were only in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence! ,4071,4144
66,And then?',3610,3620
67,"Then comes something better, something still more beautiful, else why should they dress us up? ",4154,4249
68,"There must be something greater, something grander to come-but what? ",4249,4318
69,Oh! ,713,717
70,I am pining away! ,4322,4340
71,I really don't know what's the matter with me!' ,4340,4388
72,"'Rejoice in us,' said the air and sunshine, 'rejoice in your fresh youth in the free air!' ",4388,4479
73,"But it took no notice, and just grew and grew; ",4479,4526
74," there it stood fresh and green in winter and summer, and all who saw it said, 'What a beautiful tree!' ",4525,4629
75,And at Christmas-time it was the first to be cut down. ,4629,4684
76,The axe went deep into the pith; ,4684,4717
77, the tree fell to the ground with a groan; ,4716,4759
78, it felt bruised and faint. ,4758,4786
79,"It could not think of happiness, it was sad at leaving its home, the spot where it had sprung up; ",4786,4884
80," it knew, too, that it would never see again its dear old companions, or the little shrubs and flowers, perhaps not even the birds. ",4883,5015
81,Altogether the parting was not pleasant. ,5015,5056
82,"When the tree came to itself again it was packed in a yard with other trees, and a man was saying, 'This is a splendid one, we shall only want this.' ",5056,5206
83,Then came two footmen in livery and carried the fir-tree to a large and beautiful room. ,5206,5294
84,"There were pictures hanging on the walls, and near the Dutch stove stood great Chinese vases with lions on their lids; ",5294,5413
85," there were armchairs, silk-covered sofas, big tables laden with picture-books and toys, worth hundreds of pounds-at least, so the children said. ",5412,5558
86,"The fir-tree was placed in a great tub filled with sand, but no one could see that it was a tub, for it was all hung with greenery and stood on a gay carpet. ",5558,5716
87,How the tree trembled! ,5716,5739
88,What was coming now? ,5739,5760
89,"On its branches they hung little nets cut out of coloured paper, each full of sugarplums; ",5760,5850
90," gilt apples and nuts hung down as if they were growing, over a hundred red, blue, and white tapers were fastened among the branches. ",5849,5983
91,"Dolls as life-like as human beings-the fir-tree had never seen any before were suspended among the green, and right up at the top was fixed a gold tinsel star; ",5983,6143
92," it was gorgeous, quite unusually gorgeous! ",6142,6186
93,"'To-night,' they all said, 'to-night it will be lighted!' ",6186,6244
94,'Ah!' ,6244,6250
95,"thought the tree, 'if it were only evening! ",6250,6294
96,Then the tapers would soon be lighted. ,6294,6333
97,What will happen then? ,6333,6356
98,"I wonder whether the trees will come from the wood to see me, or if the sparrows will fly against the window panes? ",6356,6472
99,Am I to stand here decked out thus through winter and summer?' ,6472,6535
100,"It was not a bad guess, but the fir-tree had real bark-ache from sheer longing, and bark-ache in trees is just as bad as head-ache in human beings. ",6535,6683
101,Now the tapers were lighted. ,6683,6712
102,What a glitter! ,6712,6728
103,What splendour! ,6728,6744
104,"The tree quivered in all its branches so much, that one of the candles caught the green, and singed it. ",6744,6848
105,'Take care!' ,6848,6861
106,"cried the young ladies, and they extinguished it. ",6861,6911
107,Now the tree did not even dare to quiver. ,6911,6953
108,It was really terrible! ,6953,6977
109,"It was so afraid of losing any of its ornaments, and it was quite bewildered by all the radiance. ",6977,7075
110,"And then the folding doors were opened, and a crowd of children rushed in, as though they wanted to knock down the whole tree, whilst the older people followed soberly. ",7075,7244
111,"The children stood quite silent, but only for a moment, and then they shouted again, and danced round the tree, and snatched off one present after another. ",7244,7400
112,'What are they doing?' ,7400,7423
113,thought the tree. ,1476,1494
114,'What is going to happen?' ,7441,7468
115,"And the tapers burnt low on the branches, and were put out one by one, and then the children were given permission to plunder the tree. ",7468,7604
116,They rushed at it so that all its boughs creaked; ,7604,7654
117," if it had not been fastened by the gold star at the top to the ceiling, it would have been overthrown. ",7653,7757
118,"The children danced about with their splendid toys, and no one looked at the tree, except the old nurse, who came and peeped amongst the boughs, just to see if a fig or an apple had been forgotten. ",7757,7955
119,'A story! ,7955,7965
120,a story!' ,7965,7975
121,"cried the children, and dragged a little stout man to the tree; ",7975,8039
122," he sat down beneath it, saying, 'Here we are in the greenwood, and the tree will be delighted to listen! ",8038,8144
123,But I am only going to tell one story. ,8144,8183
124,"Shall it be Henny Penny or Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs, and yet gained great honour and married a princess?' ",8183,8298
125,'Henny Penny!' ,8298,8313
126,cried some; ,8313,8325
127, 'Humpty Dumpty!' ,8324,8342
128,cried others; ,8342,8356
129, there was a perfect babel of voices! ,8355,8393
130,"Only the fir-tree kept silent, and thought, 'Am I not to be in it? ",8393,8460
131,Am I to have nothing to do with it?' ,8460,8497
132,"But it had already been in it, and played out its part. ",8497,8553
133,And the man told them about Humpty Dumpty who fell downstairs and married a princess. ,8553,8639
134,"The children clapped their hands and cried, 'Another! ",8639,8693
135,another!' ,8693,8703
136,"They wanted the story of Henny Penny also, but they only got Humpty Dumpty. ",8703,8779
137,The fir-tree stood quite astonished and thoughtful; ,8779,8831
138, the birds in the wood had never related anything like that. ,8830,8891
139,'Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs and yet married a princess! ,8891,8950
140,"yes, that is the way of the world!' ",8950,8986
141,"thought the tree, and was sure it must be true, because such a nice man had told the story. ",8986,9078
142,"'Well, who knows? ",9078,9096
143,Perhaps I shall fall downstairs and marry a princess.' ,9096,9151
144,"And it rejoiced to think that next day it would be decked out again with candles, toys, glittering ornaments, and fruits. ",9151,9273
145,'To-morrow I shall quiver again with excitement. ,9273,9322
146,I shall enjoy to the full all my splendour. ,9322,9366
147,"To-morrow I shall hear Humpty Dumpty again, and perhaps Henny Penny too.' ",9366,9440
148,And the tree stood silent and lost in thought all through the night. ,9440,9509
149,Next morning the servants came in. ,9509,9544
150,"'Now the dressing up will begin again,' thought the tree. ",9544,9602
151,"But they dragged it out of the room, and up the stairs to the lumber-room, and put it in a dark corner, where no ray of light could penetrate. ",9602,9745
152,'What does this mean?' ,9745,9768
153,thought the tree. ,1476,1494
154,'What am I to do here? ,9786,9809
155,What is there for me to hear?' ,9809,9840
156,"And it leant against the wall, and thought and thought. ",9840,9896
157,"And there was time enough for that, for days and nights went by, and no one came; ",9896,9978
158," at last when some one did come, it was only to put some great boxes into the corner. ",9977,10063
159,Now the tree was quite covered; ,10063,10095
160, it seemed as if it had been quite forgotten. ,10094,10140
161,"'Now it is winter out-doors,' thought the fir-tree. ",10140,10192
162,"'The ground is hard and covered with snow, they can't plant me yet, and that is why I am staying here under cover till the spring comes. ",10192,10329
163,How thoughtful they are! ,10329,10354
164,Only I wish it were not so terribly dark and lonely here; ,10354,10412
165, not even a little hare! ,10411,10436
166,"It was so nice out in the wood, when the snow lay all around, and the hare leapt past me; ",10436,10526
167," yes, even when he leapt over me: but I didn't like it then. ",10525,10586
168,It's so dreadfully lonely up here.' ,10586,10622
169,"'Squeak, squeak!' ",10622,10640
170,"said a little mouse, stealing out, followed by a second. ",10640,10697
171,"They sniffed at the fir-tree, and then crept between its boughs. ",10697,10762
172,"'It's frightfully cold,' said the little mice. ",10762,10809
173,'How nice it is to be here! ,10809,10837
174,"Don't you think so too, you old fir-tree?' ",10837,10880
175,"'I'm not at all old,' said the tree; ",10880,10917
176, 'there are many much older than I am.' ,10916,10956
177,'Where do you come from?' ,10956,10982
178,"asked the mice, 'and what do you know?' ",10982,11022
179,They were extremely inquisitive. ,11022,11055
180,'Do tell us about the most beautiful place in the world. ,11055,11112
181,Is that where you come from? ,11112,11141
182,"Have you been in the storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling, where one dances on tallow candles, and where one goes in thin and comes out fat?' ",11141,11322
183,"'I know nothing about that,' said the tree. ",11322,11366
184,"'But I know the wood, where the sun shines, and the birds sing.' ",11366,11431
185,"And then it told them all about its young days, and the little mice had never heard anything like that before, and they listened with all their ears, and said: 'Oh, how much you have seen! ",11431,11620
186,How lucky you have been!' ,11620,11646
187,'I?' ,11646,11651
188,"said the fir-tree, and then it thought over what it had told them. ",11651,11718
189,"'Yes, on the whole those were very happy times.' ",11718,11767
190,"But then it went on to tell them about Christmas Eve, when it had been adorned with sweet-meats and tapers. ",11767,11875
191,'Oh!' ,11875,11881
192,"said the little mice, 'how lucky you have been, you old fir-tree!' ",11881,11948
193,'I'm not at all old' said the tree. ,11948,11984
194,'I only came from the wood this winter. ,11984,12024
195,"I am only a little backward, perhaps, in my growth.' ",12024,12077
196,'How beautifully you tell stories!' ,12077,12113
197,said the little mice. ,10787,10809
198,"And next evening they came with four others, who wanted to hear the tree's story, and it told still more, for it remembered everything so clearly and thought: 'Those were happy times! ",12135,12319
199,But they may come again. ,12319,12344
200,"Humpty dumpty fell downstairs, and yet he married a princess; ",12344,12406
201, perhaps I shall also marry a princess!' ,12405,12446
202,"And then it thought of a pretty little birch-tree that grew out in the wood, and seemed to the fir-tree a real princess, and a very beautiful one too. ",12446,12597
203,'Who is Humpty Dumpty?' ,12597,12621
204,asked the little mice. ,12621,12644
205,And then the tree told the whole story; ,12644,12684
206," it could remember every single word, and the little mice were ready to leap on to the topmost branch out of sheer joy! ",12683,12803
207,"Next night many more mice came, and on Sunday even two rats; ",12803,12864
208," but they did not care about the story, and that troubled the little mice, for now they thought less of it too. ",12863,12975
209,'Is that the only story you know?' ,12975,13010
210,asked the rats. ,13010,13026
211,"'The only one,' answered the tree. ",13026,13061
212,"'I heard that on my happiest evening, but I did not realise then how happy I was.' ",13061,13144
213,'That's a very poor story. ,13144,13171
214,Don't you know one about bacon or tallow candles? ,13171,13221
215,a storeroom story?' ,13221,13241
216,"'No,' said the tree. ",13241,13262
217,"'Then we are much obliged to you,' said the rats, and they went back to their friends. ",13262,13349
218,"At last the little mice went off also, and the tree said, sighing: 'Really it was very pleasant when the lively little mice sat round and listened whilst I told them stories. ",13349,13524
219,But now that's over too. ,13524,13549
220,"But now I will think of the time when I shall be brought out again, to keep up my spirits.' ",13549,13641
221,But when did that happen? ,13641,13667
222,"Well, it was one morning when they came to tidy up the lumber-room; ",13667,13735
223," they threw it really rather roughly on the floor, but a servant dragged it off at once downstairs, where there was daylight once more. ",13734,13870
224,'Now life begins again!' ,13870,13895
225,thought the tree. ,1476,1494
226,"It felt the fresh air, the first rays of the sun, and there it was out in the yard! ",13913,13997
227,Everything passed so quickly; ,13997,14027
228," the tree quite forgot to notice itself, there was so much to look at all around. ",14026,14108
229,The yard opened on a garden full of flowers; ,14108,14153
230," the roses were so fresh and sweet, hanging over a little trellis, the lime-trees were in blossom, and the swallows flew about, saying: 'Quirre-virre-vil, my husband has come home;'",14152,14333
231,' but it was not the fir-tree they meant. ,14332,14374
232,"'Now I shall live,' thought the tree joyfully, stretching out its branches wide; ",14374,14455
233," but, alas! ",14454,14466
234,they were all withered and yellow; ,14466,14501
235, and it was lying in a corner among weeds and nettles. ,14500,14555
236,"The golden star was still on its highest bough, and it glittered in the bright sunlight. ",14555,14644
237,"In the yard some of the merry children were playing, who had danced so gaily round the tree at Christmas. ",14644,14750
238,"One of the little ones ran up, and tore off the gold star. ",14750,14809
239,'Look what was left on the ugly old fir-tree!' ,14809,14856
240,"he cried, and stamped on the boughs so that they cracked under his feet. ",14856,14929
241,"And the tree looked at all the splendour and freshness of the flowers in the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished that it had been left lying in the dark corner of the lumber-room; ",14929,15119
242," it thought of its fresh youth in the wood, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the little mice who had listened so happily to the story of Humpty Dumpty. ",15118,15272
243,'Too late! ,15272,15283
244,Too late!' ,15283,15294
245,thought the old tree. ,15294,15316
246,'If only I had enjoyed myself whilst I could. ,15316,15362
247,Now all is over and gone.' ,15362,15389
248,"And a servant came and cut the tree into small pieces, there was quite a bundle of them; ",15389,15478
249, they flickered brightly under the great copper in the brew-house; ,15477,15544
250," the tree sighed deeply, and each sigh was like a pistol-shot; ",15543,15606
251," so the children who were playing there ran up, and sat in front of the fire, gazing at it, and crying, 'Piff! ",15605,15716
252,puff! ,15716,15722
253,bang!' ,15722,15729
254,"But for each report, which was really a sigh, the tree was thinking of a summer's day in the wood, or of a winter's night out there, when the stars were shining; ",15729,15891
255," it thought of Christmas Eve, and of Humpty Dumpty, which was the only story it had heard, or could tell, and then the tree had burnt away. ",15890,16030
