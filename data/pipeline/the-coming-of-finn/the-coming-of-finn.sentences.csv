0,"It was the Eve of Samhain, which we Christians call All Hallows' Eve. ",0,70
1,"The King of Ireland, Conn, the Hundred-Fighter, sat at supper in his palace at Tara. ",70,155
2,All his chiefs and mighty men were with him. ,155,200
3,"On his right hand was his only son, Art the Solitary, so called because he had no brothers. ",200,292
4,"The sons of Morna, who kept the boy Finn out of his rights and were at the time trying to kill him if they could, were here too. ",292,421
5,"Chief amongst them was Gaul mac Morna, a huge and strong warrior, and Captain of all the Fians ever since that battle in which Finn's father had been killed. ",421,579
6,And Gaul's men were with him. ,579,609
7,The great long table was spread for supper. ,609,653
8,"A thousand wax candles shed their light through the chamber, and caused the vessels of gold, silver, and bronze to shine. ",653,775
9,"Yet, though it was a great feast, none of these warriors seemed to care about eating or drinking; ",775,873
10," every face was sad, and there was little conversation, and no music. ",872,942
11,It seemed as if they were expecting some calamity. ,942,993
12,"Conn's sceptre, which was a plain staff of silver, lay beside him on the table, and there was a canopy of bright bronze over his head. ",993,1128
13,"Gaul mac Morna, Captain of the Fians, sat at the other end of the long table. ",1128,1206
14,"Every warrior wore a bright banqueting mantle of silk or satin, scarlet or crimson, blue, green, or purple, fastened on the breast either with a great brooch or with a pin of gold or silver. ",1206,1397
15,"Yet, though their raiment was bright and gay, and though all the usual instruments of festivity were there, and a thousand tall candles shed their light over the scene, no one looked happy. ",1397,1587
16,"Then was heard a low sound like thunder, and the earth seemed to tremble, and after that they distinctly heard a footfall like the slow, deliberate tread of a giant. ",1587,1753
17,"These footfalls sent a chill into every heart, and every face, gloomy before, was now pale. ",1753,1845
18,"The King leaned past his son Art the Solitary, and said to a certain Druid who sat beside Art, ""Is this the son of Midna come before his time?"" ",1845,1989
19,"""It is not,"" said the Druid, ""but it is the man who is to conquer Midna. ",1989,2062
20,"One is coming to Tara this night before whose glory all other glory shall wax dim."" ",2062,2146
21,"Shortly after that they heard the voices of the doorkeepers raised in contention, as if they would repel from the hall someone who wished to enter, then a slight scuffle, and after that a strange figure entered the chamber. ",2146,2370
22,"He was dressed in the skins of wild beasts, and wore over his shoulders a huge thick cloak of wild boars' skins, fastened on the breast with a white tusk of the same animal. ",2370,2544
23,He wore a shield and two spears. ,2544,2577
24,"Though of huge stature his face was that of a boy, smooth on the cheeks and lips. ",2577,2659
25,"It was white and ruddy, and very handsome. ",2659,2702
26,His hair was like refined gold. ,2702,2734
27,"A light seemed to go out from him, before which the candles burned dim. ",2734,2806
28,It was Finn. ,2806,2819
29,"He stood in the doorway, and cried out in a strong and sonorous, but musical, voice: ""O Conn the Hundred-Fighter, son of Felimy, the righteous son of Tuthal the legitimate, O King of the Kings of Erin, a wronged and disinherited youth, possessing nowhere one rood of his patrimony, a wanderer and an outlaw, a hunter of the wildernesses and mountains, claims hospitality of thee, illustrious prince, on the eve of the great festival of Samhain."" ",2819,3265
30,"""Thou art welcome whoever thou art,"" answered the King, ""and doubly welcome because thou art unfortunate. ",3265,3371
31,"I think, such is thy face and form, that thou art the son of some mighty king on whom disaster has fallen undeserved. ",3371,3489
32,The high gods of Erin grant thee speedy restoration and strong vengeance of thy many wrongs. ,3489,3582
33,"Sit here, O noble youth, between me and my only son, Art, heir to my kingdom."" ",3582,3661
34,"An attendant took his weapons from the youth and hung them on the wall with the rest, and Finn sat down between the King of Ireland and his only son. ",3661,3811
35,"Choice food was set before him, which he ate, and old ale, which he drank. ",3811,3886
36,From the moment he entered no one thought of anything but of him. ,3886,3952
37,"When Finn had made an end of eating and drinking, he said to the King: ""O illustrious prince, though it is not right for a guest to even seem to observe aught that may be awry, or not as it should be, in the hall of his entertainer, yet the sorrow of a kindly host is a sorrow, too, to his guest, and sometimes unawares the man of the house finds succour and help in the stranger. ",3952,4333
38,There is sorrow in this chamber of festivity. ,4333,4379
39,"If anyone who is dear to thee and thy people happens to be dead, I can do nothing. ",4379,4462
40,"But I say it, and it is not a vain boast, that even if a person is at the point of death, I can restore him to life and health, for there are marvellous powers of life-giving in my two hands."" ",4462,4655
41,"Conn the Hundred-Fighter answered, ""Our grief is not such as you suppose; ",4655,4729
42," and why should I not tell a cause of shame, which is known far and wide? ",4728,4802
43,"This, then, is the reason of our being together, and the gloom which is over us. ",4802,4883
44,There is a mighty enchanter whose dwelling is in the haunted mountains of Slieve Gullion in the north. ,4883,4986
45,"His name is Allen, son of Midna, and his enmity to me is as great as his power. ",4986,5066
46,"Once every year, at this season, it is his pleasure to burn Tara. ",5066,5132
47,"Descending out of his wizard haunts, he standeth over against the city and shoots balls of fire out of his mouth against it, till it is consumed. ",5132,5278
48,Then he goes away mocking and triumphant. ,5278,5320
49,"This annual building of Tara, only to be annually consumed, is a shame to me, and till this enchanter declared war against me, I have lived without reproach."" ",5320,5479
50,"""But,"" said Finn, ""how is it that thy young warriors, valiant and swift, do not repel him, or kill him?"" ",5479,5584
51,"""Alas!"" ",5584,5592
52,"said Conn, ""all our valour is in vain against this man. ",5592,5648
53,"Our hosts encompass Tara on all sides, keeping watch and ward when the fatal night comes. ",5648,5738
54,"Then the son of Midna plays on his Druidic instrument of music, on his magic pipe and his magic lyre, and as the fairy music falls on our ears, our eyelids grow heavy, and soon all subside upon the grass in deep slumber. ",5738,5959
55,"So comes this man against the city and shoots his fire-balls against it, and utterly consumes it. ",5959,6057
56,"Nine years he has burnt Tara in that manner, and this is the tenth. ",6057,6125
57,At midnight to-night he will come and do the same. ,6125,6176
58,"Last year (though it was a shame to me that I, who am the high King over all Ireland, should not be able myself to defend Tara) I summoned Gaul mac Morna and all the Fians to my assistance. ",6176,6366
59,"They came, but the pipe and lyre of the son of Midna prevailed over them too, so that Tara was burned as at other times. ",6366,6487
60,"Nor have we any reason to believe that the son of Midna will not burn the city again to-night, as he did last year. ",6487,6603
61,All the women and children have been sent out of Tara this day. ,6603,6667
62,"We are only men of war here, waiting for the time. ",6667,6718
63,"That, O noble youth, is why we are sad. ",6718,6758
64,"The 'Pillars of Tara' are broken, and the might of the Fians is as nought before the power of this man."" ",6758,6863
65,"""What shall be my reward if I kill this man and save Tara?"" ",6863,6923
66,asked Finn. ,6923,6935
67,"""Thy inheritance,"" answered the King, ""be it great or small, and whether it lies in Ireland or beyond Ireland; ",6935,7046
68," and for securities I give you my son Art and Gaul mac Morna and the Chief of the Fians."" ",7045,7135
69,"Gaul and the captains of the Fianna consented to that arrangement, though reluctantly, for their minds misgave them as to who the great youth might be. ",7135,7287
70,"After that all arose and armed themselves and ringed Tara round with horse and foot, and thrice Conn the Hundred-Fighter raised his awful regal voice, enjoining vigilance upon his people, and thrice Gaul mac Morna did the same, addressing the Fians, and after that they filled their ears with wax and wool, and kept a stern and fierce watch, and many of them thrust the points of their swords into their flesh. ",7287,7698
71,"Now Finn was alone in the banqueting chamber after the rest had gone out, and he washed his face and his hands in pure water, and he took from the bag that was at his girdle the instruments of divination and magic, which had been his father's, and what use he made of them is not known; ",7698,7985
72," but ere long a man stood before him, holding a spear in one hand and a blue mantle in the other. ",7984,8082
73,There were twenty nails of gold of Arabia in the spear. ,8082,8138
74,"The nails glittered like stars, and twinkled with live light as stars do in a frosty night, and the blade of it quivered like a tongue of white fire. ",8138,8288
75,From haft to blade-point that spear was alive. ,8288,8335
76,"There were voices in it too, and the war-tunes of the enchanted races of Erin, whom they called the Tuatha De Danan, sounded from it. ",8335,8469
77,"The mantle, too, was a wonder, for innumerable stars twinkled in the blue, and the likeness of clouds passed through it. ",8469,8590
78,"The man gave these things to Finn, and when he had instructed him in their use, he was not seen. ",8590,8687
79,"Then Finn arose and armed himself, and took the magic spear and mantle and went out. ",8687,8772
80,"There was a ring of flame round Tara that night, for the Fians and the warriors of Conn had torches in their hands, and all the royal buildings of Tara showed clear in the light, and also the dark serpentine course of the Boyne, which flowed past Tara on the north; ",8772,9038
81," and there, standing silent and alert, were the innumerable warriors of all Erin, with spear and shield, keeping watch and ward against the son of Midna, also the Four Pillars of Tara in four dense divisions around the high King, even Conn the Hundred-Fighter. ",9037,9298
82,"Finn stood with his back to the palace, which was called the House-of-the-going-round-of-Mead, between the palace and Conn, and he grasped the magic spear strongly with one hand and the mantle with the other. ",9298,9507
83,"As midnight drew nigh, he heard far away in the north, out of the mountains of Slieve Gullion, a fairy tune played, soft, low, and slow, as if on a silver flute; ",9507,9669
84," and at the same time the roar of Conn the Hundred-Fighter, and the voice of Gaul like thunder, and the responsive shouts of the captains, and the clamour of the host, for the host shouted all together, and clashed their swords against their shields in fierce defiance, when in spite of all obstructions the fairy music of the enchanter began to steal into their souls. ",9668,10038
85,"That shout was heard all over Ireland, echoing from sea to sea, and the hollow buildings of Tara reverberated to the uproar. ",10038,10163
86,"Yet through it all could be heard the low, slow, delicious music that came from Slieve Gullion. ",10163,10259
87,Finn put the point of the spear to his forehead. ,10259,10308
88,"It burned him like fire, yet his stout heart did not fail. ",10308,10367
89,"Then the roar of the host slowly faded away as in a dream, though the captains were still shouting, and two-thirds of the torches fell to the ground. ",10367,10517
90,"And now, succeeding the flute music, sounded the music of a stringed instrument exceedingly sweet. ",10517,10616
91,"Finn pressed the cruel spear-head closer to his forehead, and saw every torch fall, save one which wavered as if held by a drunken man, and beneath it a giant figure that reeled and tottered and strove in vain to keep its feet. ",10616,10844
92,It was Conn the Hundred-Fighter. ,10844,10877
93,As he fell there was a roar as of many waters; ,10877,10924
94, it was the ocean mourning for the high King's fall. ,10923,10976
95,Finn passed through the fallen men and stood alone on the dark hill-side. ,10976,11050
96,"He heard the feet of the enchanter splashing through the Boyne, and saw his huge form ascending the slopes of Tara. ",11050,11166
97,"When the enchanter saw that all was silent and dark there he laughed and from his mouth blew a red fire-ball at the Teck-Midcuarta, which he was accustomed first to set in flames. ",11166,11346
98,Finn caught the fire-ball in the magic mantle. ,11346,11393
99,"The enchanter blew a second and a third, and Finn caught them both. ",11393,11461
100,"The man saw that his power over Tara was at an end, and that his magic arts had been defeated. ",11461,11556
101,"On the third occasion he saw Finn's face, and recognised his conqueror. ",11556,11628
102,"He turned to flee, and though slow was his coming, swifter than the wind was his going, that he might recover the protection of his enchanted palace before the ""fair-faced youth clad in skins"" should overtake him. ",11628,11842
103,"Finn let fall the mantle as he had been instructed, and pursued him, but in vain. ",11842,11924
104,Soon he perceived that he could not possibly overtake the swift enchanter. ,11924,11999
105,Then he was aware that the magic spear struggled in his hand like a hound in a leash. ,11999,12085
106,"""Go, then, if thou wilt,"" he said, and, poising, cast the spear from him. ",12085,12159
107,It shot through the dark night hissing and screaming. ,12159,12213
108,There was a track of fire behind it. ,12213,12250
109,"Finn followed, and on the threshold of the enchanted palace he found the body of Midna. ",12250,12338
110,"He was quite dead, with the blood pouring through a wound in the middle of his back; ",12338,12423
111, but the spear was gone. ,12422,12447
112,"Finn drew his sword and cut off the enchanter's head, and returned with it to Tara. ",12447,12531
113,"When he came to the spot where he had dropped the mantle it was not seen, but smoke and flame issued there from a hole in the ground. ",12531,12665
114,"That hole was twenty feet deep in the earth, and at the bottom of it there was a fire always from that night, and it was never extinguished. ",12665,12806
115,It was called the fire of the son of Midna. ,12806,12850
116,"It was in a depression on the north side of the hill of Tara, called the Glen of the Mantle, Glen-a-Brat. ",12850,12956
117,"Finn, bearing the head, passed through the sleepers into the palace and spiked the head on his own spear, and drove the spear-end into the ground at Conn's end of the great hall. ",12956,13135
118,"Then the sickness and faintness of death came upon Finn, also a great horror and despair overshadowed him, so that he was about to give himself up for utterly lost. ",13135,13300
119,"Yet he recalled one of his marvellous attributes, and approaching a silver vessel, into which pure water ever flowed and which was always full, he made a cup with his two hands and, lifting it to his mouth, drank, and the blood began to circulate in his veins, and strength returned to his limbs, and the cheerful hue of rosy health to his cheeks. ",13300,13648
120,"Having rested himself sufficiently he went forth and shouted to the sleeping host, and called the captains by their names, beginning with Conn. ",13648,13792
121,"They awoke and rose up, though dazed and stupid, for it was difficult for any man, no matter how he had stopped his ears, to avoid hearing Finn when he sent forth his voice of power. ",13792,13975
122,"They were astonished to find that Tara was still standing, for though the night was dark, the palaces and temples, all of hewn timber, were brilliantly coloured and of many hues, for in those days men delighted in splendid colours. ",13975,14207
123,"When the captains came together Finn said, ""I have slain Midna."" ",14207,14272
124,"""Where is his head?"" ",14272,14293
125,"they asked, not because they disbelieved him, but because the heads of men slain in battle were always brought away for trophies. ",14293,14423
126,"""Come and see,"" answered Finn. ",14423,14454
127,"Conn and his only son and Gaul mac Morna followed the young hero into the Teck-Midcuarta, where the spear-long waxen candles were still burning, and when they saw the head of Midna impaled there at the end of the hall, the head of the man whom they believed to be immortal and not to be wounded or conquered, they were filled with great joy, and praised their deliverer and paid him many compliments. ",14454,14855
128,"""Who art thou, O brave youth?"" ",14855,14886
129,"said Conn. ""Surely thou art the son of some great king or champion, for heroic feats like thine are not performed by the sons of inconsiderable and unknown men."" ",14886,15048
130,"Then Finn flung back his cloak of wild boars' skins, and holding his father's treasure-bag in his hand before them all, cried in a loud voice: ""I am Finn, the son of Cool, the son of Trenmor, the son of Basna; ",15048,15258
131, I am he whom the sons of Morna have been seeking to destroy from the time that I was born; ,15257,15349
132," and here to-night, O King of the Kings of Erin, I claim the fulfilment of thy promise, and the restoration of my inheritance, which is the Fian leadership of Fail."" ",15348,15514
133,"Thereupon Gaul mac Morna put his right hand into Finn's, and became his man. ",15514,15591
134,"Then his brothers and his sons, and the sons of his brothers, did so in succession, and after that all the chief men of the Fians did the same, and that night Finn was solemnly and surely installed in the Fian leadership of Erin, and put in possession of all the woods and forests and waste places, and all the hills and mountains and promontories, and all the streams and rivers of Erin, and the harbours and estuaries and the harbour-dues of the merchants, and all ships and boats and galleys with their mariners, and all that pertained of old time to the Fian leadership of Fail.",15591,16174
