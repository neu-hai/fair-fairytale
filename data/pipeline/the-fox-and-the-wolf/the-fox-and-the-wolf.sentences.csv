0,"There was once a Fox and a Wolf, who set up house together in a cave near the sea-shore. ",0,89
1,"Although you may not think so, they got on very well for a time, for they went out hunting all day, and when they came back at night they were generally too tired to do anything but to eat their supper and go to bed. ",89,306
2,"They might have lived together always had it not been for the slyness and greediness of the Fox, who tried to over-reach his companion, who was not nearly so clever as he was. ",306,482
3,And this was how it came about. ,482,514
4,"It chanced, one dark December night, that there was a dreadful storm at sea, and in the morning the beach was all strewn with wreckage. ",514,650
5,So as soon as it was daylight the two friends went down to the shore to see if they could find anything to eat. ,650,762
6,"They had the good fortune to light on a great Keg of Butter, which had been washed overboard from some ship on its way home from Ireland, where, as all the world knows, folk are famous for their butter. ",762,965
7,The simple Wolf danced with joy when he saw it. ,965,1013
8,"""Marrowbones and trotters! ",1013,1040
9,"but we will have a good supper this night,"" cried he, licking his lips. ",1040,1112
10,"""Let us set to work at once and roll it up to the cave."" ",1112,1169
11,"But the wily Fox was fond of butter, and he made up his mind that he would have it all to himself. ",1169,1268
12,"So he put on his wisest look, and shook his head gravely. ",1268,1326
13,"""You have no prudence, my friend,"" he said reproachfully, ""else would you not talk of breaking up a Keg of Butter at this time of year, when the stackyards are full of good grain, which can be had for the eating, and the farmyards are stocked with nice fat ducks and poultry. ",1326,1602
14,"No, no. ",1602,1610
15,"It behoveth us to have foresight, and to lay up in store for the spring, when the grain is all threshed, and the stackyards are bare, and the poultry have gone to market. ",1610,1781
16,"So we will e'en bury the Keg, and dig it up when we have need of it."" ",1781,1851
17,"Very reluctantly, for he was thinner and hungrier than the Fox, the Wolf agreed to this proposal. ",1851,1949
18,"So a hole was dug, and the Keg was buried, and the two animals went off hunting as usual. ",1949,2039
19,"About a week passed by: then one day the Fox came into the cave, and flung himself down on the ground as if he were very much exhausted. ",2039,2176
20,But if anyone had looked at him closely they would have seen a sly twinkle in his eye. ,2176,2263
21,"""Oh, dear, oh, dear!"" ",2263,2285
22,he sighed. ,2285,2296
23,"""Life is a heavy burden."" ",2296,2322
24,"""What have befallen you?"" ",2322,2348
25,"asked the Wolf, who was ever kind and soft-hearted. ",2348,2400
26,"""Some friends of mine, who live over the hills yonder, are wanting me to go to a christening to-night. ",2400,2503
27,"Just think of the distance that I must travel."" ",2503,2551
28,"""But do you need to go?"" ",2551,2576
29,asked the Wolf. ,2576,2592
30,"""Can you not send an excuse?"" ",2592,2622
31,"""I doubt that no excuse would be accepted,"" answered the Fox, ""for they asked me to stand god-father. ",2622,2724
32,"Therefore it behoveth me to do my duty, and pay no heed to my own feelings."" ",2724,2801
33,"So that evening the Fox was absent, and the Wolf was alone in the cave. ",2801,2873
34,But it was not to a christening that the sly Fox went; ,2873,2928
35, it was to the Keg of Butter that was buried in the sand. ,2927,2985
36,"About midnight he returned, looking fat and sleek, and well pleased with himself. ",2985,3067
37,"The Wolf had been dozing, but he looked up drowsily as his companion entered. ",3067,3145
38,"""Well, how did they name the bairn?"" ",3145,3182
39,he asked. ,3182,3192
40,"""They gave it a queer name,"" answered the Fox. ",3192,3239
41,"""One of the queerest names that I ever heard."" ",3239,3286
42,"""And what was that?"" ",3286,3307
43,questioned the Wolf. ,3307,3328
44,"""Nothing less than 'Blaisean' (Let-me-taste),"" replied the Fox, throwing himself down in his corner. ",3328,3429
45,And if the Wolf could have seen him in the darkness he would have noticed that he was laughing to himself. ,3429,3536
46,Some days afterwards the same thing happened. ,3536,3582
47,The Fox was asked to another christening; ,3582,3624
48, this time at a place some twenty-five miles along the shore. ,3623,3685
49,"And as he had grumbled before, so he grumbled again; ",3685,3738
50," but he declared that it was his duty to go, and he went. ",3737,3795
51,"At midnight he came back, smiling to himself and with no appetite for his supper. ",3795,3877
52,"And when the Wolf asked him the name of the child, he answered that it was a more extraordinary name than the other--""Be na Inheadnon"" (Be in its middle). ",3877,4032
53,"The very next week, much to the Wolf's wonder, the Fox was asked to yet another christening. ",4032,4125
54,"And this time the name of the child was ""Sgriot an Clar"" (Scrape the staves). ",4125,4203
55,After that the invitations ceased. ,4203,4238
56,"Time went on, and the hungry spring came, and the Fox and the Wolf had their larder bare, for food was scarce, and the weather was bleak and cold. ",4238,4385
57,"""Let us go and dig up the Keg of Butter,"" said the Wolf. ",4385,4442
58,"""Methinks that now is the time we need it."" ",4442,4486
59,The Fox agreed--having made up his mind how he would act--and the two set out to the place where the Keg had been hidden. ,4486,4608
60,"They scraped away the sand, and uncovered it; ",4608,4654
61," but, needless to say, they found it empty. ",4653,4697
62,"""This is your work,"" said the Fox angrily, turning to the poor, innocent Wolf. ",4697,4776
63,"""You have crept along here while I was at the christenings, and eaten it up by stealth."" ",4776,4865
64,"""Not I,"" replied the Wolf. ",4865,4892
65,"""I have never been near the spot since the day that we buried it together."" ",4892,4968
66,"""But I tell you it must have been you,"" insisted the Fox, ""for no other creature knew it was there except ourselves. ",4968,5085
67,"And, besides, I can see by the sleekness of your fur that you have fared well of late."" ",5085,5173
68,"Which last sentence was both unjust and untrue, for the poor Wolf looked as lean and badly nourished as he could possibly be. ",5173,5299
69,"So back they both went to the cave, arguing all the way. ",5299,5356
70,"The Fox declaring that the Wolf must have been the thief, and the Wolf protesting his innocence. ",5356,5453
71,"""Are you ready to swear to it?"" ",5453,5485
72,said the Fox at last; ,5485,5507
73," though why he asked such a question, dear only knows. ",5506,5561
74,"""Yes, I am,"" replied the Wolf firmly; ",5561,5599
75," and, standing in the middle of the cave, and holding one paw up solemnly he swore this awful oath: ""If it be that I stole the butter; ",5598,5733
76," if it be, if it be-- May a fateful, fell disease fall on me, fall on me."" ",5732,5807
77,"When he was finished, he put down his paw and, turning to the Fox, looked at him keenly; ",5807,5896
78, for all at once it struck him that his fur looked sleek and fine. ,5895,5962
79,"""It is your turn now,"" he said. ",5962,5994
80,"""I have sworn, and you must do so also."" ",5994,6035
81,"The Fox's face fell at these words, for although he was both untruthful and dishonest now, he had been well brought up in his youth, and he knew that it was a terrible thing to perjure oneself and swear falsely. ",6035,6247
82,"So he made one excuse after another, but the Wolf, who was getting more and more suspicious every moment, would not listen to him. ",6247,6378
83,"So, as he had not courage to tell the truth, he was forced at last to swear an oath also, and this was what he swore: ""If it be that I stole the butter; ",6378,6531
84," if it be, if it be-- Then let some most deadly punishment fall on me, fall on me-- Whirrum wheeckam, whirrum wheeckam, Whirram whee, whirram whee!"" ",6530,6679
85,"After he had heard him swear this terrible oath, the Wolf thought that his suspicions must be groundless, and he would have let the matter rest; ",6679,6824
86," but the Fox, having an uneasy conscience, could not do so. ",6823,6883
87,"So he suggested that as it was clear that one of them must have eaten the Keg of Butter, they should both stand near the fire; ",6883,7010
88," so that when they became hot, the butter would ooze out of the skin of whichever of them was guilty. ",7009,7111
89,And he took care that the Wolf should stand in the hottest place. ,7111,7177
90,But the fire was big and the cave was small; ,7177,7222
91," and while the poor lean Wolf showed no sign of discomfort, he himself, being nice and fat and comfortable, soon began to get unpleasantly warm. ",7221,7366
92,"As this did not suit him at all, he next proposed that they should go for a walk, ""for,"" said he, ""it is now quite plain that neither of us can have taken the butter. ",7366,7533
93,"It must have been some stranger who hath found out our secret."" ",7533,7597
94,"But the Wolf had seen the Fox beginning to grow greasy, and he knew now what had happened, and he determined to have his revenge. ",7597,7727
95,"So he waited until they came to a smithy which stood at the side of the road, where a horse was waiting just outside the door to be shod. ",7727,7865
96,"Then, keeping at a safe distance, he said to his companion, ""There is writing on that smithy door, which I cannot read, as my eyes are failing; ",7865,8009
97," do thou try to read it, for perchance it may be something it were good for us to know."" ",8008,8097
98,"And the silly Fox, who was very vain, and did not like to confess that his eyes were no better than those of his friend, went close up to the door to try and read the writing. ",8097,8273
99,"And he chanced to touch the horse's fetlock, and, it being a restive beast, lifted its foot and struck out at once, and killed the Fox as dead as a door-nail. ",8273,8432
100,"And so, you see, the old saying in the Good Book came true after all: ""Be sure your sin will find you out.""",8432,8540
