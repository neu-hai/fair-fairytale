0,"In the Kingdom of Fife, in the days of long ago, there lived an old man and his wife. ",0,86
1,"The old man was a douce, quiet body, but the old woman was lightsome and flighty, and some of the neighbours were wont to look at her askance, and whisper to each other that they sorely feared that she was a Witch. ",86,301
2,"And her husband was afraid of it, too, for she had a curious habit of disappearing in the gloaming and staying out all night; ",301,427
3," and when she returned in the morning she looked quite white and tired, as if she had been travelling far, or working hard. ",426,550
4,"He used to try and watch her carefully, in order to find out where she went, or what she did, but he never managed to do so, for she always slipped out of the door when he was not looking, and before he could reach it to follow her, she had vanished utterly. ",550,809
5,"At last, one day, when he could stand the uncertainty no longer, he asked her to tell him straight out whether she were a Witch or no. ",809,944
6,"And his blood ran cold when, without the slightest hesitation, she answered that she was; ",944,1034
7," and if he would promise not to let anyone know, the next time that she went on one of her midnight expeditions she would tell him all about it. ",1033,1178
8,The Goodman promised; ,1178,1200
9, for it seemed to him just as well that he should know all about his wife's cantrips. ,1199,1285
10,He had not long to wait before he heard of them. ,1285,1334
11,"For the very next week the moon was new, which is, as everybody knows, the time of all others when Witches like to stir abroad; ",1334,1462
12, and on the first night of the new moon his wife vanished. ,1461,1520
13,Nor did she return till daybreak next morning. ,1520,1567
14,"And when he asked her where she had been, she told him, in great glee, how she and four like-minded companions had met at the old Kirk on the moor and had mounted branches of the green bay tree and stalks of hemlock, which had instantly changed into horses, and how they had ridden, swift as the wind, over the country, hunting the foxes, and the weasels, and the owls; ",1567,1937
15, and how at last they had swam the Forth and come to the top of Bell Lomond. ,1936,2013
16,"And how there they had dismounted from their horses, and drunk beer that had been brewed in no earthly brewery, out of horn cups that had been fashioned by no mortal hands. ",2013,2186
17,"And how, after that, a wee, wee man had jumped up from under a great mossy stone, with a tiny set of bagpipes under his arm, and how he had piped such wonderful music, that, at the sound of it, the very trouts jumped out of the Loch below, and the stoats crept out of their holes, and the corby crows and the herons came and sat on the trees in the darkness, to listen. ",2186,2556
18,"And how all the Witches danced until they were so weary that, when the time came for them to mount their steeds again, if they would be home before cock-crow, they could scarce sit on them for fatigue. ",2556,2758
19,"The Goodman listened to this long story in silence, shaking his head meanwhile, and, when it was finished, all that he answered was: ""And what the better are ye for all your dancing? ",2758,2941
20,"Ye'd have been a deal more comfortable at home."" ",2941,2990
21,At the next new moon the old wife went off again for the night; ,2990,3054
22," and when she returned in the morning she told her husband how, on this occasion, she and her friends had taken cockle-shells for boats, and had sailed away over the stormy sea till they reached Norway. ",3053,3256
23,"And there they had mounted invisible horses of wind, and had ridden and ridden, over mountains and glens, and glaciers, till they reached the land of the Lapps lying under its mantle of snow. ",3256,3448
24,"And here all the Elves, and Fairies, and Mermaids of the North were holding festival with Warlocks, and Brownies, and Pixies, and even the Phantom Hunters themselves, who are never looked upon by mortal eyes. ",3448,3657
25,"And the Witches from Fife held festival with them, and danced, and feasted, and sang with them, and, what was of more consequence, they learned from them certain wonderful words, which, when they uttered them, would bear them through the air, and would undo all bolts and bars, and so gain them admittance to any place soever where they wanted to be. ",3657,4008
26,"And after that they had come home again, delighted with the knowledge which they had acquired. ",4008,4103
27,"""What took you to such a land as that?"" ",4103,4143
28,"asked the old man, with a contemptuous grunt. ",4143,4189
29,"""You would hae been a sight warmer in your bed."" ",4189,4238
30,"But when his wife returned from her next adventure, he showed a little more interest in her doings. ",4238,4338
31,"For she told him how she and her friends had met in the cottage of one of their number, and how, having heard that the Lord Bishop of Carlisle had some very rare wine in his cellar, they had placed their feet on the crook from which the pot hung, and had pronounced the magic words which they had learned from the Elves of Lappland. ",4338,4671
32,"And, lo and behold! ",4671,4691
33,"they flew up the chimney like whiffs of smoke, and sailed through the air like little wreathes of cloud, and in less time than it takes to tell they landed at the Bishop's Palace at Carlisle. ",4691,4883
34,"And the bolts and the bars flew loose before them, and they went down to his cellar and sampled his wine, and were back in Fife, fine, sober, old women by cock-crow. ",4883,5049
35,"When he heard this, the old man started from his chair in right earnest, for he loved good wine above all things, and it was but seldom that it came his way. ",5049,5207
36,"""By my truth, but you are a wife to be proud of!"" ",5207,5257
37,he cried. ,5257,5267
38,"""Tell me the words, Woman! ",5267,5294
39,"and I will e'en go and sample his Lordship's wine for myself."" ",5294,5357
40,But the Goodwife shook her head. ,5357,5390
41,"""Na, na! ",5390,5399
42,"I cannot do that,"" she said, ""for if I did, you telled it over again, it would turn the whole world upside down. ",5399,5512
43,"For everybody would be leaving their own lawful work, and flying about the world after other folk's business and other folk's dainties. ",5512,5648
44,"So just bide content, Goodman. ",5648,5679
45,"You get on fine with the knowledge you already possess."" ",5679,5736
46,"And although the old man tried to persuade her with all the soft words he could think of, she would not tell him her secret. ",5736,5861
47,"But he was a sly old man, and the thought of the Bishop's wine gave him no rest. ",5861,5942
48,"So night after night he went and hid in the old woman's cottage, in the hope that his wife and her friends would meet there; ",5942,6067
49," and although for a long time it was all in vain, at last his trouble was rewarded. ",6066,6150
50,"For one evening the whole five old women assembled, and in low tones and with chuckles of laughter they recounted all that had befallen them in Lappland. ",6150,6304
51,"Then, running to the fireplace, they, one after another, climbed on a chair and put their feet on the sooty crook. ",6304,6419
52,"Then they repeated the magic words, and, hey, presto! ",6419,6473
53,they were up the lum and away before the old man could draw his breath. ,6473,6545
54,"""I can do that, too,"" he said to himself; ",6545,6587
55, and he crawled out of his hiding-place and ran to the fire. ,6586,6647
56,"He put his foot on the crook and repeated the words, and up the chimney he went, and flew through the air after his wife and her companions, as if he had been a Warlock born. ",6647,6822
57,"And, as Witches are not in the habit of looking over their shoulders, they never noticed that he was following them, until they reached the Bishop's Palace and went down into his cellar, then, when they found that he was among them, they were not too well pleased. ",6822,7087
58,"However, there was no help for it, and they settled down to enjoy themselves. ",7087,7165
59,"They tapped this cask of wine, and they tapped that, drinking a little of each, but not too much; ",7165,7263
60," for they were cautious old women, and they knew that if they wanted to get home before cock-crow it behoved them to keep their heads clear. ",7262,7403
61,"But the old man was not so wise, for he sipped, and he sipped, until at last he became quite drowsy, and lay down on the floor and fell fast asleep. ",7403,7552
62,"And his wife, seeing this, thought that she would teach him a lesson not to be so curious in the future. ",7552,7657
63,"So, when she and her four friends thought that it was time to be gone, she departed without waking him. ",7657,7761
64,"He slept peacefully for some hours, until two of the Bishop's servants, coming down to the cellar to draw wine for their Master's table, almost fell over him in the darkness. ",7761,7936
65,"Greatly astonished at his presence there, for the cellar door was fast locked, they dragged him up to the light and shook him, and cuffed him, and asked him how he came to be there. ",7936,8118
66,"And the poor old man was so confused at being awakened in this rough way, and his head seemed to whirl round so fast, that all he could stammer out was, ""that he came from Fife, and that he had travelled on the midnight wind."" ",8118,8345
67,"As soon as they heard that, the men servants cried out that he was a Warlock, and they dragged him before the Bishop, and, as Bishops in those days had a holy horror of Warlocks and Witches, he ordered him to be burned alive. ",8345,8571
68,"When the sentence was pronounced, you may be very sure that the poor old man wished with all his heart that he had stayed quietly at home in bed, and never hankered after the Bishop's wine. ",8571,8761
69,"But it was too late to wish that now, for the servants dragged him out into the courtyard, and put a chain round his waist, and fastened it to a great iron stake, and they piled faggots of wood round his feet and set them alight. ",8761,8991
70,"As the first tiny little tongue of flame crept up, the poor old man thought that his last hour had come. ",8991,9096
71,"But when he thought that, he forgot completely that his wife was a Witch. ",9096,9170
72,"For, just as the little tongue of flame began to singe his breeches, there was a swish and a flutter in the air, and a great Grey Bird, with outstretched wings, appeared in the sky, and swooped down suddenly, and perched for a moment on the old man's shoulder. ",9170,9431
73,"And in this Grey Bird's mouth was a little red pirnie, which, to everyone's amazement, it popped on to the prisoner's head. ",9431,9555
74,"Then it gave one fierce croak, and flew away again, but to the old man's ears that croak was the sweetest music that he had ever heard. ",9555,9691
75,"For to him it was the croak of no earthly bird, but the voice of his wife whispering words of magic to him. ",9691,9799
76,"And when he heard them he jumped for joy, for he knew that they were words of deliverance, and he shouted them aloud, and his chains fell off, and he mounted in the air--up and up--while the onlookers watched him in awestruck silence. ",9799,10034
77,"He flew right away to the Kingdom of Fife, without as much as saying good-bye to them; ",10034,10121
78," and when he found himself once more safely at home, you may be very sure that he never tried to find out his wife's secrets again, but left her alone to her own devices.",10120,10291
