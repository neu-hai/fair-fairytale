0,"ONCE upon a time there was a sinister old couple, who lived out under the open sky. ",0,84
1,"All that they had were three sons, an old cook-pot, an old frying-pan, and an old cat. ",84,171
2,"Then the man died, and after a time his wife died, too. ",171,227
3,Now their estate was to be divided. ,227,263
4,"So the oldest took the old cook-pot, and the second took the old frying-pan, and Ebe Ashpeter had no choice. ",263,372
5,"He had to take the old cat, and they did not ask him whether he wanted to or not. ",372,454
6,"""Brother Peter can scrape out the cook-pot after he has loaned it out,"" said Ebe. ",454,536
7,"""Brother Paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying-pan; ",536,606
8," but what am I to do with this wretched cat?"" ",605,651
9,And he was angry and envious. ,651,681
10,"Yet he scratched the cat and stroked it, and this pleased the cat so that she began to purr, and raised her tail in the air. ",681,806
11,"""Wait, wait, I'll help you yet,"" said the cat, ""wait, wait, I'll help you yet!"" ",806,886
12,There was nothing to bite or break in the hut. ,886,933
13,Brother Peter and Brother Paul had each of them gone off in a different direction. ,933,1016
14,"So Ebe set out, too, with the cat in the lead, himself following; ",1016,1082
15," but after a time he turned and went home again, to see whether the floor had been swept, and the cat tripped on alone. ",1081,1201
16,"After she had gone her way, tipp, tapp, tipp, tapp, for a while, she came to a great rock, and there she met an enormous herd of reindeer. ",1201,1340
17,"The cat crept softly around the herd, and then with one leap sprang between the horns of the finest buck. ",1340,1446
18,"""If you do not go where I want you to, I'll scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"" ",1446,1553
19,said she. ,1553,1563
20,"So the buck did not dare do anything save what the cat wished, and off they went over stick and stone, from cliff to cliff, close by Ebe, who was just polishing the door-sill of his house, and with one bound right into the castle. ",1563,1794
21,"""I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and ask whether my lord king might care to have this buck reindeer to drive,"" said the cat. ",1794,1929
22,"Yes, he could make good use of such a young, handsome animal, some time, when he had occasion to drive out to visit a neighboring king. ",1929,2065
23,"""This Ebe must be a proud and powerful lord,"" said the king, ""if he can make me such presents."" ",2065,2161
24,"""Yes, he is the greatest lord in all your land and kingdom,"" said the cat, but no matter how many questions the king asked, he learned nothing more. ",2161,2310
25,"""Tell him that I am much obliged,"" said the king, and he sent him a whole cart-load of handsome presents. ",2310,2416
26,But Ebe looked past them and paid no attention to them. ,2416,2472
27,"""Brother Peter can scrape out his cook-pot when he has loaned it out, and Brother Paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying-pan; ",2472,2615
28," but what am I to do with this wretched cat!"" ",2614,2660
29,"said he, and felt angry and envious; ",2660,2697
30," but still he scratched the cat, and stroked her, and this pleased her so much that she began to purr, and raised her tail in the air. ",2696,2831
31,"""Wait, wait, I will help you yet,"" said the cat, ""wait, wait, I will help you yet!"" ",2831,2915
32,"The next day they both set out again, the cat in the lead, and Ebe following. ",2915,2993
33,After a while he turned back to see whether the folding-table at home had been scoured. ,2993,3081
34,And the cat tripped on alone. ,3081,3111
35,"After she had gone her way, tipp, tapp, tipp, tapp, for a while, she came to a dense forest slope. ",3111,3210
36,There she found an enormous herd of elk. ,3210,3251
37,"The cat crept softly up, and suddenly there she sat between the horns of one of the stateliest of the bull elks. ",3251,3364
38,"""If you do not go where I want you to, I will scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"" ",3364,3473
39,said the cat. ,1915,1929
40,"The elk did not dare do anything save what the cat wished, and so off they went, like lightning, over stick and stone, from cliff to cliff, right past Ebe, who stood before the house scouring the shutters, and with one bound into the king's castle. ",3487,3736
41,"""I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and ask whether my lord king might not care to have this bull elk for courier service."" ",3736,3867
42,"It was quite clear that should the king want a swift messenger, some time, he could not find a swifter in all his kingdom. ",3867,3990
43,"""This Ebe must be a most distinguished lord, since he finds such presents for me,"" said the king. ",3990,4088
44,"""Yes, indeed, one might call him a distinguished lord,"" said the cat, ""his wealth is without end or limit."" ",4088,4196
45,"But no matter how many other questions the king asked, he received no more explicit information. ",4196,4293
46,"""Tell him that I am much obliged, and to do me the honor to call when he is passing here some time,"" said the king, and sent him a robe as handsome as the one he himself was wearing, and three cartloads of handsome presents. ",4293,4518
47,"But Ebe did not even want to put on the royal robe, and hardly looked at the other presents. ",4518,4611
48,"""Brother Peter can scrape out his cook-pot when he has loaned it out, Brother Paul gets a crust of bread when he lends out his frying-pan; ",4611,4750
49," but of what use is this wretched cat to me!"" ",4749,4795
50,"he said, in spite of all. ",4795,4821
51,"Yet he stroked the cat, and pressed her to his cheek, and scratched her, and this pleased the cat so very much that she purred more than on the other occasions, and stuck her tail up into the air as straight as a rod. ",4821,5039
52,"""Wait, wait, I will help you yet,"" said the cat, ""wait, wait, I will help you yet!"" ",2831,2915
53,"On the third day they set out again, the cat in the lead, and Ebe following. ",5123,5200
54,"After a time it occurred to him to go back and let the mice out of the house, so that they would not be altogether starved in the old hut; ",5200,5339
55, and the cat tripped on alone. ,1170,1201
56,"After she had gone her way, tipp, tapp, tipp, tapp, for a while, she came to a dense pine forest, and there she met a father bear, a mother bear and a baby bear. ",5369,5531
57,"The cat crept softly up to them, and all at once she was hanging by her claws to the father bear's head. ",5531,5636
58,"""If you do not go where I want you to, I will scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"" ",3364,3473
59,"said the cat, and spit and arched her back. ",5745,5789
60,"Then the father bear did not dare do anything save what the cat wished, and now they dashed past Ebe, who had just carried all the young mice over the threshold, like a storm, over stick and stone, from cliff to cliff, so that the earth trembled and shook. ",5789,6046
61,"The king was just standing in the hallway, and was not a little surprised to see such guests arriving. ",6046,6149
62,"""I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and ask whether my lord king might not care to have this bear for a general or royal counselor,"" said the cat. ",6149,6303
63,"The king was more than pleased to secure such a creature for his nearest adviser, who could doubt it. ",6303,6405
64,"""Tell him that I am much obliged, but that I do not at all know how to show my appreciation,"" said the king. ",6405,6514
65,"""Well, he would like to marry your youngest daughter!"" ",6514,6569
66,said the cat. ,1915,1929
67,"""Yes, but that is asking a good deal,"" said the king. ",6583,6637
68,"""He really ought to pay me a visit."" ",6637,6674
69,"""Ebe does not enter such plain houses,"" said the cat. ",6674,6728
70,"""Has he a handsomer castle than this?"" ",6728,6767
71,asked the king. ,6767,6783
72,"""Handsomer? ",6783,6795
73,"Why, your castle seems like the shabbiest hut in comparison with his!"" ",6795,6866
74,was the cat's reply. ,6866,6887
75,"""You dare come into my presence, and tell me that there is some one living in my kingdom who is more handsomely housed than I, the king!"" ",6887,7025
76,"shouted the king, beside himself with rage. ",7025,7069
77,He came near wringing the cat's neck. ,7069,7107
78,"""You might wait until you see it,"" said the cat. ",7107,7156
79,"And the king said yes, he would wait. ",7156,7194
80,"""But if you have told me a falsehood, you shall die, and though you had seven lives,"" said he. ",7194,7289
81,In the morning the king and the whole court set out to travel to Ebe Ashpeter's castle. ,7289,7377
82,"The cat was in the little hut, and called for Ebe, thinking it would be best if both of them got underway an hour earlier. ",7377,7500
83,"After they had gone a while, they met some folk who were herding sheep; ",7500,7572
84, and the sheep were bleating and grazing over the whole plain. ,7571,7634
85,"They were as large as full-grown calves, and their wool was so long that it dragged along the ground after them. ",7634,7747
86,"""To whom do the sheep belong?"" ",7747,7778
87,asked the cat. ,7778,7793
88,"""To Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,"" said the shepherds. ",7793,7846
89,"""The court is coming past in a moment,"" said the cat, ""and if then you do not at once say that they belong to Ebe, I will scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"" ",7846,8031
90,"said the cat, and spat and arched her back, and showed her teeth. ",8031,8097
91,Then the shepherds were so frightened that they at once promised to do as the cat had ordered. ,8097,8192
92,"""But to whom do all these sheep belong?"" ",8192,8233
93,"asked the king, when he came by with the court somewhat later. ",8233,8296
94,"""They are every bit as handsome as my own!"" ",8296,8340
95,"""They belong to Ebe,"" said the shepherds. ",8340,8382
96,"Then the cat and Ebe wandered on for a while, and came to a dense forest slope. ",8382,8462
97,There they met folk who were tending goats. ,8462,8506
98,"The goats skipped and leaped about everywhere, and gave such fine milk that better could no where be found. ",8506,8614
99,"""To whom do the goats belong?"" ",8614,8645
100,asked the cat. ,7778,7793
101,"""To Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,"" said the herdsmen. ",8660,8712
102,"Then the cat again went through her ferocious preparations, and the herdsmen were so frightened that they did not dare oppose her wishes. ",8712,8850
103,"""Now who in the world can be the owner of so many goats?"" ",8850,8908
104,asked the king. ,6767,6783
105,"""I myself have none finer!"" ",8924,8952
106,"""They belong to Ebe,"" said the herdsmen. ",8952,8993
107,"Then they wandered on for a while, and met folk who were tending cows: wherever one looked the cows lowed and glistened, and each yielded milk enough for three. ",8993,9154
108,"When the cat heard that these herdsmen were also in the service of Helge-Hal of the Blue Hill, she spat once more, and arched her back, and then all the herdsmen were ready that moment to say what she wished. ",9154,9363
109,"""But in heaven's name, to whom do all these beautiful cattle belong?"" ",9363,9433
110,asked the king. ,6767,6783
111,"""There are no such cattle in my whole kingdom!"" ",9449,9497
112,"""They belong to Lord Ebe,"" said the herdsmen. ",9497,9543
113,"Then they wandered on for a long, long time. ",9543,9588
114,"At last they came to a great plain, and there they met horse-herders; ",9588,9658
115," and horses whinnied and disported themselves over the whole plain, and their coats were so fine that they glistened as though gilded, and each horse was worth a whole castle. ",9657,9833
116,"""For whom do you herd these horses?"" ",9833,9870
117,asked the cat. ,7778,7793
118,"""For Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,"" the herders replied. ",9885,9940
119,"""Well, the court will come by here in a little while,"" said the cat, ""and if you do not say you are herding them for Ebe, I will scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!"" ",9940,10132
120,"said the cat, and she spat, and showed her teeth and claws, and grew so angry her hair stood up all along her back. ",10132,10248
121,"Then the herders were terribly frightened, and did not dare do anything but what the cat wished. ",10248,10345
122,"""But in the name of heaven, to whom do all these horses belong?"" ",10345,10410
123,"asked the king, when he came by with his court. ",10410,10458
124,"""They belong to Ebe,"" said the herders. ",10458,10498
125,"""I never have seen or heard anything like it in all my life!"" ",10498,10560
126,cried the king. ,10560,10576
127,"""This Ebe is such a distinguished lord that it is past my understanding!"" ",10576,10650
128,"The cat and Ebe had long since gone on their way, and had wandered far and ever farther over hill and rock. ",10650,10758
129,"In the evening, at dusk, they came to a royal castle that glittered and shimmered as though it were of the purest silver and gold-which it was. ",10758,10902
130,"Yet it was gloomy and depressing, and lonely and barren there, and nowhere was there a sign of life. ",10902,11003
131,"Here they went in, and the cat stood with a cake of rye meal just below the door. ",11003,11085
132,"Suddenly there came a thundering and a thumping so that the earth trembled, and the whole castle shook, and that was the troll who was coming home. ",11085,11233
133,"And suddenly all was quiet again, and before they knew it, Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill had thrust his three great horrible heads in at the door. ",11233,11377
134,"""Let me in! ",11377,11389
135,"Let me in!"" ",11389,11401
136,"he cried, so that every one shivered. ",11401,11439
137,"""Wait, wait a bit while I tell you what the rye had to go through before he was made into this cake,"" said the cat, and spoke to him in the sweetest way. ",11439,11593
138,"""First he was threshed, and then he was beaten, and then he was pounded, and then he was thumped, and then he was thrown from one wall to another, and then he was sifted through a sieve...."" ""Let me in! ",11593,11796
139,"Let me in, you chatterbox!"" ",11796,11824
140,"cried the troll, and he was so furious that the sparks flew from him. ",11824,11894
141,"""Wait a bit, wait a bit. ",11894,11919
142,"I will tell you what the rye had to go through before he was made into this cake!"" ",11919,12002
143,"said the cat, and he spoke to him still more sweetly. ",12002,12056
144,"""First he was threshed, and then he was beaten, and then he was pounded, and then he was thumped, and then he was thrown from one wall to another, and then he was sifted through a sieve, and shaken here and there, and then he was put on the drying-board, and then in the stove, until it grew so hot that he puffed up more and more, and wanted to get out, but could not,"" said the cat, and took her time. ",12056,12460
145,"""Get out of the way and let me in!"" ",12460,12496
146,"cried the troll once more, and nearly burst with rage; ",12496,12551
147," but the cat acted as though she did not hear him, and talked down the blue from the sky, and went up and down the while, and whenever the troll tried to come in, she met him beneath the door with the cake. ",12550,12757
148,"""O, but do take a look at the shining maiden coming up there behind the mountain!"" ",12757,12840
149,"said the cat, after she had talked at length about the sufferings of the rye. ",12840,12918
150,"And Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill turned his three heads around in order to see the beautiful maiden, too. ",12918,13022
151,"Then the sun rose, and the troll stiffened into stone. ",13022,13077
152,"Now Ebe obtained all the riches that the troll had possessed, the sheep and goats, the cows and all the spirited horses, and the handsome golden castle, and some big bags of money besides. ",13077,13266
153,"""Here come the king and all his court,"" said the cat. ",13266,13320
154,"""Just go out before the door and receive them!"" ",13320,13368
155,So Ebe got up and went to meet them. ,13368,13405
156,"""You are indeed a very distinguished lord!"" ",13405,13449
157,said the king to him. ,13449,13471
158,"""So far as I am concerned you may have the youngest princess!"" ",13471,13534
159,"Then they started brewing and baking on a large scale in the greatest haste, and everything was made ready for the wedding. ",13534,13658
160,On the first day of the feast the cat came and begged the bridegroom to cut off her head. ,13658,13748
161,This he did not at all want to do; ,13748,13783
162," but the cat spat and showed her teeth, and then Ebe did not dare disobey her. ",13782,13861
163,"But when the head fell to the ground, the cat turned into a most handsome prince. ",13861,13943
164,"He married the second princess, and as the wedding procession was on its way to church, they met a third prince who was looking for a wife, and he took the oldest princess. ",13943,14116
165,Then they all three celebrated their weddings so that the story went the rounds in twelve kingdoms. ,14116,14216
166,"""Spin, span, spun, Now our tale is done!""",14216,14258
