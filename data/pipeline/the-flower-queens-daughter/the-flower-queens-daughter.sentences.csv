0,"A young Prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him, when he came to a deep open ditch. ",0,128
1,"He was turning aside to avoid it, when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch. ",128,218
2,"He dismounted from his horse, and stepped along in the direction the sound came from. ",218,304
3,"To his astonishment he found an old woman, who begged him to help her out of the ditch. ",304,392
4,"The Prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there. ",392,515
5,"'My son,' answered the old woman, 'I am a very poor woman, and soon after midnight I set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning; ",515,699
6," but I lost my way in the dark, and fell into this deep ditch, where I might have remained for ever but for your kindness.' ",698,822
7,"Then the Prince said to her, 'You can hardly walk; ",822,873
8, I will put you on my horse and lead you home. ,872,919
9,Where do you live?' ,919,939
10,"'Over there, at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance,' replied the old woman. ",939,1045
11,"The Prince lifted her on to his horse, and soon they reached the hut, where the old woman got down, and turning to the Prince said, 'Just wait a moment, and I will give you something.' ",1045,1230
12,"And she disappeared into her hut, but returned very soon and said, 'You are a mighty Prince, but at the same time you have a kind heart, which deserves to be rewarded. ",1230,1398
13,Would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife?' ,1398,1475
14,"'Most certainly I would,' replied the Prince. ",1475,1521
15,"So the old woman continued, 'The most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the Queen of the Flowers, who has been captured by a dragon. ",1521,1674
16,"If you wish to marry her, you must first set her free, and this I will help you to do. ",1674,1761
17,"I will give you this little bell: if you ring it once, the King of the Eagles will appear; ",1761,1852
18," if you ring it twice, the King of the Foxes will come to you; ",1851,1914
19," and if you ring it three times, you will see the King of the Fishes by your side. ",1913,1996
20,These will help you if you are in any difficulty. ,1996,2046
21,"Now farewell, and heaven prosper your undertaking.' ",2046,2098
22,"She handed him the little bell, and there disappeared hut and all, as though the earth had swallowed her up. ",2098,2207
23,"When it dawned on the Prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy, and putting the little bell carefully in his pocket, he rode home and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the Flower Queen free, and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid. ",2207,2514
24,So the next morning the Prince mounted his fine horse and left his home. ,2514,2587
25,"He had roamed round the world for a whole year, and his horse had died of exhaustion, while he himself had suffered much from want and misery, but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of. ",2587,2792
26,"At last one day he came to a hut, in front of which sat a very old man. ",2792,2864
27,"The Prince asked him, 'Do you not know where the Dragon lives who keeps the daughter of the Flower Queen prisoner?' ",2864,2980
28,"'No, I do not,' answered the old man. ",2980,3018
29,"'But if you go straight along this road for a year, you will reach a hut where my father lives, and possibly he may be able to tell you.' ",3018,3156
30,"The Prince thanked him for his information, and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road, and at the end of it came to the little hut, where he found a very old man. ",3156,3340
31,"He asked him the same question, and the old man answered, 'No, I do not know where the Dragon lives. ",3340,3441
32,"But go straight along this road for another year, and you will come to a hut in which my father lives. ",3441,3544
33,I know he can tell you.' ,3544,3569
34,"And so the Prince wandered on for another year, always on the same road, and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man. ",3569,3704
35,He put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson; ,3704,3775
36," but this time the old man answered, 'The Dragon lives up there on the mountain, and he has just begun his year of sleep. ",3774,3896
37,"For one whole year he is always awake, and the next he sleeps. ",3896,3959
38,"But if you wish to see the Flower Queen's daughter go up the second mountain: the Dragon's old mother lives there, and she has a ball every night, to which the Flower Queen's daughter goes regularly.' ",3959,4160
39,"So the Prince went up the second mountain, where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows. ",4160,4266
40,"He opened the big gate leading into the courtyard, and was just going to walk in, when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted? ",4266,4411
41,"The Prince replied, 'I have heard so much of the beauty and kindness of the Dragon's Mother, and would like to enter her service.' ",4411,4542
42,"This flattering speech pleased the dragons, and the eldest of them said, 'Well, you may come with me, and I will take you to the Mother Dragon.' ",4542,4687
43,"They entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls, all made of gold and diamonds. ",4687,4784
44,In the twelfth room they found the Mother Dragon seated on a diamond throne. ,4784,4861
45,"She was the ugliest woman under the sun, and, added to it all, she had three heads. ",4861,4945
46,"Her appearance was a great shock to the Prince, and so was her voice, which was like the croaking of many ravens. ",4945,5059
47,"She asked him, 'Why have you come here?' ",5059,5100
48,"The Prince answered at once, 'I have heard so much of your beauty and kindness, that I would very much like to enter your service.' ",5100,5232
49,"'Very well,' said the Mother Dragon; ",5232,5269
50," 'but if you wish to enter my service, you must first lead my mare out to the meadow and look after her for three days; ",5268,5388
51," but if you don't bring her home safely every evening, we will eat you up.' ",5387,5463
52,The Prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow. ,5463,5529
53,But no sooner had they reached the grass than she vanished. ,5529,5589
54,"The Prince sought for her in vain, and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate. ",5589,5702
55,"As he sat thus lost in thought, he noticed an eagle flying over his head. ",5702,5776
56,"Then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell, and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once. ",5776,5876
57,"In a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him, and the King of the Eagles sank at his feet. ",5876,5982
58,"'I know what you want of me,' the bird said. ",5982,6027
59,'You are looking for the Mother Dragon's mare who is galloping about among the clouds. ,6027,6114
60,"I will summon all the eagles of the air together, and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you.' ",6114,6220
61,And with these words the King of the Eagles flew away. ,6220,6275
62,"Towards evening the Prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air, and when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them. ",6275,6422
63,They sank at his feet on to the ground and gave the mare over to him. ,6422,6492
64,"Then the Prince rode home to the old Mother Dragon, who was full of wonder when she saw him, and said, 'You have succeeded to-day in looking after my mare, and as a reward you shall come to my ball to-night.' ",6492,6701
65,"She gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper, and led him to a big room where several young he-dragons and she-dragons were dancing together. ",6701,6851
66,"Here, too, was the Flower Queen's beautiful daughter. ",6851,6905
67,"Her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world, and her complexion was like lilies and roses. ",6905,7016
68,"As the Prince was dancing with her he managed to whisper in her ear, 'I have come to set you free!' ",7016,7116
69,"Then the beautiful girl said to him, 'If you succeed in bringing the mare back safely the third day, ask the Mother Dragon to give you a foal of the mare as a reward.' ",7116,7284
70,"The ball came to an end at midnight, and early next morning the Prince again led the Mother Dragon's mare out into the meadow. ",7284,7411
71,But again she vanished before his eyes. ,7411,7451
72,Then he took out his little bell and rang it twice. ,7451,7503
73,"In a moment the King of the Foxes stood before him and said: 'I know already what you want, and will summon all the foxes of the world together to find the mare who has hidden herself in a hill.' ",7503,7699
74,"With these words the King of the Foxes disappeared, and in the evening many thousand foxes brought the mare to the Prince. ",7699,7822
75,"Then he rode home to the Mother-Dragon, from whom he received this time a cloak made of silver, and again she led him to the ball-room. ",7822,7958
76,"The Flower Queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound, and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear: 'If you succeed again to-morrow, wait for me with the foal in the meadow. ",7958,8163
77,After the ball we will fly away together.' ,8163,8206
78,On the third day the Prince led the mare to the meadow again; ,8206,8268
79, but once more she vanished before his eyes. ,8267,8312
80,Then the Prince took out his little bell and rang it three times. ,8312,8378
81,"In a moment the King of the Fishes appeared, and said to him: 'I know quite well what you want me to do, and I will summon all the fishes of the sea together, and tell them to bring you back the mare, who is hiding herself in a river.' ",8378,8614
82,"Towards evening the mare was returned to him, and when he led her home to the Mother Dragon she said to him: 'You are a brave youth, and I will make you my body-servant. ",8614,8784
83,But what shall I give you as a reward to begin with?' ,8784,8838
84,"The Prince begged for a foal of the mare, which the Mother Dragon at once gave him, and over and above, a cloak made of gold, for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty. ",8838,9035
85,So in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak; ,9035,9098
86," but before the entertainment was over he slipped away, and went straight to the stables, where he mounted his foal and rode out into the meadow to wait for the Flower Queen's daughter. ",9097,9283
87,"Towards midnight the beautiful girl appeared, and placing her in front of him on his horse, the Prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the Flower Queen's dwelling. ",9283,9460
88,"But the dragons had noticed their flight, and woke their brother out of his year's sleep. ",9460,9550
89,"He flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened, and determined to lay siege to the Flower Queen's palace; ",9550,9670
90," but the Queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up round her dwelling, through which no one could force a way. ",9669,9801
91,"When the Flower Queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the Prince, she said to him: 'I will give my consent to your marriage gladly, but my daughter can only stay with you in summer. ",9801,9991
92,"In winter, when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow, she must come and live with me in my palace underground.' ",9991,10118
93,"The Prince consented to this, and led his beautiful bride home, where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence. ",10118,10243
94,"The young couple lived happily together till winter came, when the Flower Queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother. ",10243,10372
95,"In summer she returned to her husband, and their life of joy and happiness began again, and lasted till the approach of winter, when the Flower Queen's daughter went back again to her mother. ",10372,10564
96,"This coming and going continued all her life long, and in spite of it they always lived happily together.",10564,10670
