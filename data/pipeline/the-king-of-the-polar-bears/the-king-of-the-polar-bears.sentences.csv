0,The King of the Polar Bears lived among the icebergs in the far north country. ,0,79
1,He was old and monstrous big; ,79,109
2, he was wise and friendly to all who knew him. ,108,155
3,"His body was thickly covered with long, white hair that glistened like silver under the rays of the midnight sun. ",155,269
4,"His claws were strong and sharp, that he might walk safely over the smooth ice or grasp and tear the fishes and seals upon which he fed. ",269,406
5,"The seals were afraid when he drew near, and tried to avoid him; ",406,471
6," but the gulls, both white and gray, loved him because he left the remnants of his feasts for them to devour. ",470,580
7,"Often his subjects, the polar bears, came to him for advice when ill or in trouble; ",580,664
8," but they wisely kept away from his hunting grounds, lest they might interfere with his sport and arouse his anger. ",663,779
9,"The wolves, who sometimes came as far north as the icebergs, whispered among themselves that the King of the Polar Bears was either a magician or under the protection of a powerful fairy. ",779,967
10,For no earthly thing seemed able to harm him; ,967,1013
11," he never failed to secure plenty of food, and he grew bigger and stronger day by day and year by year. ",1012,1116
12,"Yet the time came when this monarch of the north met man, and his wisdom failed him. ",1116,1201
13,He came out of his cave among the icebergs one day and saw a boat moving through the strip of water which had been uncovered by the shifting of the summer ice. ,1201,1361
14,In the boat were men. ,1361,1383
15,"The great bear had never seen such creatures before, and therefore advanced toward the boat, sniffing the strange scent with aroused curiosity and wondering whether he might take them for friends or foes, food or carrion. ",1383,1605
16,"When the king came near the water's edge a man stood up in the boat and with a queer instrument made a loud ""bang!"" ",1605,1721
17,The polar bear felt a shock; ,1721,1750
18, his brain became numb; ,1749,1773
19, his thoughts deserted him; ,1772,1800
20, his great limbs shook and gave way beneath him and his body fell heavily upon the hard ice. ,1799,1892
21,That was all he remembered for a time. ,1892,1931
22,"When he awoke he was smarting with pain on every inch of his huge bulk, for the men had cut away his hide with its glorious white hair and carried it with them to a distant ship. ",1931,2110
23,"Above him circled thousands of his friends the gulls, wondering if their benefactor were really dead and it was proper to eat him. ",2110,2241
24,"But when they saw him raise his head and groan and tremble they knew he still lived, and one of them said to his comrades: ""The wolves were right. ",2241,2388
25,"The king is a great magician, for even men cannot kill him. ",2388,2448
26,But he suffers for lack of covering. ,2448,2485
27,"Let us repay his kindness to us by each giving him as many feathers as we can spare."" ",2485,2571
28,This idea pleased the gulls. ,2571,2600
29,"One after another they plucked with their beaks the softest feathers from under their wings, and, flying down, dropped then gently upon the body of the King of the Polar Bears. ",2600,2777
30,"Then they called to him in a chorus: ""Courage, friend! ",2777,2832
31,Our feathers are as soft and beautiful as your own shaggy hair. ,2832,2896
32,They will guard you from the cold winds and warm you while you sleep. ,2896,2966
33,"Have courage, then, and live!"" ",2966,2997
34,And the King of the Polar Bears had courage to bear his pain and lived and was strong again. ,2997,3090
35,The feathers grew as they had grown upon the bodies of the birds and covered him as his own hair had done. ,3090,3197
36,"Mostly they were pure white in color, but some from the gray gulls gave his majesty a slight mottled appearance. ",3197,3310
37,The rest of that summer and all through the six months of night the king left his icy cavern only to fish or catch seals for food. ,3310,3441
38,"He felt no shame at his feathery covering, but it was still strange to him, and he avoided meeting any of his brother bears. ",3441,3566
39,"During this period of retirement he thought much of the men who had harmed him, and remembered the way they had made the great ""bang!"" ",3566,3701
40,And he decided it was best to keep away from such fierce creatures. ,3701,3769
41,Thus he added to his store of wisdom. ,3769,3807
42,"When the moon fell away from the sky and the sun came to make the icebergs glitter with the gorgeous tintings of the rainbow, two of the polar bears arrived at the king's cavern to ask his advice about the hunting season. ",3807,4029
43,"But when they saw his great body covered with feathers instead of hair they began to laugh, and one said: ""Our mighty king has become a bird! ",4029,4171
44,"Who ever before heard of a feathered polar bear?"" ",4171,4221
45,Then the king gave way to wrath. ,4221,4254
46,He advanced upon them with deep growls and stately tread and with one blow of his monstrous paw stretched the mocker lifeless at his feet. ,4254,4393
47,The other ran away to his fellows and carried the news of the king's strange appearance. ,4393,4482
48,"The result was a meeting of all the polar bears upon a broad field of ice, where they talked gravely of the remarkable change that had come upon their monarch. ",4482,4642
49,"""He is, in reality, no longer a bear,"" said one; ",4642,4691
50," ""nor can he justly be called a bird. ",4690,4728
51,"But he is half bird and half bear, and so unfitted to remain our king."" ",4728,4800
52,"""Then who shall take his place?"" ",4800,4833
53,asked another. ,4833,4848
54,"""He who can fight the bird-bear and overcome him,"" answered an aged member of the group. ",4848,4937
55,"""Only the strongest is fit to rule our race."" ",4937,4983
56,"There was silence for a time, but at length a great bear moved to the front and said: ""I will fight him; ",4983,5088
57, I-Woof-the strongest of our race! ,5087,5122
58,"And I will be King of the Polar Bears."" ",5122,5162
59,"The others nodded assent, and dispatched a messenger to the king to say he must fight the great Woof and master him or resign his sovereignty. ",5162,5305
60,"""For a bear with feathers,"" added the messenger, ""is no bear at all, and the king we obey must resemble the rest of us."" ",5305,5426
61,"""I wear feathers because it pleases me,"" growled the king. ",5426,5485
62,"""Am I not a great magician? ",5485,5513
63,"But I will fight, nevertheless, and if Woof masters me he shall be king in my stead."" ",5513,5599
64,"Then he visited his friends, the gulls, who were even then feasting upon the dead bear, and told them of the coming battle. ",5599,5723
65,"""I shall conquer,"" he said, proudly. ",5723,5760
66,"""Yet my people are in the right, for only a hairy one like themselves can hope to command their obedience."" ",5760,5868
67,"The queen gull said: ""I met an eagle yesterday, which had made its escape from a big city of men. ",5868,5966
68,And the eagle told me he had seen a monstrous polar bear skin thrown over the back of a carriage that rolled along the street. ,5966,6093
69,"That skin must have been yours, oh king, and if you wish I will sent an hundred of my gulls to the city to bring it back to you."" ",6093,6223
70,"""Let them go!"" ",6223,6238
71,"said the king, gruffly. ",6238,6262
72,And the hundred gulls were soon flying rapidly southward. ,6262,6320
73,"For three days they flew straight as an arrow, until they came to scattered houses, to villages, and to cities. ",6320,6432
74,Then their search began. ,6432,6457
75,"The gulls were brave, and cunning, and wise. ",6457,6502
76,"Upon the fourth day they reached the great metropolis, and hovered over the streets until a carriage rolled along with a great white bear robe thrown over the back seat. ",6502,6672
77,Then the birds swooped down-the whole hundred of them-and seizing the skin in their beaks flew quickly away. ,6672,6781
78,They were late. ,6781,6797
79,"The king's great battle was upon the seventh day, and they must fly swiftly to reach the Polar regions by that time. ",6797,6914
80,Meanwhile the bird-bear was preparing for his fight. ,6914,6967
81,He sharpened his claws in the small crevasses of the ice. ,6967,7025
82,He caught a seal and tested his big yellow teeth by crunching its bones between them. ,7025,7111
83,And the queen gull set her band to pluming the king bear's feathers until they lay smoothly upon his body. ,7111,7218
84,"But every day they cast anxious glances into the southern sky, watching for the hundred gulls to bring back the king's own skin. ",7218,7347
85,"The seventh day came, and all the Polar bears in that region gathered around the king's cavern. ",7347,7443
86,"Among them was Woof, strong and confident of his success. ",7443,7501
87,"""The bird-bear's feathers will fly fast enough when I get my claws upon him!"" ",7501,7579
88,he boasted; ,7579,7591
89, and the others laughed and encouraged him. ,7590,7634
90,"The king was disappointed at not having recovered his skin, but he resolved to fight bravely without it. ",7634,7739
91,"He advanced from the opening of his cavern with a proud and kingly bearing, and when he faced his enemy he gave so terrible a growl that Woof's heart stopped beating for a moment, and he began to realize that a fight with the wise and mighty king of his race was no laughing matter. ",7739,8022
92,"After exchanging one or two heavy blows with his foe Woof's courage returned, and he determined to dishearten his adversary by bluster. ",8022,8158
93,"""Come nearer, bird-bear!"" ",8158,8184
94,he cried. ,8184,8194
95,"""Come nearer, that I may pluck your plumage!"" ",8194,8240
96,The defiance filled the king with rage. ,8240,8280
97,"He ruffled his feathers as a bird does, till he appeared to be twice his actual size, and then he strode forward and struck Woof so powerful a blow that his skull crackled like an egg-shell and he fell prone upon the ground. ",8280,8505
98,While the assembled bears stood looking with fear and wonder at their fallen champion the sky became darkened. ,8505,8616
99,An hundred gulls flew down from above and dripped upon the king's body a skin covered with pure white hair that glittered in the sun like silver. ,8616,8762
100,And behold! ,8762,8774
101,"the bears saw before them the well-known form of their wise and respected master, and with one accord they bowed their shaggy heads in homage to the mighty King of the Polar Bears.",8774,8955
