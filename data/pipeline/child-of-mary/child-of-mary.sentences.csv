0,"FAR, far from here, in a great forest, there once lived a poor couple. ",0,71
1,Heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter; ,71,124
2, but they were so poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened. ,123,207
3,So her father had to go forth to see whether he could not find a god-father to pay for the child's christening. ,207,319
4,All day long he went from one to another; ,319,361
5, but no one wanted to be the god-father. ,360,401
6,"Toward evening, as he was going home, he met a very lovely lady, who wore the most splendid clothes, and seemed most kind and friendly. ",401,537
7,"She offered to see that the child was christened, if she might be allowed to keep it afterward. ",537,633
8,The man replied that first he must ask his wife. ,633,682
9,"But when he reached home and asked her she gave him a flat ""no."" ",682,747
10,The following day the man set out again; ,747,788
11, but no one wanted to be the god-father if he had to pay for the christening himself. ,787,873
12,"No matter how hard the man begged, it was all of no avail. ",873,932
13,"When he went home that evening, he again met the lovely lady, who looked so gentle, and she made him the same offer as before. ",932,1059
14,"The man again told his wife what had happened to him, and added that if he could not find a god-father for his child the following day, they would probably have to let the lady take her, since she seemed to be so kind and friendly. ",1059,1291
15,"The man then went out for the third time, and found no god-father that day. ",1291,1367
16,"And so, when he once more met the friendly lady in the evening, he promised to let her have the child, if she would see that it was baptized. ",1367,1509
17,"The following morning the lady came to the man's hut, and with her two other men. ",1509,1591
18,"She then took the child and went to church with it, and it was baptized. ",1591,1664
19,"Then she took it with her, and the little girl remained with her for several years, and her foster-mother was always good and kind to her. ",1664,1803
20,"Now when the girl had grown old enough to make distinctions, and had acquired some sense, it chanced that her foster-mother once wished to take a journey. ",1803,1958
21,"""You may go into any room you wish,"" she said to the girl, ""only you are not to go into these three rooms,"" and then she set out on her journey. ",1958,2103
22,But the girl could not resist opening the door to the one room a little way-and swish! ,2103,2190
23,out flew a star. ,2190,2207
24,"When her foster-mother came home, she was much grieved to find that the star had flown out, and was so annoyed with her foster-child that she threatened to send her away. ",2207,2378
25,"But the girl pleaded and cried, until at last she was allowed to remain. ",2378,2451
26,"After a time the foster-mother wanted to take another journey, and she forbade the girl, above all, to go into the two rooms which, as yet, she had not entered. ",2451,2612
27,And the girl promised her that this time she would obey her. ,2612,2673
28,"But when she had been alone for some time, and had had all sorts of thoughts as to what there might be in the second room, she could no longer resist opening the second door a little way-and swish! ",2673,2871
29,out flew the moon. ,2871,2890
30,"When the foster-mother returned, and saw the moon had slipped out, she again grieved greatly, and told the girl she could keep her no longer, and that now she must go. ",2890,3058
31,"But when the girl again began to cry bitterly, and pleaded with such grace that it was impossible to deny her, she was once more allowed to remain. ",3058,3206
32,"After this the foster-mother wished to take another journey, and she told the girl, who was now more than half-grown, that she must take her request not to go, or even so much as peep into the third room, seriously to heart. ",3206,3431
33,"But when the foster-mother had been away for some time, and the girl was all alone and bored, she could at last resist no longer. ",3431,3561
34,"""O,"" thought she, ""how pleasant it would be to take a peep into that third room!"" ",3561,3643
35,"It is true, that at first she thought she would not do it, because of her foster-mother; ",3643,3732
36," yet when the thought returned to her, she could not hold back, after all; ",3731,3806
37, but decided that she should and must by all means take a peep. ,3805,3869
38,So she opened the door the least little bit and swish! ,3869,3924
39,out flew the sun. ,3924,3942
40,"When the foster-mother then returned, and saw that the sun had flown out, she grieved greatly, and told the girl that now she could positively stay with her no longer. ",3942,4110
41,The foster-daughter cried and pleaded even more touchingly than before; ,4110,4182
42, but all to no avail. ,4181,4203
43,"""No, I must now punish you,"" said the foster-mother. ",4203,4256
44,"""But you shall have your choice of either becoming the most beautiful of all maidens, without the power of speech, or the most homely, yet able to talk. ",4256,4409
45,"But you must leave this place."" ",4409,4441
46,"The girl said: ""Then I would rather be the most beautiful of maidens without the power of speech""and such she became, but from that time on she was dumb. ",4441,4595
47,"Now when the girl had left her foster-mother, and had wandered for a time, she came to a large, large wood, and no matter how far she went she could not reach its end. ",4595,4763
48,"When evening came, she climbed into a high tree that stood over a spring, and sat down in its branches to sleep. ",4763,4876
49,"Not far from it stood a king's castle, and early the next morning a serving-maid came from it, to get water from the spring for the prince's tea. ",4876,5022
50,"And when the serving-maid saw the lovely face in the spring, she thought it was her own. ",5022,5111
51,"At once she threw down her pail and ran back home holding her head high, and saying: ""If I am as beautiful as all that, I am too good to carry water in a pail!"" ",5111,5272
52,"Then another was sent to fetch water, but the same thing happened with her; ",5272,5348
53," she, too, came back and said she was far too handsome and too good to go to the spring and fetch water for the prince. ",5347,5467
54,"Then the prince went himself, for he wanted to see what it all meant. ",5467,5537
55,"And when he came to the spring, he also saw the picture, and at once looked up into the tree. ",5537,5631
56,And so he saw the lovely maiden who was seated among its branches. ,5631,5698
57,"He coaxed her down, took her back home with him, and nothing would do but that she must be his bride, because she was so beautiful. ",5698,5830
58,"But his mother, who was still living, objected: ""she cannot speak,"" said she, ""and, maybe, she belongs to the troll-folk."" ",5830,5953
59,But the prince would not be satisfied until he had won her. ,5953,6013
60,"When, after a time, heaven bestowed a child upon the queen, the prince set a strong guard about her. ",6013,6114
61,"But suddenly they all fell asleep, and her foster-mother came, cut the child's little finger, rubbed some of the blood over the mouth and hands of the queen, and said: ""Now you shall grieve just as I did when you let the star slip out!"" ",6114,6351
62,And with that she disappeared with the child. ,6351,6397
63,"When those whom the prince had set to keep guard opened their eyes again, they thought that the queen had devoured her child, and the old queen wanted to have her burned; ",6397,6568
64," but the prince loved her so very tenderly, that after much pleading he succeeded in having her saved from punishment, though only with the greatest difficulty. ",6567,6728
65,"When heaven gave her a second child, a guard of twice as many men as had first stood watch was again set about her. ",6728,6844
66,"Yet everything happened as before, only that this time the foster-mother said to her: ""Now you shall grieve as I did when you let the moon slip out!"" ",6844,6994
67,The queen wept and pleaded-for when the foster-mother was there she could speak-but without avail. ,6994,7093
68,Now the old queen insisted that she be burned. ,7093,7140
69,But the prince once more succeeded in begging her free. ,7140,7196
70,"When heaven gave her a third child, a three-fold guard was set about her. ",7196,7270
71,"The foster-mother came while the guard slept, took the child, cut its little finger, and rubbed some of the blood on the queen's mouth. ",7270,7406
72,"""Now,"" said she, ""you shall grieve just as I did when you let the sun slip out!"" ",7406,7487
73,"And now the prince could in no way save her, she was to be and should be burned. ",7487,7568
74,"But at the very moment when they were leading her to the stake, the foster-mother appeared with all three children; ",7568,7684
75," the two older ones she led by the hand, the youngest she carried on her arm. ",7683,7761
76,"She stepped up to the young queen and said: ""Here are your children, for now I give them back to you. ",7761,7863
77,"I am the Virgin Mary, and the grief that you have felt is the same grief that I felt aforetimes, when you had let the star, the moon and the sun slip out. ",7863,8018
78,"Now you have been punished for that which you did, and from now on the power of speech is restored to you!"" ",8018,8126
79,"The happiness which then filled the prince and princess may be imagined, but cannot be described. ",8126,8224
80,"They lived happily together ever after, and from that time forward even the prince's mother was very fond of the young queen.",8224,8350
