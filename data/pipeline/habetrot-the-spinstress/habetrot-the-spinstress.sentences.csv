0,"In byegone days, in an old farmhouse which stood by a river, there lived a beautiful girl called Maisie. ",0,105
1,"She was tall and straight, with auburn hair and blue eyes, and she was the prettiest girl in all the valley. ",105,214
2,And one would have thought that she would have been the pride of her mother's heart. ,214,299
3,"But, instead of this, her mother used to sigh and shake her head whenever she looked at her. ",299,392
4,And why? ,392,401
5,"Because, in those days, all men were sensible; ",401,448
6," and instead of looking out for pretty girls to be their wives, they looked out for girls who could cook and spin, and who gave promise of becoming notable housewives. ",447,615
7,Maisie's mother had been an industrious spinster; ,615,665
8," but, alas! ",664,676
9,"to her sore grief and disappointment, her daughter did not take after her. ",676,751
10,"The girl loved to be out of doors, chasing butterflies and plucking wild flowers, far better than sitting at her spinning-wheel. ",751,880
11,"So when her mother saw one after another of Maisie's companions, who were not nearly so pretty as she was, getting rich husbands, she sighed and said: ""Woe's me, child, for methinks no brave wooer will ever pause at our door while they see thee so idle and thoughtless."" ",880,1151
12,But Maisie only laughed. ,1151,1176
13,"At last her mother grew really angry, and one bright Spring morning she laid down three heads of lint on the table, saying sharply, ""I will have no more of this dallying. ",1176,1347
14,People will say that it is my blame that no wooer comes to seek thee. ,1347,1417
15,"I cannot have thee left on my hands to be laughed at, as the idle maid who would not marry. ",1417,1509
16,So now thou must work; ,1509,1532
17," and if thou hast not these heads of lint spun into seven hanks of thread in three days, I will e'en speak to the Mother at St. Mary's Convent, and thou wilt go there and learn to be a nun."" ",1531,1722
18,"Now, though Maisie was an idle girl, she had no wish to be shut up in a nunnery; ",1722,1803
19," so she tried not to think of the sunshine outside, but sat down soberly with her distaff. ",1802,1893
20,"But, alas! ",1893,1904
21,she was so little accustomed to work that she made but slow progress; ,1904,1974
22," and although she sat at the spinning-wheel all day, and never once went out of doors, she found at night that she had only spun half a hank of yarn. ",1973,2123
23,"The next day it was even worse, for her arms ached so much she could only work very slowly. ",2123,2215
24,That night she cried herself to sleep; ,2215,2254
25," and next morning, seeing that it was quite hopeless to expect to get her task finished, she threw down her distaff in despair, and ran out of doors. ",2253,2403
26,"Near the house was a deep dell, through which ran a tiny stream. ",2403,2468
27,"Maisie loved this dell, the flowers grew so abundantly there. ",2468,2530
28,"This morning she ran down to the edge of the stream, and seated herself on a large stone. ",2530,2620
29,"It was a glorious morning, the hazel trees were newly covered with leaves, and the branches nodded over her head, and showed like delicate tracery against the blue sky. ",2620,2789
30,"The primroses and sweet-scented violets peeped out from among the grass, and a little water wagtail came and perched on a stone in the middle of the stream, and bobbed up and down, till it seemed as if he were nodding to Maisie, and as if he were trying to say to her, ""Never mind, cheer up."" ",2789,3082
31,But the poor girl was in no mood that morning to enjoy the flowers and the birds. ,3082,3164
32,"Instead of watching them, as she generally did, she hid her face in her hands, and wondered what would become of her. ",3164,3282
33,"She rocked herself to and fro, as she thought how terrible it would be if her mother fulfilled her threat and shut her up in the Convent of St. Mary, with the grave, solemn-faced sisters, who seemed as if they had completely forgotten what it was like to be young, and run about in the sunshine, and laugh, and pick the fresh Spring flowers. ",3282,3624
34,"""Oh, I could not do it, I could not do it,"" she cried at last. ",3624,3687
35,"""It would kill me to be a nun."" ",3687,3719
36,"""And who wants to make a pretty wench like thee into a nun?"" ",3719,3780
37,"asked a queer, cracked voice quite close to her. ",3780,3829
38,"Maisie jumped up, and stood staring in front of her as if she had been moonstruck. ",3829,3912
39,"For, just across the stream from where she had been sitting, there was a curious boulder, with a round hole in the middle of it--for all the world like a big apple with the core taken out. ",3912,4101
40,Maisie knew it well; ,4101,4122
41," she had often sat upon it, and wondered how the funny hole came to be there. ",4121,4199
42,"It was no wonder that she stared, for, seated on this stone, was the queerest little old woman that she had ever seen in her life. ",4199,4330
43,"Indeed, had it not been for her silver hair, and the white mutch with the big frill that she wore on her head, Maisie would have taken her for a little girl, she wore such a very short skirt, only reaching down to her knees. ",4330,4555
44,"Her face, inside the frill of her cap, was round, and her cheeks were rosy, and she had little black eyes, which twinkled merrily as she looked at the startled maiden. ",4555,4723
45,"On her shoulders was a black and white checked shawl, and on her legs, which she dangled over the edge of the boulder, she wore black silk stockings and the neatest little shoes, with great silver buckles. ",4723,4929
46,"In fact, she would have been quite a pretty old lady had it not been for her lips, which were very long and very thick, and made her look quite ugly in spite of her rosy cheeks and black eyes. ",4929,5122
47,Maisie stood and looked at her for such a long time in silence that she repeated her question. ,5122,5217
48,"""And who wants to make a pretty wench like thee into a nun?""",3719,3779
49,"More likely that some gallant gentleman should want to make a bride of thee."" ",5277,5355
50,"""Oh, no,"" answered Maisie, ""my mother says no gentleman would look at me because I cannot spin."" ",5355,5452
51,"""Nonsense,"" said the tiny woman. ",5452,5485
52,"""Spinning is all very well for old folks like me--my lips, as thou seest, are long and ugly because I have spun so much, for I always wet my fingers with them, the easier to draw the thread from the distaff. ",5485,5693
53,"No, no, take care of thy beauty, child; ",5693,5733
54," do not waste it over the spinning-wheel, nor yet in a nunnery."" ",5732,5797
55,"""If my mother only thought as thou dost,"" replied the girl sadly; ",5797,5863
56," and, encouraged by the old woman's kindly face, she told her the whole story. ",5862,5941
57,"""Well,"" said the old Dame, ""I do not like to see pretty girls weep; ",5941,6009
58," what if I were able to help thee, and spin the lint for thee?"" ",6008,6072
59,Maisie thought that this offer was too good to be true; ,6072,6128
60, but her new friend bade her run home and fetch the lint; ,6127,6185
61, and I need not tell you that she required no second bidding. ,6184,6246
62,"When she returned she handed the bundle to the little lady, and was about to ask her where she should meet her in order to get the thread from her when it was spun, when a sudden noise behind her made her look round. ",6246,6463
63,She saw nothing; ,6463,6480
64," but what was her horror and surprise when she turned back again, to find that the old woman had vanished entirely, lint and all. ",6479,6609
65,"She rubbed her eyes, and looked all round, but she was nowhere to be seen. ",6609,6684
66,The girl was utterly bewildered. ,6684,6717
67,"She wondered if she could have been dreaming, but no that could not be, there were her footprints leading up the bank and down again, where she had gone for the lint, and brought it back, and there was the mark of her foot, wet with dew, on a stone in the middle of the stream, where she had stood when she had handed the lint up to the mysterious little stranger. ",6717,7082
68,What was she to do now? ,7082,7106
69,"What would her mother say when, in addition to not having finished the task that had been given her, she had to confess to having lost the greater part of the lint also? ",7106,7276
70,"She ran up and down the little dell, hunting amongst the bushes, and peeping into every nook and cranny of the bank where the little old woman might have hidden herself. ",7276,7446
71,It was all in vain; ,7446,7466
72," and at last, tired out with the search, she sat down on the stone once more, and presently fell fast asleep. ",7465,7575
73,When she awoke it was evening. ,7575,7606
74,"The sun had set, and the yellow glow on the western horizon was fast giving place to the silvery light of the moon. ",7606,7722
75,"She was sitting thinking of the curious events of the day, and gazing at the great boulder opposite, when it seemed to her as if a distant murmur of voices came from it. ",7722,7892
76,"With one bound she crossed the stream, and clambered on to the stone. ",7892,7962
77,She was right. ,7962,7977
78,"Someone was talking underneath it, far down in the ground. ",7977,8036
79,"She put her ear close to the stone, and listened. ",8036,8086
80,The voice of the queer little old woman came up through the hole. ,8086,8152
81,"""Ho, ho, my pretty little wench little knows that my name is Habetrot."" ",8152,8224
82,"Full of curiosity, Maisie put her eye to the opening, and the strangest sight that she had ever seen met her gaze. ",8224,8339
83,She seemed to be looking through a telescope into a wonderful little valley. ,8339,8416
84,"The trees there were brighter and greener than any that she had ever seen before and there were beautiful flowers, quite different from the flowers that grew in her country. ",8416,8590
85,"The little valley was carpeted with the most exquisite moss, and up and down it walked her tiny friend, busily engaged in spinning. ",8590,8722
86,"She was not alone, for round her were a circle of other little old women, who were seated on large white stones, and they were all spinning away as fast as they could. ",8722,8890
87,"Occasionally one would look up, and then Maisie saw that they all seemed to have the same long, thick lips that her friend had. ",8890,9018
88,"She really felt very sorry, as they all looked exceedingly kind, and might have been pretty had it not been for this defect. ",9018,9143
89,"One of the Spinstresses sat by herself, and was engaged in winding the thread, which the others had spun, into hanks. ",9143,9261
90,Maisie did not think that this little lady looked so nice as the others. ,9261,9334
91,"She was dressed entirely in grey, and had a big hooked nose, and great horn spectacles. ",9334,9422
92,"She seemed to be called Slantlie Mab, for Maisie heard Habetrot address her by that name, telling her to make haste and tie up all the thread, for it was getting late, and it was time that the young girl had it to carry home to her mother. ",9422,9662
93,"Maisie did not quite know what to do, or how she was to get the thread, for she did not like to shout down the hole in case the queer little old woman should be angry at being watched. ",9662,9847
94,"However, Habetrot, as she had called herself, suddenly appeared on the path beside her, with the hanks of thread in her hand. ",9847,9973
95,"""Oh, thank you, thank you,"" cried Maisie. ",9973,10015
96,"""What can I do to show you how thankful I am?"" ",10015,10062
97,"""Nothing,"" answered the Fairy. ",10062,10093
98,"""For I do not work for reward. ",10093,10124
99,"Only do not tell your mother who span the thread for thee."" ",10124,10184
100,"It was now late, and Maisie lost no time in running home with the precious thread upon her shoulder. ",10184,10285
101,When she walked into the kitchen she found that her mother had gone to bed. ,10285,10361
102,"She seemed to have had a busy day, for there, hanging up in the wide chimney, in order to dry, were seven large black puddings. ",10361,10489
103,"The fire was low, but bright and clear; ",10489,10529
104," and the sight of it and the sight of the puddings suggested to Maisie that she was very hungry, and that fried black puddings were very good. ",10528,10671
105,"Flinging the thread down on the table, she hastily pulled off her shoes, so as not to make a noise and awake her mother; ",10671,10792
106," and, getting down the frying-pan from the wall, she took one of the black puddings from the chimney, and fried it, and ate it. ",10791,10919
107,"Still she felt hungry, so she took another, and then another, till they were all gone. ",10919,11006
108,Then she crept upstairs to her little bed and fell fast asleep. ,11006,11070
109,Next morning her mother came downstairs before Maisie was awake. ,11070,11135
110,"In fact, she had not been able to sleep much for thinking of her daughter's careless ways, and had been sorrowfully making up her mind that she must lose no time in speaking to the Abbess of St. Mary's about this idle girl of hers. ",11135,11367
111,"What was her surprise to see on the table the seven beautiful hanks of thread, while, on going to the chimney to take down a black pudding to fry for breakfast, she found that every one of them had been eaten. ",11367,11577
112,"She did not know whether to laugh for joy that her daughter had been so industrious, or to cry for vexation because all her lovely black puddings--which she had expected would last for a week at least--were gone. ",11577,11790
113,"In her bewilderment she sang out: ""My daughter's spun se'en, se'en, se'en, My daughter's eaten se'en, se'en, se'en, And all before daylight."" ",11790,11932
114,"Now I forgot to tell you that, about half a mile from where the old farmhouse stood, there was a beautiful Castle, where a very rich young nobleman lived. ",11932,12087
115,"He was both good and brave, as well as rich; ",12087,12132
116," and all the mothers who had pretty daughters used to wish that he would come their way, some day, and fall in love with one of them. ",12131,12265
117,"But he had never done so, and everyone said, ""He is too grand to marry any country girl. ",12265,12354
118,"One day he will go away to London Town and marry a Duke's daughter."" ",12354,12423
119,"Well, this fine spring morning it chanced that this young nobleman's favourite horse had lost a shoe, and he was so afraid that any of the grooms might ride it along the hard road, and not on the soft grass at the side, that he said that he would take it to the smithy himself. ",12423,12701
120,So it happened that he was riding along by Maisie's garden gate as her mother came into the garden singing these strange lines. ,12701,12829
121,"He stopped his horse, and said good-naturedly, ""Good day, Madam; ",12829,12894
122," and may I ask why you sing such a strange song?"" ",12893,12943
123,"Maisie's mother made no answer, but turned and walked into the house; ",12943,13013
124," and the young nobleman, being very anxious to know what it all meant, hung his bridle over the garden gate, and followed her. ",13012,13139
125,"She pointed to the seven hanks of thread lying on the table, and said, ""This hath my daughter done before breakfast."" ",13139,13257
126,"Then the young man asked to see the Maiden who was so industrious, and her mother went and pulled Maisie from behind the door, where she had hidden herself when the stranger came in; ",13257,13440
127, for she had come downstairs while her mother was in the garden. ,13439,13504
128,"She looked so lovely in her fresh morning gown of blue gingham, with her auburn hair curling softly round her brow, and her face all over blushes at the sight of such a gallant young man, that he quite lost his heart, and fell in love with her on the spot. ",13504,13761
129,"""Ah,"" said he, ""my dear mother always told me to try and find a wife who was both pretty and useful, and I have succeeded beyond my expectations. ",13761,13907
130,"Do not let our marriage, I pray thee, good Dame, be too long deferred."" ",13907,13979
131,"Maisie's mother was overjoyed, as you may imagine, at this piece of unexpected good fortune, and busied herself in getting everything ready for the wedding; ",13979,14136
132, but Maisie herself was a little perplexed. ,14135,14179
133,"She was afraid that she would be expected to spin a great deal when she was married and lived at the Castle, and if that were so, her husband was sure to find out that she was not really such a good spinstress as he thought she was. ",14179,14412
134,"In her trouble she went down, the night before her wedding, to the great boulder by the stream in the glen, and, climbing up on it, she laid her head against the stone, and called softly down the hole, ""Habetrot, dear Habetrot."" ",14412,14641
135,"The little old woman soon appeared, and, with twinkling eyes, asked her what was troubling her so much just when she should have been so happy. ",14641,14785
136,And Maisie told her. ,14785,14806
137,"""Trouble not thy pretty head about that,"" answered the Fairy, ""but come here with thy bridegroom next week, when the moon is full, and I warrant that he will never ask thee to sit at a spinning-wheel again."" ",14806,15014
138,"Accordingly, after all the wedding festivities were over and the couple had settled down at the Castle, on the appointed evening Maisie suggested to her husband that they should take a walk together in the moonlight. ",15014,15231
139,She was very anxious to see what the little Fairy would do to help her; ,15231,15303
140," for that very day he had been showing her all over her new home, and he had pointed out to her the beautiful new spinning-wheel made of ebony, which had belonged to his mother, saying proudly, ""To-morrow, little one, I shall bring some lint from the town, and then the maids will see what clever little fingers my wife has."" ",15302,15628
141,"Maisie had blushed as red as a rose as she bent over the lovely wheel, and then felt quite sick, as she wondered whatever she would do if Habetrot did not help her. ",15628,15793
142,"So on this particular evening, after they had walked in the garden, she said that she should like to go down to the little dell and see how the stream looked by moonlight. ",15793,15965
143,So to the dell they went. ,15965,15991
144,"As soon as they came to the boulder Maisie put her head against it and whispered, ""Habetrot, dear Habetrot"";",15991,16099
145, and in an instant the little old woman appeared. ,16099,16149
146,"She bowed in a stately way, as if they were both strangers to her, and said, ""Welcome, Sir and Madam, to the Spinsters' Dell."" ",16149,16276
147,"And then she tapped on the root of a great oak tree with a tiny wand which she held in her hand, and a green door, which Maisie never remembered having noticed before, flew open, and they followed the Fairy through it into the other valley which Maisie had seen through the hole in the great stone. ",16276,16575
148,"All the little old women were sitting on their white chucky stones busy at work, only they seemed far uglier than they had seemed at first; ",16575,16715
149," and Maisie noticed that the reason for this was, that, instead of wearing red skirts and white mutches as they had done before, they now wore caps and dresses of dull grey, and instead of looking happy, they all seemed to be trying who could look most miserable, and who could push out their long lips furthest, as they wet their fingers to draw the thread from their distaffs. ",16714,17093
150,"""Save us and help us! ",17093,17115
151,"What a lot of hideous old witches,"" exclaimed her husband. ",17115,17174
152,"""Whatever could this funny old woman mean by bringing a pretty child like thee to look at them? ",17174,17270
153,Thou wilt dream of them for a week and a day. ,17270,17316
154,"Just look at their lips"";",17316,17341
155," and, pushing Maisie behind him, he went up to one of them and asked her what had made her mouth grow so ugly. ",17341,17452
156,"She tried to tell him, but all the sound that he could hear was something that sounded like SPIN-N-N. ",17452,17554
157,"He asked another one, and her answer sounded like this: SPAN-N-N. ",17554,17620
158,"He tried a third, and hers sounded like SPUN-N-N. ",17620,17670
159,He seized Maisie by the hand and hurried her through the green door. ,17670,17739
160,"""By my troth,"" he said, ""my mother's spinning-wheel may turn to gold ere I let thee touch it, if this is what spinning leads to. ",17739,17868
161,"Rather than that thy pretty face should be spoilt, the linen chests at the Castle may get empty, and remain so for ever!"" ",17868,17990
162,"So it came to pass that Maisie could be out of doors all day wandering about with her husband, and laughing and singing to her heart's content. ",17990,18134
163,"And whenever there was lint at the Castle to be spun, it was carried down to the big boulder in the dell and left there, and Habetrot and her companions spun it, and there was no more trouble about the matter.",18134,18344
