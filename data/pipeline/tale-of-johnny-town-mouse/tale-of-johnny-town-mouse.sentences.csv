0,Johnny Town-mouse was born in a cupboard. ,0,42
1,Timmy Willie was born in a garden. ,42,77
2,Timmy Willie was a little country mouse who went to town by mistake in a hamper. ,77,158
3,The gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier; ,158,219
4, he packed them in a big hamper. ,218,251
5,"The gardener left the hamper by the garden gate, so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed. ",251,353
6,"Timmy Willie crept in through a hole in the wicker-work, and after eating some peas-Timmy Willie fell fast asleep. ",353,468
7,"He awoke in a fright, while the hamper was being lifted into the carrier's cart. ",468,549
8,"Then there was a jolting, and a clattering of horse's feet; ",549,609
9, other packages were thrown in; ,608,640
10, for miles and miles-jolt-jolt-jolt! ,639,676
11,and Timmy Willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables. ,676,737
12,"At last the cart stopped at a house, where the hamper was taken out, carried in, and set down. ",737,832
13,The cook gave the carrier sixpence; ,832,868
14," the back door banged, and the cart rumbled away. ",867,917
15,But there was no quiet; ,917,941
16, there seemed to be hundreds of carts passing. ,940,987
17,Dogs barked; ,987,1000
18, boys whistled in the street; ,999,1029
19," the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down-stairs; ",1028,1088
20, and a canary sang like a steam engine. ,1087,1127
21,"Timmy Willie, who had lived all his life in a garden, was almost frightened to death. ",1127,1213
22,Presently the cook opened the hamper and began to unpack the vegetables. ,1213,1286
23,Out sprang the terrified Timmy Willie. ,1286,1325
24,"Up jumped the cook on a chair, exclaiming ""A mouse! ",1325,1377
25,a mouse! ,1377,1386
26,Call the cat! ,1386,1400
27,"Fetch me the poker, Sarah!"" ",1400,1428
28,Timmy Willie did not wait for Sarah with the poker; ,1428,1480
29," he rushed along the skirting board till he came to a little hole, and in he popped. ",1479,1564
30,"He dropped half a foot, and crashed into the middle of a mouse dinner party, breaking three glasses.-""Who in the world is this?"" ",1564,1693
31,inquired Johnny Town-mouse. ,1693,1721
32,But after the first exclamation of surprise he instantly recovered his manners. ,1721,1801
33,"With the utmost politeness he introduced Timmy Willie to nine other mice, all with long tails and white neckties. ",1801,1915
34,Timmy Willie's own tail was insignificant. ,1915,1958
35,Johnny Town-mouse and his friends noticed it; ,1958,2004
36, but they were too well bred to make personal remarks; ,2003,2058
37, only one of them asked Timmy Willie if he had ever been in a trap? ,2057,2125
38,The dinner was of eight courses; ,2125,2158
39," not much of anything, but truly elegant. ",2157,2199
40,"All the dishes were unknown to Timmy Willie, who would have been a little afraid of tasting them; ",2199,2297
41," only he was very hungry, and very anxious to behave with company manners. ",2296,2371
42,"The continual noise upstairs made him so nervous, that he dropped a plate. ",2371,2446
43,"""Never mind, they don't belong to us,"" said Johnny. ",2446,2498
44,"""Why don't those youngsters come back with the dessert?"" ",2498,2555
45,"It should be explained that two young mice, who were waiting on the others, went skirmishing upstairs to the kitchen between courses. ",2555,2689
46,"Several times they had come tumbling in, squeaking and laughing; ",2689,2754
47, Timmy Willie learnt with horror that they were being chased by the cat. ,2753,2826
48,"His appetite failed, he felt faint. ",2826,2862
49,"""Try some jelly?"" ",2862,2880
50,said Johnny Town-mouse. ,2880,2904
51,"""No? ",2904,2909
52,Would you rather go to bed? ,2909,2937
53,"I will show you a most comfortable sofa pillow."" ",2937,2986
54,The sofa pillow had a hole in it. ,2986,3020
55,"Johnny Town-mouse quite honestly recommended it as the best bed, kept exclusively for visitors. ",3020,3116
56,But the sofa smelt of cat. ,3116,3143
57,Timmy Willie preferred to spend a miserable night under the fender. ,3143,3211
58,It was just the same next day. ,3211,3242
59,An excellent breakfast was provided-for mice accustomed to eat bacon; ,3242,3312
60, but Timmy Willie had been reared on roots and salad. ,3311,3365
61,"Johnny Town-mouse and his friends racketted about under the floors, and came boldly out all over the house in the evening. ",3365,3488
62,One particularly loud crash had been caused by Sarah tumbling downstairs with the tea-tray; ,3488,3580
63," there were crumbs and sugar and smears of jam to be collected, in spite of the cat. ",3579,3664
64,Timmy Willie longed to be at home in his peaceful nest in a sunny bank. ,3664,3736
65,The food disagreed with him; ,3736,3765
66, the noise prevented him from sleeping. ,3764,3804
67,"In a few days he grew so thin that Johnny Town-mouse noticed it, and questioned him. ",3804,3889
68,He listened to Timmy Willie's story and inquired about the garden. ,3889,3956
69,"""It sounds rather a dull place? ",3956,3988
70,"What do you do when it rains?"" ",3988,4019
71,"""When it rains, I sit in my little sandy burrow and shell corn and seeds from my Autumn store. ",4019,4114
72,"I peep out at the throstles and blackbirds on the lawn, and my friend Cock Robin. ",4114,4196
73,"And when the sun comes out again, you should see my garden and the flowers-roses and pinks and pansies-no noise except the birds and bees, and the lambs in the meadows."" ",4196,4366
74,"""There goes that cat again!"" ",4366,4395
75,exclaimed Johnny Town-mouse. ,4395,4424
76,When they had taken refuge in the coal-cellar he resumed the conversation; ,4424,4499
77," ""I confess I am a little disappointed; ",4498,4538
78," we have endeavoured to entertain you, Timothy William."" ",4537,4594
79,"""Oh yes, yes, you have been most kind; ",4594,4633
80," but I do feel so ill,"" said Timmy Willie. ",4632,4675
81,"""It may be that your teeth and digestion are unaccustomed to our food; ",4675,4746
82," perhaps it might be wiser for you to return in the hamper."" ",4745,4806
83,"""Oh? ",4806,4811
84,"Oh!"" ",4811,4816
85,cried Timmy Willie. ,4816,4836
86,"""Why of course for the matter of that we could have sent you back last week,"" said Johnny rather huffily-""did you not know that the hamper goes back empty on Saturdays?"" ",4836,5006
87,"So Timmy Willie said good-bye to his new friends, and hid in the hamper with a crumb of cake and a withered cabbage leaf; ",5006,5128
88," and after much jolting, he was set down safely in his own garden. ",5127,5194
89,"Sometimes on Saturdays he went to look at the hamper lying by the gate, but he knew better than to get in again. ",5194,5307
90,"And nobody got out, though Johnny Town-mouse had half promised a visit. ",5307,5379
91,The winter passed; ,5379,5398
92, the sun came out again; ,5397,5422
93, Timmy Willie sat by his burrow warming his little fur coat and sniffing the smell of violets and spring grass. ,5421,5533
94,He had nearly forgotten his visit to town. ,5533,5576
95,When up the sandy path all spick and span with a brown leather bag came Johnny Town-mouse! ,5576,5667
96,Timmy Willie received him with open arms. ,5667,5709
97,"""You have come at the best of all the year, we will have herb pudding and sit in the sun."" ",5709,5800
98,"""H'm'm! ",5800,5808
99,"it is a little damp,"" said Johnny Town-mouse, who was carrying his tail under his arm, out of the mud. ",5808,5911
100,"""What is that fearful noise?"" ",5911,5941
101,he started violently. ,5941,5963
102,"""That?"" ",5963,5971
103,"said Timmy Willie, ""that is only a cow; ",5971,6011
104," I will beg a little milk, they are quite harmless, unless they happen to lie down upon you. ",6010,6103
105,"How are all our friends?"" ",6103,6129
106,Johnny's account was rather middling. ,6129,6167
107,He explained why he was paying his visit so early in the season; ,6167,6232
108, the family had gone to the sea-side for Easter; ,6231,6280
109," the cook was doing spring cleaning, on board wages, with particular instructions to clear out the mice. ",6279,6384
110,"There were four kittens, and the cat had killed the canary. ",6384,6444
111,"""They say we did it; ",6444,6465
112," but I know better,"" said Johnny Town-mouse. ",6464,6509
113,"""Whatever is that fearful racket?"" ",6509,6544
114,"""That is only the lawn-mower; ",6544,6574
115, I will fetch some of the grass clippings presently to make your bed. ,6573,6643
116,"I am sure you had better settle in the country, Johnny."" ",6643,6700
117,"""H'm'm-we shall see by Tuesday week; ",6700,6737
118," the hamper is stopped while they are at the sea-side."" ",6736,6792
119,"""I am sure you will never want to live in town again,"" said Timmy Willie. ",6792,6866
120,But he did. ,6866,6878
121,He went back in the very next hamper of vegetables; ,6878,6930
122, he said it was too quiet!! ,6929,6957
123,"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. ",6957,7021
124,"For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie.",7021,7085
