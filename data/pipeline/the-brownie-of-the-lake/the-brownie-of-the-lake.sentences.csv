0,Once upon a time there lived in France a man whose name was Jalm Riou. ,0,71
1,"You might have walked a whole day without meeting anyone happier or more contented, for he had a large farm, plenty of money, and above all, a daughter called Barbaik, the most graceful dancer and the best-dressed girl in the whole country side. ",71,317
2,"When she appeared on holidays in her embroidered cap, five petticoats, each one a little shorter than the other, and shoes with silver buckles, the women were all filled with envy, but little cared Barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and that she had more partners than any other girl. ",317,682
3,"Now amongst all the young men who wanted to marry Barbaik, the one whose heart was most set on her was her father's head man, but as his manners were rough and he was exceedingly ugly she would have nothing to say to him, and, what was worse, often made fun of him with the rest. ",682,962
4,"Jegu, for that was his name, of course heard of this, and it made him very unhappy. ",962,1046
5,"Still he would not leave the farm, and look for work elsewhere, as he might have done, for then he would never see Barbaik at all, and what was life worth to him without that? ",1046,1222
6,"One evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields, and stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink. ",1222,1347
7,"He was tired with a long day's work, and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals, waiting till they had done, and thinking all the while of Barbaik, when a voice came out of the gorse close by. ",1347,1555
8,"'What is the matter, Jegu? ",1555,1582
9,You mustn't despair yet.' ,1582,1608
10,"The young man glanced up in surprise, and asked who was there. ",1608,1671
11,"'It is I, the brownie of the lake,' replied the voice. ",1671,1726
12,'But where are you?' ,1726,1747
13,inquired Jegu.',1747,1762
14,"'Look close, and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog. ",1761,1846
15,"I can take,' he added proudly, 'any shape I choose, and even, which is much harder, be invisible if I want to.' ",1846,1958
16,"'Then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear,' replied Jegu. ",1958,2051
17,"'Certainly, if you wish,' and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses, and changed into a little dwarf, all dressed in green. ",2051,2186
18,"This transformation rather frightened Jegu, but the brownie bade him have no fears, for he would not do him any harm; ",2186,2304
19," indeed, he hoped that Jegu might find him of some use. ",2303,2359
20,'But why should you take all this interest in me?' ,2359,2410
21,asked the peasant suspiciously. ,2410,2442
22,"'Because of a service you did me last winter, which I have never forgotten,' answered the little fellow. ",2442,2547
23,"'You know, I am sure, that the korigans who dwell in the White Corn country have declared war on my people, because they say that they are the friends of man. ",2547,2706
24,"We were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant lands, and to hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes. ",2706,2827
25,"Since that time, partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves, we have continued to transform ourselves, and it was in this way that I got to know you.' ",2827,2983
26,'How?' ,2983,2990
27,"exclaimed Jegu, filled with astonishment. ",2990,3032
28,"'Do you remember when you were digging in the field near the river, three months ago, you found a robin redbreast caught in a net?' ",3032,3164
29,"'Yes,' answered Jegu, 'I remember it very well, and I opened the net and let him go.' ",3164,3250
30,"'Well, I was that robin redbreast, and ever since I have vowed to be your friend, and as you want to marry Barbaik, I will prove the truth of what I say by helping you to do so.' ",3250,3429
31,'Ah! ,3429,3434
32,"my little brownie, if you can do that, there is nothing I won't give you, except my soul.' ",3434,3525
33,"'Then let me alone,' rejoined the dwarf, 'and I promise you that in a very few months you shall be master of the farm and of Barbaik.' ",3525,3660
34,'But how are you going to do it?' ,3660,3694
35,exclaimed Jegu wonderingly. ,3694,3722
36,'That is my affair. ,3722,3742
37,Perhaps I may tell you later. ,3742,3772
38,"Meanwhile you just eat and sleep, and don't worry yourself about anything.' ",3772,3848
39,"Jegu declared that nothing could be easier, and then taking off his hat, he thanked the dwarf heartily, and led his horses back to the farm. ",3848,3989
40,"Next morning was a holiday, and Barbaik was awake earlier than usual, as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible, and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off. ",3989,4192
41,"She went first to the cow-house, which it was her duty to keep clean, but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down, the racks filled with hay, the cows milked, and the pails standing neatly in a row. ",4192,4399
42,"'Of course, Jegu must have done this in the hope of my giving him a dance,' she thought to herself, and when she met him outside the door she stopped and thanked him for his help. ",4399,4579
43,"To be sure, Jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about, but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else. ",4579,4748
44,"The same thing took place every day, and never had the cow-house been so clean nor the cows so fat. ",4748,4848
45,"Morning and evening Barbaik found her earthen pots full of milk and a pound of butter freshly churned, ornamented with leaves. ",4848,4975
46,At the end of a few weeks she grew so used to this state of affairs that she only got up just in time to prepare breakfast. ,4975,5099
47,"Soon even this grew to be unnecessary, for a day arrived when, coming downstairs, she discovered that the house was swept, the furniture polished, the fire lit, and the food ready, so that she had nothing to do except to ring the great bell which summoned the labourers from the fields to come and eat it. ",5099,5405
48,"This, also, she thought was the work of Jegu, and she could not help feeling that a husband of this sort would be very useful to a girl who liked to lie in bed and to amuse herself. ",5405,5587
49,"Indeed, Barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied. ",5587,5654
50,"If the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoilt, she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly, 'I should like my churns to be full, and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry,' and she need never give another thought to the matter. ",5654,5973
51,"If she found the rye bread too hard to bake, or the oven taking too long to heat, she just murmured, 'I should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bread box,' and two hours after there they were. ",5973,6182
52,"If she was too lazy to walk all the way to market along a dirty road, she would say out loud the night before, 'Why am I not already back from Morlaix with my milk pot empty, my butter bowl inside it, a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate, and the money I have gained in my apron pocket?' ",6182,6477
53,"and in the morning when she got up, lo and behold! ",6477,6528
54,"there were standing at the foot of her bed the empty milk pot with the butter bowl inside, the black cherries on the wooden plate, and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron. ",6528,6716
55,"And she believed that all this was owing to Jegu, and she could no longer do without him, even in her thoughts. ",6716,6828
56,"When things had reached this pass, the brownie told the young man that he had better ask Barbaik to marry him, and this time the girl did not turn rudely away, but listened patiently to the end. ",6828,7023
57,"In her eyes he was as ugly and awkward as ever, but he would certainly make a most useful husband, and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time, just like a young lady, and as for the rest of the day, it would not be half long enough for all she meant to do. ",7023,7291
58,"She would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them, and visit her neighbours, who would be dying of envy all the while, and she would be able to dance as much as she wished. ",7291,7486
59,"Jegu would always be there to work for her and save for her, and watch over her. ",7486,7567
60,"So, like a well-brought-up girl, Barbaik answered that it should be as her father pleased, knowing quite well that old Riou had often said that after he was dead there was no one so capable of carrying on the farm. ",7567,7782
61,"The marriage took place the following month, and a few days later the old man died quite suddenly. ",7782,7881
62,"Now Jegu had everything to see to himself, and somehow it did not seem so easy as when the farmer was alive. ",7881,7990
63,"But once more the brownie stepped in, and was better than ten labourers. ",7990,8063
64,"It was he who ploughed and sowed and reaped, and if, as happened, occasionally, it was needful to get the work done quickly, the brownie called in some of his friends, and as soon as it was light a host of little dwarfs might have been seen in the fields, busy with hoe, fork or sickle. ",8063,8350
65,"But by the time the people were about all was finished, and the little fellows had disappeared. ",8350,8446
66,And all the payment the brownie ever asked for was a bowl of broth. ,8446,8514
67,From the very day of her marriage Barbaik had noted with surprise and rage that things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the weeks and months before. ,8514,8682
68,"She complained to Jegu of his laziness, and he only stared at her, not understanding what she was talking about. ",8682,8795
69,"But the brownie, who was standing by, burst out laughing, and confessed that all the good offices she spoke of had been performed by him, for the sake of Jegu, but that now he had other business to do, and it was high time that she looked after her house herself. ",8795,9059
70,Barbaik was furious. ,9059,9080
71,"Each morning when she was obliged to get up before dawn to milk the cows and go to market, and each evening when she had to sit up till midnight in order to churn the butter, her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease and pleasure. ",9080,9364
72,"But when she looked at Jegu and beheld his red face, squinting eyes, and untidy hair, her anger was doubled. ",9364,9473
73,"'If it had not been for you, you miserable dwarf!' ",9473,9524
74,"she would say between her teeth, 'if it had not been for you I should never have married that man, and I should still have been going to dances, where the young men would have brought me present of nuts and cherries, and told me that I was the prettiest girl in the parish. ",9524,9798
75,While now I can receive no presents except from my husband. ,9798,9858
76,"I can never dance, except with my husband. ",9858,9901
77,"Oh, you wretched dwarf, I will never, never forgive you!' ",9901,9959
78,"In spite of her fierce words, no one knew better than Barbaik how to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her, and after receiving an invitation to a wedding, she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there. ",9959,10181
79,"To her great joy he consented, bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted. ",10181,10301
80,"Full of excitement, Barbaik started on her journey. ",10301,10353
81,"It was not long, and when she reached the town she went straight to the dwarfs, who were holding counsel in a wide green place, and said to them, 'Listen, my friends! ",10353,10520
82,"I have come to beg you to lend me a black horse, with eyes, a mouth, ears, bridle and saddle.' ",10520,10615
83,"She had hardly spoken when the horse appeared, and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held. ",10615,10749
84,"At first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work which she hated, that she noticed nothing, but very soon it struck her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all laughed as they looked at her horse. ",10749,10996
85,At length she caught some words uttered by one man to another. ,10996,11059
86,"'Why, the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail!' ",11059,11111
87,and turned in her saddle. ,11111,11137
88,Yes; ,11137,11142
89, it was true. ,11141,11155
90,Her horse had no tail! ,11155,11178
91,"She had forgotten to ask for one, and the wicked dwarfs had carried out her orders to the letter! ",11178,11276
92,"'Well, at any rate, I shall soon be there,' she thought, and shaking the reins, tried to urge the horse to a gallop. ",11276,11393
93,But it was of no use; ,11393,11415
94, he declined to move out of a walk; ,11414,11450
95, and she was forced to hear all the jokes that were made upon her. ,11449,11516
96,"In the evening she returned to the farm more angry than ever, and quite determined to revenge herself on the brownie whenever she had the chance, which happened to be very soon. ",11516,11694
97,"It was the spring, and just the time of year when the dwarfs held their fete, so one day the brownie asked Jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn, and whether he would allow them to dance there. ",11694,11918
98,"Of course, Jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie, and he ordered Barbaik to spread her best table-cloths in the barn, and to make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes, and, besides, to keep all the milk given by the cows that morning. ",11918,12187
99,"He expected she would refuse, as he knew she hated the dwarfs, but she said nothing, and prepared the supper as he had bidden her. ",12187,12318
100,"When all was ready, the dwarfs, in new green suits, came bustling in, very happy and merry, and took their seats at the table. ",12318,12445
101,"But in a moment they all sprang up with a cry, and ran away screaming, for Barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet, and all their poor little toes were burnt.'",12445,12618
102,"'You won't forget that in a hurry,' she said, smiling grimly to herself, but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water, which they poured on the fire. ",12617,12784
103,"Then they joined hands and danced round it, singing: Wicked traitress, Barne Riou, Our poor toes are burned by you; ",12784,12900
104, Now we hurry from your hall-- Bad luck light upon you all. ,12899,12959
105,"That evening they left the country for ever, and Jegu, without their help, grew poorer and poorer, and at last died of misery, while Barbaik was glad to find work in the market of Morlaix.",12959,13148
