0,A mother sat there with her little child. ,0,42
1,"She was so downcast, so afraid that it should die! ",42,93
2,"It was so pale, the small eyes had closed themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a deep respiration, as if it sighed. ",93,237
3,The mother looked still more sorrowfully on the little creature. ,237,302
4,"Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one. ",302,424
5,"He needed it, as it was the cold winter season! ",424,472
6,"Everything out-of-doors was covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face. ",472,570
7,"As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment, the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove, that it might be warm for him. ",570,745
8,"The old man sat and rocked the cradle, and the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little hand. ",745,927
9,"""Do you not think that I shall save him?"" ",927,969
10,said she. ,969,979
11,"""Our Lord will not take him from me!"" ",979,1017
12,"And the old man--it was Death himself--he nodded so strangely, it could just as well signify yes as no. ",1017,1121
13,"And the mother looked down in her lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks. ",1121,1200
14,Her head became so heavy--she had not closed her eyes for three days and nights. ,1200,1281
15,"Now she slept, but only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold. ",1281,1363
16,"""What is that?"" ",1363,1379
17,"said she, and looked on all sides. ",1379,1414
18,"But the old man was gone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him. ",1414,1497
19,"The old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight ran down to the floor, bump! ",1497,1598
20,and then the clock also stood still. ,1598,1635
21,But the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child. ,1635,1707
22,"Out there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black clothes. ",1707,1786
23,"She said, ""Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him hasten away with thy little child. ",1786,1877
24,"He goes faster than the wind, and he never brings back what he takes!"" ",1877,1948
25,"""Oh, only tell me which way he went!"" ",1948,1986
26,said the mother. ,1986,2003
27,"""Tell me the way, and I shall find him!"" ",2003,2044
28,"""I know it!"" ",2044,2057
29,said the woman in the black clothes. ,2057,2094
30,"""But before I tell it, thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child! ",2094,2189
31,I am fond of them. ,2189,2208
32,I have heard them before. ,2208,2234
33,I am Night. ,2234,2246
34,"I saw thy tears whilst thou sang'st them!"" ",2246,2289
35,"""I will sing them all, all!"" ",2289,2318
36,said the mother. ,1986,2003
37,"""But do not stop me now--I may overtake him--I may find my child!"" ",2335,2402
38,But Night stood still and mute. ,2402,2434
39,"Then the mother wrung her hands, sang and wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears. ",2434,2534
40,"Then Night said, ""Go to the right, into the dark pine forest. ",2534,2596
41,"Go to where I saw Death take his way with thy little child!"" ",2596,2657
42,"The roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no longer knew whither she should go! ",2657,2761
43,then there stood a thorn-bush. ,2761,2792
44,"There was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter season, and ice-flakes hung on the branches. ",2792,2909
45,"""Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?"" ",2909,2966
46,said the mother. ,1986,2003
47,"""Yes,"" said the thorn-bush. ",2983,3011
48,"""But I will not tell thee which way he took, unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. ",3011,3104
49,I am freezing to death. ,3104,3128
50,"I shall become a lump of ice!"" ",3128,3159
51,"And she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might be thoroughly warmed. ",3159,3252
52,"The thorns went right into her flesh, and her blood flowed in large drops, but the thornbush shot forth fresh green leaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart of the afflicted mother was so warm. ",3252,3478
53,The thorn-bush told her the way she should go. ,3478,3525
54,"She then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat. ",3525,3595
55,The lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her. ,3595,3645
56,"Neither was it open, nor low enough that she could wade through it. ",3645,3713
57,Across it she must go if she would find her child! ,3713,3764
58,"Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and that was an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother thought that a miracle might happen nevertheless. ",3764,3928
59,"""Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!"" ",3928,3977
60,said the weeping mother. ,3977,4002
61,"She wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of the waters, and became two precious pearls. ",4002,4107
62,"But the water bore her up, as if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore on the opposite side. ",4107,4229
63,"There stood a mile-broad, strange house, one knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were built up. ",4229,4355
64,But the poor mother could not see it. ,4355,4393
65,She had wept her eyes out. ,4393,4420
66,"""Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?"" ",4420,4479
67,said she. ,969,979
68,"""He has not come here yet!"" ",4489,4517
69,"said the old grave woman, who was appointed to look after Death's great greenhouse! ",4517,4601
70,"""How have you been able to find the way hither? ",4601,4649
71,"And who has helped you?"" ",4649,4674
72,"""OUR LORD has helped me,"" said she. ",4674,4710
73,"""He is merciful, and you will also be so! ",4710,4752
74,"Where shall I find my little child?"" ",4752,4789
75,"""Nay, I know not,"" said the woman, ""and you cannot see! ",4789,4845
76,Many flowers and trees have withered this night. ,4845,4894
77,Death will soon come and plant them over again! ,4894,4942
78,"You certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree or flower, just as everyone happens to be settled. ",4942,5057
79,"They look like other plants, but they have pulsations of the heart. ",5057,5125
80,Children's hearts can also beat. ,5125,5158
81,"Go after yours, perhaps you may know your child's. ",5158,5209
82,"But what will you give me if I tell you what you shall do more?"" ",5209,5274
83,"""I have nothing to give,"" said the afflicted mother, ""but I will go to the world's end for you!"" ",5274,5371
84,"""Nay, I have nothing to do there!"" ",5371,5406
85,said the woman. ,5406,5422
86,"""But you can give me your long black hair. ",5422,5465
87,"You know yourself that it is fine, and that I like! ",5465,5517
88,"You shall have my white hair instead, and that's always something!"" ",5517,5585
89,"""Do you demand nothing else?"" ",5585,5615
90,said she. ,969,979
91,"""That I will gladly give you!"" ",5625,5656
92,"And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's snow-white hair instead. ",5656,5743
93,"So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees grew strangely into one another. ",5743,5844
94,"There stood fine hyacinths under glass bells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; ",5844,5930
95," there grew water plants, some so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them, and black crabs pinched their stalks. ",5929,6061
96,"There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and plantains. ",6061,6116
97,There stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every flower had its name. ,6116,6199
98,"Each of them was a human life, the human frame still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about in the world. ",6199,6325
99,"There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots. ",6325,6433
100,"In other places, there was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it, and it was so petted and nursed. ",6433,6555
101,"But the distressed mother bent down over all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart beat. ",6555,6669
102,Amongst millions she knew her child's. ,6669,6708
103,"""There it is!"" ",6708,6723
104,"cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side. ",6723,6825
105,"""Don't touch the flower!"" ",6825,6851
106,said the old woman. ,6851,6871
107,"""But place yourself here, and when Death comes--I expect him every moment--do not let him pluck the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the others. ",6871,7042
108,Then he will be afraid! ,7042,7066
109,"He is responsible for them to OUR LORD, and no one dares to pluck them up before HE gives leave."" ",7066,7164
110,"All at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall, and the blind mother could feel that it was Death that came. ",7164,7280
111,"""How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?"" ",7280,7330
112,he asked. ,7330,7340
113,"""How couldst thou come quicker than I?"" ",7340,7380
114,"""I am a mother,"" said she. ",7380,7407
115,"And Death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower, but she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that she should touch one of the leaves. ",7407,7583
116,"Then Death blew on her hands, and she felt that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell down powerless. ",7583,7700
117,"""Thou canst not do anything against me!"" ",7700,7741
118,said Death. ,7741,7753
119,"""But OUR LORD can!"" ",7753,7773
120,said she. ,969,979
121,"""I only do His bidding!"" ",7783,7808
122,said Death. ,7741,7753
123,"""I am His gardener, I take all His flowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise, in the unknown land; ",7820,7947
124," but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare not tell thee."" ",7946,8015
125,"""Give me back my child!"" ",8015,8040
126,"said the mother, and she wept and prayed. ",8040,8082
127,"At once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand, and cried out to Death, ""I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in despair."" ",8082,8237
128,"""Touch them not!"" ",8237,8255
129,said Death. ,7741,7753
130,"""Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy, and now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy."" ",8267,8362
131,"""Another mother!"" ",8362,8380
132,"said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold of both the flowers. ",8380,8451
133,"""There, thou hast thine eyes,"" said Death; ",8451,8494
134," ""I fished them up from the lake, they shone so bright; ",8493,8549
135, I knew not they were thine. ,8548,8577
136,"Take them again, they are now brighter than before; ",8577,8629
137, now look down into the deep well close by; ,8628,8672
138," I shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst have torn up, and thou wilt see their whole future life--their whole human existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy."" ",8671,8872
139,And she looked down into the well; ,8872,8907
140," and it was a happiness to see how the one became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy were felt everywhere. ",8906,9037
141,"And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow and distress, horror, and wretchedness. ",9037,9125
142,"""Both of them are God's will!"" ",9125,9156
143,said Death. ,7741,7753
144,"""Which of them is Misfortune's flower and which is that of Happiness?"" ",9168,9239
145,asked she. ,9239,9250
146,"""That I will not tell thee,"" said Death; ",9250,9291
147," ""but this thou shalt know from me, that the one flower was thy own child! ",9290,9365
148,"it was thy child's fate thou saw'st--thy own child's future life!"" ",9365,9432
149,"Then the mother screamed with terror, ""Which of them was my child? ",9432,9499
150,Tell it me! ,9499,9511
151,Save the innocent! ,9511,9530
152,Save my child from all that misery! ,9530,9566
153,Rather take it away! ,9566,9587
154,Take it into God's kingdom! ,9587,9615
155,"Forget my tears, forget my prayers, and all that I have done!"" ",9615,9678
156,"""I do not understand thee!"" ",9678,9706
157,said Death. ,7741,7753
158,"""Wilt thou have thy child again, or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!"" ",9718,9807
159,"Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our Lord: ""Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the best! ",9807,9949
160,hear me not! ,9949,9962
161,"hear me not!"" ",9962,9976
162,"And she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and went with it into the unknown land.",9976,10081
