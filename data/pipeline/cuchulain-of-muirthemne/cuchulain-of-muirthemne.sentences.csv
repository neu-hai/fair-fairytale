0,"In the long time ago, Conchubar, son of Ness, was King of Ulster, and he held his court in the palace of Emain Macha. ",0,118
1,And this is the way he came to be King. ,118,158
2,"He was but a young lad, and his father was not living. ",158,213
3,"Fergus, son of Rogh, who was at that time King of Ulster, asked his mother Ness in marriage. ",213,306
4,"Now Ness, that was at one time the quietest and kindest of the women of Ireland, had got to be unkind and treacherous because of an unkindness that had been done to her. ",306,476
5,She planned to get the kingdom away from Fergus for her own son. ,476,541
6,"So she said to Fergus, ""Let Conchubar hold the kingdom for a year, so that his children after him may be called the children of a king. ",541,677
7,"That is the marriage portion I will ask of you."" ",677,726
8,"""You may do that,"" the men of Ulster said to him. ",726,776
9,"""For even though Conchubar gets the name of being king, it is yourself that will be our King all the time."" ",776,884
10,"So Fergus agreed to it, and he took Ness as his wife, and her son Conchubar was made King in his place. ",884,988
11,But all through the year Ness was working to keep the kingdom for him. ,988,1059
12,She gave great presents to the chief men of Ulster to get them on her side. ,1059,1135
13,"And though Conchubar was but a young lad at the time, he was wise in his judgments and brave in battle, and good in shape and in form. ",1135,1270
14,They liked him well. ,1270,1291
15,"And at the end of the year, when Fergus asked to have the kingship back again, they consulted together. ",1291,1395
16,"It is what they agreed, that Conchubar was to keep it. ",1395,1450
17,"And they said, ""It is little Fergus thinks about us, when he was so ready to give up his rule over us for a year. ",1450,1564
18,"Let Conchubar keep the kingship,"" they said, ""and let Fergus keep the wife he has got."" ",1564,1652
19,"Now, it happened one day that Conchubar was making a feast at Emain Macha for the marriage of his sister Dechtire with Sualtim, son of Roig. ",1652,1793
20,"And at the feast Dechtire was thirsty, and they gave her a cup of wine, and as she was drinking it a mayfly flew into the cup, and she drank it down with the wine. ",1793,1957
21,"And presently she went into her sunny parlour, and her fifty maidens along with her, and she fell into a deep sleep. ",1957,2074
22,"And in her sleep Lugh of the Long Hand appeared to her, and he said, ""It is I myself was the mayfly that came to you in the cup, and it is with me you must come away now, and your fifty maidens along with you."" ",2074,2285
23,And he put on them the appearance of a flock of birds. ,2285,2340
24,"They went with him southward till they came to Brugh na Boinne, the dwelling-place of the Sidhe. ",2340,2437
25,"And no one at Emain Macha could get tale or tidings of them, or know where they had gone, or what had happened them. ",2437,2554
26,"It was about a year after that time there was another feast in Emain, and Conchubar and his chief men were sitting at the feast. ",2554,2683
27,"And suddenly they saw from the window a great flock of birds, that lit on the ground and began to eat up everything before them, so that not so much as a blade of grass was left. ",2683,2862
28,"The men of Ulster were vexed when they saw the birds destroying all before them, and they yoked nine of their chariots to follow after them. ",2862,3003
29,"Conchubar was in his own chariot, and there were following with him Fergus, son of Rogh, and Laegaire Buadach the Battle-Winner, and Celthair, son of Uithecar, and many others, and Bricriu of the bitter tongue was along with them. ",3003,3234
30,"They followed after the birds across the whole country southward, across Slieve Fuad, by Ath Lethan, by Ath Garach and Magh Gossa, between Fir Rois and Fir Ardae. ",3234,3397
31,The birds before them always. ,3397,3427
32,They were the most beautiful that had ever been seen. ,3427,3481
33,"Nine flocks of them there were, linked together two-and-two with a chain of silver, and at the head of every flock there were two birds of different colours, linked together with a chain of gold. ",3481,3677
34,"and There were three birds that flew by themselves, and they all went before the chariots to the far end of the country, until the fall of night, and then there was no more seen of them. ",3677,3864
35,"And when the dark night was coming on, Conchubar said to his people, ""It is best for us to unyoke the chariots now, and to look for some place where we can spend the night."" ",3864,4038
36,"Then Fergus went forward to look for some place, and what he came to was a very small poor-looking house. ",4038,4144
37,"A man and a woman were in it, and when they saw him they said, ""Bring your companions here along with you, and they will be welcome."" ",4144,4278
38,Fergus went back to his companions and told them what he had seen. ,4278,4345
39,"But Bricriu said: ""Where is the use of going into a house like that, with neither room nor provisions nor coverings in it. ",4345,4468
40,"It is not worth our while to be going there."" ",4468,4514
41,Then Bricriu went on himself to the place where the house was. ,4514,4577
42,"But when he came to it, what he saw was a grand, new, well-lighted house. ",4577,4651
43,"At the door there was a young man wearing armour, very tall and handsome and shining. ",4651,4737
44,"And he said, ""Come into the house, Bricriu. ",4737,4781
45,"Why are you looking about you?"" ",4781,4813
46,"And there was a young woman beside him, fine and noble, and with curled hair, and she said, ""Surely there is a welcome before you from me."" ",4813,4953
47,"""Why does she welcome me?"" ",4953,4980
48,said Bricriu. ,4980,4994
49,"""It is on account of her that I myself welcome you,"" said the young man. ",4994,5067
50,"""And is there no one missing from you at Emain?"" ",5067,5116
51,he said. ,5116,5125
52,"""There is, surely,"" said Bricriu. ",5125,5159
53,"""We are missing fifty young girls for the length of a year."" ",5159,5220
54,"""Would you know them again if you saw them?"" ",5220,5265
55,said the young man. ,5047,5067
56,"""If I would not know them,"" said Bricriu, ""it is because a year might make a change in them, so that I would not be sure."" ",5285,5408
57,"""Try and know them again,"" said the man, ""for the fifty young girls are in this house, and this woman beside me is their mistress, Dechtire. ",5408,5549
58,"It was they themselves, changed into birds, that went to Emain Macha to bring you here."" ",5549,5638
59,Then Dechtire gave Bricriu a purple cloak with gold fringes. ,5638,5699
60,He went back to find his companions. ,5699,5736
61,"But while he was going he thought to himself, ""Conchubar would give great treasure to find these fifty young girls again, and his sister along with them. ",5736,5890
62,I will not tell him I have found them. ,5890,5929
63,"I will only say I have found a house with beautiful women in it, and no more than that."" ",5929,6018
64,When Conchubar saw Bricriu he asked news of him. ,6018,6067
65,"""What news do you bring back with you, Bricriu?"" ",6067,6116
66,he said. ,5116,5125
67,"""I came to a fine well-lighted house,"" said Bricriu. ",6125,6178
68,"""I saw a queen, noble, kind, with royal looks, with curled hair. ",6178,6243
69,"I saw a troop of women, beautiful, well dressed. ",6243,6292
70,"I saw the man of the house, tall and open-handed and shining."" ",6292,6355
71,"""Let us go there for the night,"" said Conchubar. ",6355,6404
72,So they brought their chariots and their horses and their arms. ,6404,6468
73,"They were hardly in the house when every sort of food and of drink, some they knew and some they did not know, was put before them, so that they never spent a better night. ",6468,6641
74,"And when they had eaten and drunk and began to be satisfied, Conchubar said to the young man, ""Where is the mistress of the house that she does not come to bid us welcome?"" ",6641,6814
75,"""You cannot see her to-night,"" said he, ""for she is in the pains of childbirth."" ",6814,6895
76,"So they rested there that night, and in the morning Conchubar was the first to rise up. ",6895,6983
77,"He saw no more of the man of the house, and what he heard was the cry of a child. ",6983,7065
78,"And he went to the room it came from, and there he saw Dechtire, and her maidens about her, and a young child beside her. ",7065,7187
79,"And she bade Conchubar welcome, and she told him all that had happened her, and that she had called him there to bring herself and the child back to Emain Macha. ",7187,7349
80,"And Conchubar said, ""It is well you have done by me, Dechtire. ",7349,7412
81,You gave shelter to me and to my chariots. ,7412,7455
82,You kept the cold from my horses. ,7455,7489
83,"You gave food to me and my people, and now you have given us this good gift. ",7489,7566
84,"And let our sister, Finchoem, bring up the child,"" he said. ",7566,7626
85,"""No, it is not for her to bring him up, it is for me,"" said Sencha, son of Ailell, chief judge and chief poet of Ulster. ",7626,7747
86,"""For I am skilled. ",7747,7766
87,I am good in disputes. ,7766,7789
88,I am not forgetful. ,7789,7809
89,I speak before anyone at all in the presence of the King. ,7809,7867
90,I watch over what he says. ,7867,7894
91,I give judgment in the quarrels of kings. ,7894,7936
92,I am judge of the men of Ulster. ,7936,7969
93,"no one has a right to dispute my claim, but only Conchubar."" ",7969,8030
94,"""If the child is given to me to bring up,"" said Blai, the distributor, ""he will not suffer from want of care or from forgetfulness. ",8030,8162
95,It is my messages that do the will of Conchubar. ,8162,8211
96,I call up the fighting men from all Ireland. ,8211,8256
97,"I am well able to provide for them for a week, or even for ten days. ",8256,8325
98,I settle their business and their disputes. ,8325,8369
99,I support their honour. ,8369,8393
100,"I get satisfaction for their insults."" ",8393,8432
101,"""You think too much of yourself,"" said Fergus. ",8432,8479
102,"""It is I that will bring up the child. ",8479,8518
103,I am strong. ,8518,8531
104,I have knowledge. ,8531,8549
105,I am the King's messenger. ,8549,8576
106,no one can stand up against me in honour or riches. ,8576,8628
107,I am hardened to war and battles. ,8628,8662
108,I am a good craftsman. ,8662,8685
109,I am worthy to bring up the child. ,8685,8720
110,I am the protector of all the unhappy. ,8720,8759
111,The strong are afraid of me. ,8759,8788
112,"I am the helper of the weak."" ",8788,8818
113,"""If you will listen to me at last, now you are quiet,"" said Amergin, ""I am able to bring up a child like a king. ",8818,8931
114,"The people praise my honour, my bravery, my courage, my wisdom. ",8931,8995
115,"They praise my good luck, my age, my speaking, my name, my courage, and my race. ",8995,9076
116,"Though I am a fighter, I am a poet. ",9076,9112
117,I am worthy of the King's favour. ,9112,9146
118,I overcome all the men who fight from their chariots. ,9146,9200
119,I owe thanks to no one except Conchubar. ,9200,9241
120,"I obey no one but the King."" ",9241,9270
121,"Then Sencha said, ""Let Finchoem keep the child until we come to Emain, and Morann, the judge, will settle the question when we are there."" ",9270,9409
122,"So the men of Ulster set out for Emain, Finchoem having the child with her. ",9409,9485
123,And when they came there Morann gave his judgment. ,9485,9536
124,"""It is for Conchubar,"" he said, ""to help the child to a good name, for he is next of kin to him. ",9536,9633
125,Let Sencha teach him words and speaking. ,9633,9674
126,Let Fergus hold him on his knees. ,9674,9708
127,"Let Amergin be his tutor."" ",9708,9735
128,"And he said, ""This child will be praised by all, by chariot drivers and fighters, by kings and by wise men. ",9735,9843
129,He shall be loved by many men. ,9843,9874
130,He will avenge all your wrongs. ,9874,9906
131,He will defend your fords. ,9906,9933
132,"He will fight all your battles."" ",9933,9966
133,And so it was settled. ,9966,9989
134,And the child was left until he should come to sensible years with his mother Dechtire and with her husband Sualtim. ,9989,10106
135,"And they brought him up upon the plain of Muirthemne, and the name he was known by was Setanta, son of Sualtim.",10106,10218
