0,"There was once a little boy whose name was Lars, and because he was so little he was called Little Lasse; ",0,106
1," he was a brave little man, for he sailed round the world in a pea-shell boat. ",105,184
2,"It was summer time, when the pea shells grew long and green in the garden. ",184,259
3,"Little Lasse crept into the pea bed where the pea stalks rose high above his cap, and he picked seventeen large shells, the longest and straightest he could find. ",259,422
4,"Little Lasse thought, perhaps, that no one saw him; ",422,474
5," but that was foolish, for God sees everywhere. ",473,521
6,"Then the gardener came with his gun over his shoulder, and he heard something rustling in the pea bed. ",521,624
7,"'I think that must be a sparrow,' he said. ",624,667
8,'Ras! ,667,673
9,Ras!' ,673,679
10,"but no sparrows flew out, for Little Lasse had no wings, only two small legs. ",679,757
11,'Wait! ,757,764
12,"I will load my gun and shoot the sparrows,' said the gardener. ",764,827
13,"Then Little Lasse was frightened, and crept out on to the path. ",827,891
14,"'Forgive me, dear gardener!' ",891,920
15,he said. ,658,667
16,'I wanted to get some fine boats.' ,929,964
17,"'Well, I will this time,' said the gardener. ",964,1009
18,'But another time Little Lasse must ask leave to go and look for boats in the pea bed.' ,1009,1097
19,"'I will,' answered Lasse; ",1097,1123
20, and he went off to the shore. ,1122,1153
21,"Then he opened the shells with a pin, split them carefully in two, and broke small little bits of sticks for the rowers' seats. ",1153,1281
22,Then he took the peas which were in the shells and put them in the boats for cargo. ,1281,1365
23,"Some of the shells got broken, some remained whole, and when all were ready Lasse had twelve boats. ",1365,1465
24,"But they should not be boats, they should be large warships. ",1465,1526
25,"He had three liners, three frigates, three brigs and three schooners. ",1526,1596
26,"The largest liner was called Hercules, and the smallest schooner The Flea. ",1596,1671
27,"Little Lasse put all the twelve into the water, and they floated as splendidly and as proudly as any great ships over the waves of the ocean. ",1671,1813
28,And now the ships must sail round the world. ,1813,1858
29,The great island over there was Asia; ,1858,1896
30, that large stone Africa; ,1895,1921
31, the little island America; ,1920,1948
32, the small stones were Polynesia; ,1947,1981
33, and the shore from which the ships sailed out was Europe. ,1980,2039
34,The whole fleet set off and sailed far away to other parts of the world. ,2039,2112
35,"The ships of the line steered a straight course to Asia, the frigates sailed to Africa, the brigs to America, and the schooners to Polynesia. ",2112,2254
36,"But Little Lasse remained in Europe, and threw small stones out into the great sea. ",2254,2338
37,"Now, there was on the shore of Europe a real boat, father's own, a beautiful white-painted boat, and Little Lasse got into it. ",2338,2465
38,"Father and mother had forbidden this, but Little Lasse forgot. ",2465,2528
39,He thought he should very much like to travel to some other part of the world. ,2528,2607
40,"'I shall row out a little way--only a very little way,' he thought. ",2607,2675
41,The pea-shell boats had travelled so far that they only looked like little specks on the ocean. ,2675,2771
42,"'I shall seize Hercules on the coast of Asia,' said Lasse, 'and then row home again to Europe.' ",2771,2867
43,"He shook the rope that held the boat, and, strange to say, the rope became loose. ",2867,2949
44,"Ditsch, ratsch, a man is a man, and so Little Lasse manned the boat. ",2949,3018
45,"Now he would row--and he could row, for he had rowed so often on the step sat home, when the steps pretended to be a boat and father's big stick an oar. ",3018,3171
46,But when Little Lasse wanted to row there were no oars to be found in the boat. ,3171,3251
47,"The oars were locked up in the boat-house, and Little Lasse had not noticed that the boat was empty. ",3251,3352
48,It is not so easy as one thinks to row to Asia without oars. ,3352,3413
49,What could Little Lasse do now? ,3413,3445
50,"The boat was already some distance out on the sea, and the wind, which blew from land, was driving it still further out. ",3445,3566
51,Lasse was frightened and began to cry. ,3566,3605
52,But there was no one on the shore to hear him. ,3605,3652
53,Only a big crow perched alone in the birch tree; ,3652,3701
54," and the gardener's black cat sat under the birch tree, waiting to catch the crow. ",3700,3783
55,"Neither of them troubled themselves in the least about Little Lasse, who was drifting out to sea. ",3783,3881
56,Ah! ,3881,3885
57,"how sorry Little Lasse was now that he had been disobedient and got into the boat, when father and mother had so often forbidden him to do so! ",3885,4028
58,"Now it was too late, he could not get back to land. ",4028,4080
59,Perhaps he would be lost out on the great sea. ,4080,4127
60,What should he do? ,4127,4146
61,"When he had shouted until he was tired and no one heard him, he put his two little hands together and said, 'Good God, do not be angry with Little Lasse.' ",4146,4301
62,And then he went to sleep. ,4301,4328
63,"For although it was daylight, old Nukku Matti was sitting on the shores of the 'Land of Nod,' and was fishing for little children with his long fishing rod. ",4328,4485
64,"He heard the low words which Little Lasse said to God, and he immediately drew the boat to himself and laid Little Lasse to sleep on a bed of rose leaves. ",4485,4640
65,"Then Nukku Matti said to one of the Dreams, 'Play with Little Lasse, so that he does not feel lonesome.' ",4640,4745
66,"It was a little dream-boy, so little, so little, that he was less than Lasse himself; ",4745,4831
67," he had blue eyes and fair hair, a red cap with a silver band, and white coat with pearls on the collar. ",4830,4935
68,"He came to Little Lasse and said, 'Would you like to sail round the world?' ",4935,5011
69,"'Yes,' said Lasse in his sleep, 'I should like to.' ",5011,5063
70,"'Come, then,' said the dream-boy, 'and let us sail in your pea-shell boats. ",5063,5139
71,You shall sail in Hercules and I shall sail in The Flea.' ,5139,5197
72,"So they sailed away from the 'Land of Nod,' and in a little while Hercules and The Flea were on the shores of Asia away at the other end of the world, where the Ice Sea flows through Behring Straits into the Pacific Ocean. ",5197,5420
73,A long way off in the winter mist they could see the explorer Nordenskiold with his ship Vega trying to find an opening between the ice. ,5420,5557
74,"It was so cold, so cold; ",5557,5582
75," the great icebergs glittered strangely, and the huge whales now lived under the ice, for they could not make a hole through with their awkward heads. ",5581,5732
76,All around on the dreary shore there was snow and snow as far as the eye could see; ,5732,5816
77," little grey men in shaggy skins moved about, and drove in small sledges through the snow drifts, but the sledges were drawn by dogs. ",5815,5949
78,'Shall we land here?' ,5949,5971
79,asked the dream-boy. ,5971,5992
80,"'No,' said Little Lasse. ",5992,6017
81,"'I am so afraid that the whales would swallow us up, and the big dogs bite us. ",6017,6096
82,Let us sail instead to another part of the world.' ,6096,6147
83,"'Very well,' said the dream-boy with the red cap and the silver band; ",6147,6217
84, 'it is not far to America'--and at the same moment they were there. ,6216,6285
85,The sun was shining and it was very warm. ,6285,6327
86,Tall palm trees grew in long rows on the shore and bore coconuts in their top branches. ,6327,6415
87,"Men red as copper galloped over the immense green prairies and shot their arrows at the buffaloes, who turned against them with their sharp horns. ",6415,6562
88,An enormous cobra which had crept up the stem of a tall palm tree threw itself on to a little llama that was grazing at the foot. ,6562,6692
89,Knaps! ,6692,6699
90,it was all over the little llama. ,6699,6733
91,'Shall we land here?' ,5949,5971
92,asked the dream-boy. ,5971,5992
93,"'No,' said Little Lasse. ",5992,6017
94,"'I am so afraid that the buffaloes will butt us, and the great serpent eat us up. ",6801,6883
95,Let us travel to another part of the world.' ,6883,6928
96,"'Very well,' said the dream-boy with the white coat, 'it is only a little way to Polynesia'--and then they were there. ",6928,7047
97,"It was very warm there, as warm as in a hot bath in Finland. ",7047,7108
98,"Costly spices grew on the shores: the pepper plant, the cinnamon tree, ginger, saffron; ",7108,7196
99, the coffee plant and the tea plant. ,7195,7232
100,"Brown people with long ears and thick lips, and hideously painted faces, hunted a yellow-spotted tiger among the high bamboos on the shore, and the tiger turned on them and stuck its claws into one of the brown men. ",7232,7448
101,Then all the others took to flight. ,7448,7484
102,'Shall we land here?' ,5949,5971
103,asked the dream-boy. ,5971,5992
104,"'No,' said Little Lasse. ",5992,6017
105,'Don't you see the tiger away there by the pepper plant? ,7552,7609
106,Let us travel to another part of the world.' ,6883,6928
107,"'We can do so,' said the dream-boy with the blue eyes. ",7654,7709
108,'We are not far from Africa'--and as he said that they were there. ,7709,7776
109,They anchored at the mouth of a great river where the shores were as green as the greenest velvet. ,7776,7875
110,A little distance from the river an immense desert stretched away. ,7875,7942
111,The air was yellow; ,7942,7962
112," the sun shone so hot, so hot as if it would burn the earth to ashes, and the people were as black as the blackest jet. ",7961,8081
113,They rode across the desert on tall camels; ,8081,8125
114," the lions roared with thirst, and the great crocodiles with their grey lizard heads and sharp white teeth gaped up out of the river. ",8124,8258
115,'Shall we land here?' ,5949,5971
116,asked the dream-boy. ,5971,5992
117,"'No,' said Little Lasse. ",5992,6017
118,"'The sun would burn us, and the lions and the crocodiles would eat us up. ",8326,8400
119,Let us travel to another part of the world.' ,6883,6928
120,"'We can travel back to Europe,' said the dream-boy with the fair hair. ",8445,8516
121,And with that they were there. ,8516,8547
122,They came to a shore where it was all so cool and familiar and friendly. ,8547,8620
123,There stood the tall birch tree with its drooping leaves; ,8620,8678
124," at the top sat the old crow, and at its foot crept the gardener's black cat. ",8677,8755
125,Not far away was a house which Little Lasse had seen before; ,8755,8816
126," near the house there was a garden, and in the garden a pea bed with long pea shells. ",8815,8901
127,An old gardener with a green coat walked about and wondered if the cucumbers were ripe. ,8901,8989
128,"Fylax was barking on the steps, and when he saw Little Lasse he wagged his tail. ",8989,9070
129,"Old Stina was milking the cows in the farmyard, and there was a very familiar lady in a check woollen shawl on her way to the bleaching green to see if the clothes were bleached. ",9070,9249
130,"There was, too, a well-known gentleman in a yellow summer coat, with a long pipe in his mouth; ",9249,9344
131, he was going to see if the reapers had cut the rye. ,9343,9396
132,"A boy and a girl were running on the shore and calling out, 'Little Lasse! ",9396,9471
133,Come home for bread-and-butter!' ,9471,9504
134,'Shall we land here?' ,5949,5971
135,"asked the dream-boy, and he blinked his blue eyes roguishly. ",9526,9587
136,"'Come with me, and I shall ask mother to give you some bread-and-butter and a glass of milk,' said Little Lasse. ",9587,9700
137,"'Wait a little,' said the dream-boy. ",9700,9737
138,"And now Little Lasse saw that the kitchen door was open, and from within there was heard a low, pleasant frizzling, like that which is heard when one whisks yellow batter with a wooden ladle into a hot frying-pan. ",9737,9951
139,'Perhaps we should sail back to Polynesia now?' ,9951,9999
140,said the happy dream-boy. ,9999,10025
141,'No; ,10025,10030
142," they are frying pancakes in Europe just now,' said Little Lasse; ",10029,10095
143," and he wanted to jump ashore, but he could not. ",10094,10143
144,"The dream-boy had tied him with a chain of flowers, so that he could not move. ",10143,10222
145,"And now all the little dreams came about him, thousands and thousands of little children, and they made a ring around him and sang a little song: The world is very, very wide, Little Lasse, Lasse, And though you've sailed beyond the tide, You can never tell how wide It is on the other side, Lasse, Little Lasse. ",10222,10535
146,"You have found it cold and hot, Little Lasse, Lasse; ",10535,10588
147," But in no land is God not, Lasse, Little Lasse. ",10587,10636
148,"Many men live there as here, But they all to God are dear, Little Lasse, Lasse. ",10636,10716
149,"When His angel is your guide, Little Lasse, Lasse, Then no harm can e'er betide, Even on the other side Where the wild beasts wander. ",10716,10850
150,"But tell us now, Whene'er you roam, Do you not find the best is home Of all the lands you've looked upon, Lasse, Little Lasse? ",10850,10977
151,"When the dreams had sung their song they skipped away, and Nukku Matti carried Lasse back to the boat. ",10977,11080
152,"He lay there for a long time quite still, and he still heard the frying-pan frizzling at home of the fire, the frizzling was very plain, Little Lasse heard it quite near him; ",11080,11255
153, and so he woke up and rubbed his eyes. ,11254,11294
154,"There he lay in the boat, where he had fallen asleep. ",11294,11348
155,"The wind had turned, and the boat had drifted out with one wind and drifted in with another while Little Lasse slept, and what Lasse thought was frizzling in a frying-pan was the low murmur of the waves as they washed against the stones on the shore. ",11348,11599
156,"But he was not altogether wrong, for the clear blue sea is like a great pan in which God's sun all day makes cakes for good children. ",11599,11733
157,Little Lasse rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and looked around him. ,11733,11802
158,Everything was the same as before; ,11802,11837
159," the crow in the birch tree, the cat on the grass, and the pea-shell fleet on the shore. ",11836,11925
160,"Some of the ships had foundered, and some had drifted back to land. ",11925,11993
161,"Hercules had come back with its cargo from Asia, The Flea had arrived from Polynesia, and the other parts of the world were just where they were before. ",11993,12146
162,Little Lasse did not know what to think. ,12146,12187
163,He had so often been in that grotto in the 'Land of Nod' and did not know what tricks dreams can play. ,12187,12290
164,But Little Lasse did not trouble his head with such things; ,12290,12350
165, he gathered together his boats and walked up the shore back to the house. ,12349,12424
166,"His brother and sister ran to meet him, and called out from the distance, 'Where have you been so long, Lasse? ",12424,12535
167,Come home and get some bread-and-butter.' ,12535,12577
168,"The kitchen door stood open, and inside was heard a strange frizzling. ",12577,12648
169,"The gardener was near the gate, watering the dill and parsley, the carrots and parsnips. ",12648,12737
170,"'Well,' he said, 'where has Little Lasse been so long?' ",12737,12793
171,"Little Lasse straightened himself up stiff, and answered: 'I have sailed round the world in a pea-shell boat.' ",12793,12904
172,'Oh!' ,12904,12910
173,said the gardener. ,808,827
174,He has forgotten Dreamland. ,12929,12957
175,But you have not forgotten it; ,12957,12988
176, you know that it exists. ,12987,13013
177,"You know the beautiful grotto and the bright silver walls whose lustre never fades, the sparkling diamonds which never grow dim, the music which never ceases its low, soft murmur through the sweet evening twilight. ",13013,13228
178,The airy fairy fancies of happy Dreamland never grow old; ,13228,13286
179," they, like the glorious stars above us, are always young. ",13285,13344
180,Perhaps you have caught a glimpse of their ethereal wings as they flew around your pillow. ,13344,13435
181,"Perhaps you have met the same dream-boy with the blue eyes and the fair hair, the one who wore the red cap with the silver band and the white coat with pearls on the collar. ",13435,13609
182,"Perhaps he has taken you to see all the countries of the world and the peoples, the cold waste lands and the burning deserts, the many coloured men and the wild creatures in the sea and in the woods, so that you may earn many things, but come gladly home again. ",13609,13871
183,"Yes, who knows? ",13871,13887
184,Perhaps you also have sailed round the wide world once in a pea-shell boat.,13887,13963
