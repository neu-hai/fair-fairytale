0,"Once upon a time when wishes came true there was a king's son who was enchanted by an old witch, so that he was obliged to sit in a large iron stove in a wood. ",0,160
1,"There he lived for many years, and no one could free him. ",160,218
2,At last a king's daughter came into the wood; ,218,264
3," she had lost her way, and could not find her father's kingdom again. ",263,333
4,"She had been wandering round and round for nine days, and she came at last to the iron case. ",333,426
5,"A voice came from within and asked her, 'Where do you come from, and where do you want to go?' ",426,521
6,"She answered, 'I have lost my way to my father's kingdom, and I shall never get home again.' ",521,614
7,"Then the voice from the iron stove said, 'I will help you to find your home again, and that in a very short time, if you will promise to do what I ask you. ",614,770
8,"I am a greater prince than you are a princess, and I will marry you.' ",770,840
9,"Then she grew frightened, and thought, 'What can a young lassie do with an iron stove?' ",840,928
10,"But as she wanted very much to go home to her father, she promised to do what he wished. ",928,1017
11,"He said, 'You must come again, and bring a knife with you to scrape a hole in the iron.' ",1017,1106
12,"Then he gave her someone for a guide, who walked near her and said nothing, but he brought her in two hours to her house. ",1106,1228
13,"There was great joy in the castle when the Princess came back, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her. ",1228,1341
14,"But she was very much troubled, and said, 'Dear father, listen to what has befallen me! ",1341,1429
15,"I should never have come home again out of the great wild wood if I had not come to an iron stove, to whom I have had to promise that I will go back to free him and marry him!' ",1429,1606
16,"The old King was so frightened that he nearly fainted, for she was his only daughter. ",1606,1692
17,"So they consulted together, and determined that the miller's daughter, who was very beautiful, should take her place. ",1692,1810
18,"They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she must scrape at the iron stove. ",1810,1893
19,"She scraped for twenty-four hours, but did not make the least impression. ",1893,1967
20,"When the day broke, a voice called from the iron stove, 'It seems to me that it is day outside.' ",1967,2064
21,"Then she answered, 'It seems so to me; ",2064,2103
22, I think I hear my father's mill rattling.' ,2102,2146
23,'So you are a miller's daughter! ,2146,2179
24,"Then go away at once, and tell the King's daughter to come.' ",2179,2240
25,"Then she went away, and told the old King that the thing inside the iron stove would not have her, but wanted the Princess. ",2240,2364
26,"The old King was frightened, and his daughter wept. ",2364,2416
27,"But they had a swineherd's daughter who was even more beautiful than the miller's daughter, and they gave her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the Princess. ",2416,2591
28,"Then she was taken out, and had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours, but she could make no impression. ",2591,2694
29,"As soon as the day broke the voice from the stove called out, 'It seems to be daylight outside.' ",2694,2791
30,"Then she answered, 'It seems so to me too; ",2791,2834
31, I think I hear my father blowing his horn.' ,2833,2878
32,'So you are a swineherd's daughter! ,2878,2914
33,"Go away at once, and let the King's daughter come. ",2914,2965
34,"And say to her that what I foretell shall come to pass, and if she does not come everything in the kingdom shall fall into ruin, and not one stone shall be left upon another.' ",2965,3141
35,"When the Princess heard this she began to cry, but it was no good; ",3141,3208
36, she had to keep her word. ,3207,3234
37,"She took leave of her father, put a knife in her belt, and went to the iron stove in the wood. ",3234,3329
38,"As soon as she reached it she began to scrape, and the iron gave way and before two hours had passed she had made a little hole. ",3329,3458
39,Then she peeped in and saw such a beautiful youth all shining with gold and precious stones that she fell in love with him on the spot. ,3458,3594
40,"So she scraped away harder than ever, and made the hole so large that he could get out. ",3594,3682
41,"Then he said, 'You are mine, and I am thine; ",3682,3727
42, you are my bride and have set me free!' ,3726,3767
43,"He wanted to take her with him to his kingdom, but she begged him just to let her go once more to her father; ",3767,3877
44," and the Prince let her go, but told her not to say more than three words to her father, then to come back again. ",3876,3990
45,"So she went home, but alas! ",3990,4018
46,she said MORE THAN THREE WORDS; ,4018,4050
47, and immediately the iron stove vanished and went away over a mountain of glass and sharp swords. ,4049,4147
48,"But the Prince was free, and was no longer shut up in it. ",4147,4205
49,"Then she said good-bye to her father, and took a little money with her, and went again into the great wood to look for the iron stove; ",4205,4340
50, but she could not find it. ,4339,4367
51,"She sought it for nine days, and then her hunger became so great that she did not know how she could live any longer. ",4367,4485
52,"And when it was evening she climbed a little tree and wished that the night would not come, because she was afraid of the wild beasts. ",4485,4620
53,"When midnight came she saw afar off a little light, and thought, 'Ah! ",4620,4690
54,if only I could reach that!' ,4690,4719
55,Then she got down from the tree and went towards the light. ,4719,4779
56,"She came to a little old house with a great deal of grass growing round, and stood in front of a little heap of wood. ",4779,4897
57,"She thought, 'Alas! ",4897,4917
58,what am I coming to?' ,4917,4939
59,and peeped through the window; ,4939,4970
60," but she saw nothing inside except big and little toads, and a table beautifully spread with roast meats and wine, and all the dishes and drinking-cups were of silver. ",4969,5137
61,Then she took heart and knocked. ,5137,5170
62,"Then a fat toad called out: 'Little green toad with leg like crook, Open wide the door, and look Who it was the latch that shook.' ",5170,5301
63,And a little toad came forward and let her in. ,5301,5348
64,"When she entered they all bid her welcome, and made her sit down. ",5348,5414
65,They asked her how she came there and what she wanted. ,5414,5469
66,"Then she told everything that had happened to her, and how, because she had exceeded her permission only to speak three words, the stove had disappeared with the Prince; ",5469,5639
67," and how she had searched a very long time, and must wander over mountain and valley till she found him. ",5638,5743
68,"Then the old toad said: 'Little green toad whose leg doth twist, Go to the corner of which you wist, And bring to me the large old kist.' ",5743,5881
69,And the little toad went and brought out a great chest. ,5881,5937
70,"Then they gave her food and drink, and led her to a beautifully made bed of silk and samite, on which she lay down and slept soundly. ",5937,6071
71,"When the day dawned she arose, and the old toad gave her three things out of the huge chest to take with her. ",6071,6181
72,"She would have need of them, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, three cutting swords, and a great lake. ",6181,6294
73,When she had passed these she would find her lover again. ,6294,6352
74,"So she was given three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts, which she was to take great care of. ",6352,6459
75,"She set out with these things, and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery she stuck the three needles behind her feet and then in front, and so got over it, and when she was on the other side put them carefully away. ",6459,6695
76,"Then she reached the three cutting swords, and got on her plough-wheel and rolled over them. ",6695,6788
77,"At last she came to a great lake, and, when she had crossed that, arrived at a beautiful castle. ",6788,6885
78,"She went in and gave herself out as a servant, a poor maid who would gladly be engaged. ",6885,6973
79,But she knew that the Prince whom she had freed from the iron stove in the great wood was in the castle. ,6973,7078
80,So she was taken on as a kitchen-maid for very small wages. ,7078,7138
81,"Now the Prince was about to marry another princess, for he thought she was dead long ago. ",7138,7228
82,"In the evening, when she had washed up and was ready, she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her. ",7228,7364
83,"She cracked one and was going to eat the kernel, when behold! ",7364,7426
84,there was a beautiful royal dress inside it! ,7426,7471
85,"When the bride heard of this, she came and begged for the dress, and wanted to buy it, saying that it was not a dress for a serving-maid. ",7471,7609
86,"Then she said she would not sell it unless she was granted one favour-namely, to sleep by the Prince's door. ",7609,7718
87,"The bride granted her this, because the dress was so beautiful and she had so few like it. ",7718,7809
88,"When it was evening she said to her bridegroom, 'That stupid maid wants to sleep by your door.' ",7809,7905
89,"'If you are contented, I am,' he said. ",7905,7944
90,But she gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught. ,7944,8021
91,"Then they both went to his room, but he slept so soundly that she could not wake him. ",8021,8107
92,"The maid wept all night long, and said, 'I freed you in the wild wood out of the iron stove; ",8107,8200
93," I have sought you, and have crossed a glassy mountain, three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found you, and will you not hear me now?' ",8199,8343
94,"The servants outside heard how she cried the whole night, and they told their master in the morning. ",8343,8444
95,"When she had washed up the next evening she bit the second nut, and there was a still more beautiful dress inside. ",8444,8559
96,When the bride saw it she wanted to buy it also. ,8559,8608
97,"But the maid did not want money, and asked that she should sleep again by the Prince's door. ",8608,8701
98,"The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-draught, and he slept so soundly that he heard nothing. ",8701,8797
99,"But the kitchen-maid wept the whole night long, and said, 'I have freed you in a wood and from an iron stove; ",8797,8907
100," I sought you and have crossed a glassy mountain, three sharp swords, and a great lake to find you, and now you will not hear me!' ",8906,9037
101,"The servants outside heard how she cried the whole night, and in the morning they told their master. ",9037,9138
102,"And when she had washed up on the third night she bit the third nut, and there was a still more beautiful dress inside that was made of pure gold. ",9138,9285
103,"When the bride saw it she wanted to have it, but the maid would only give it her on condition that she should sleep for the third time by the Prince's door. ",9285,9442
104,But the Prince took care not to drink the sleeping-draught. ,9442,9502
105,"When she began to weep and to say, 'Dearest sweetheart, I freed you in the horrible wild wood, and from an iron stove,' he jumped up and said, 'You are right. ",9502,9661
106,"You are mine, and I am thine.' ",9661,9692
107,"Though it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took the false bride's clothes away, so that she could not follow them. ",9692,9833
108,"When they came to the great lake they rowed across, and when they reached the three sharp swords they sat on the plough-wheel, and on the glassy mountain they stuck the three needles in. ",9833,10020
109,"So they arrived at last at the little old house, but when they stepped inside it turned into a large castle. ",10020,10129
110,"The toads were all freed, and were beautiful King's children, running about for joy. ",10129,10214
111,"There they were married, and they remained in the castle, which was much larger than that of the Princess's father's. ",10214,10332
112,"But because the old man did not like being left alone, they went and fetched him. ",10332,10414
113,So they had two kingdoms and lived in great wealth. ,10414,10466
114,"A mouse has run, My story's done.",10466,10500
