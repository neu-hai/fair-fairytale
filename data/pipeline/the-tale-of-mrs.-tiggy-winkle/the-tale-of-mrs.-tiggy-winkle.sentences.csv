0,"ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. ",0,95
1,She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs! ,95,176
2,"One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so! ",176,249
3,"""I've lost my pocket-handkin! ",249,279
4,Three handkins and a pinny! ,279,307
5,"Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?"" ",307,342
6,THE Kitten went on washing her white paws; ,342,385
7," so Lucie asked a speckled hen-- ""Sally Henny-penny, has YOU found three pocket-handkins?"" ",384,475
8,"But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking-- ""I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!"" ",475,561
9,AND then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig. ,561,612
10,"Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away. ",612,710
11,Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top! ,710,851
12,And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass. ,851,944
13,LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; ,944,1015
14, she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney! ,1014,1153
15,"PRESENTLY she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side. ",1153,1218
16,"Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! ",1218,1363
17,And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a VERY small person. ,1363,1451
18,"Lucie ran on, and on. ",1451,1473
19,THE path ended under a big rock. ,1473,1506
20,"The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs! ",1506,1682
21,But there was something else--a door! ,1682,1720
22,straight into the hill; ,1720,1744
23," and inside it some one was singing-- ""Lily-white and clean, oh! ",1743,1808
24,"With little frills between, oh! ",1808,1840
25,"Smooth and hot--red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!"" ",1840,1896
26,"LUCIE, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. ",1896,1951
27,"A little frightened voice called out ""Who's that?"" ",1951,2002
28,Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. ,2002,2169
29,Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; ,2169,2234
30," and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there. ",2233,2297
31,THERE was a nice hot singey smell; ,2297,2332
32," and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie. ",2331,2435
33,"Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. ",2435,2527
34,"Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; ",2527,2617
35, and underneath her cap--where Lucie had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES! ,2616,2704
36,"""WHO are you?"" ",2704,2719
37,said Lucie. ,2719,2731
38,"""Have you seen my pocket-handkins?"" ",2731,2767
39,"The little person made a bob-curtsey--""Oh, yes, if you please'm; ",2767,2832
40, my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; ,2831,2862
41," oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!"" ",2861,2921
42,"And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket. ",2921,3007
43,"""WHAT'S that thing?"" ",3007,3028
44,"said Lucie--""that's not my pocket-handkin?"" ",3028,3072
45,"""Oh no, if you please'm; ",3072,3097
46," that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!"" ",3096,3158
47,"And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side. ",3158,3215
48,"THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse--""That isn't my pinny?"" ",3215,3288
49,said Lucie. ,2719,2731
50,"""Oh no, if you please'm; ",3072,3097
51, that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; ,3324,3378
52, look how it's stained with currant wine! ,3377,3419
53,"It's very bad to wash!"" ",3419,3443
54,said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ,3443,3467
55,"MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE'S nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; ",3467,3560
56, and she fetched another hot iron from the fire. ,3559,3608
57,"""THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins!"" ",3608,3645
58,"cried Lucie--""and there's my pinny!"" ",3645,3682
59,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills. ",3682,3754
60,"""Oh that IS lovely!"" ",3754,3775
61,said Lucie. ,2719,2731
62,"""AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?"" ",3787,3853
63,"""Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! ",3853,3980
64,"She'll very soon go barefoot!"" ",3980,4011
65,said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ,3443,3467
66,"""WHY, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; ",4035,4090
67," it's red?"" ",4089,4101
68,"""Oh no, if you please'm; ",3072,3097
69, that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; ,4125,4163
70, and it DID so smell of onions! ,4162,4194
71,"I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell."" ",4194,4254
72,"""There's another one of mine,"" said Lucie. ",4254,4297
73,"""WHAT are those funny little white things?"" ",4297,4341
74,"""That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; ",4341,4394
75, I only have to iron them; ,4393,4420
76," she washes them herself."" ",4419,4446
77,"""There's my last pocket-handkin!"" ",4446,4480
78,said Lucie. ,2719,2731
79,"""AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?"" ",4492,4545
80,"""They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most terrible particular!"" ",4545,4634
81,said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ,3443,3467
82,"""Now I've finished my ironing; ",4658,4689
83," I'm going to air some clothes."" ",4688,4721
84,"""WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things?"" ",4721,4763
85,said Lucie. ,2719,2731
86,"""Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl."" ",4775,4845
87,"""Will their jackets take off?"" ",4845,4876
88,asked Lucy. ,4876,4888
89,"""Oh yes, if you please'm; ",4888,4914
90, look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. ,4913,4954
91,"And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. ",4954,5030
92,"They're ALWAYS marked at washing!"" ",5030,5065
93,said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ,3443,3467
94,AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; ,5089,5164
95, and one velvety black mole-skin waist-coat; ,5163,5208
96, and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; ,5207,5271
97, and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; ,5270,5333
98," and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty! ",5332,5431
99,THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. ,5431,5503
100,They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. ,5503,5575
101,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; ",5575,5685
102," and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out; ",5684,5768
103, so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; ,5767,5889
104, and one velvety black mole-skin waist-coat; ,5163,5208
105, and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; ,5207,5271

109,They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. ,5503,5575
110,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; ",5575,5685

112, so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.A,5767,5815
113,"WHEN they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; ",6540,6605
114," and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin. ",6604,6716
115,"And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill. ",6716,6829
116,THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes! ,6829,6918
117,All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; ,6918,6994
118, the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny! ,6993,7061
119,AND she gave them their nice clean clothes; ,7061,7105
120, and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ,7104,7195
121,"SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle. ",7195,7324
122,LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; ,7324,7382
123," and then she turned to say ""Good-night,"" and to thank the washer-woman--But what a VERY odd thing! ",7381,7481
124,Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill! ,7481,7557
125,She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? ,7557,7639
126,and her shawl? ,7639,7654
127,and her gown--and her petticoat? ,7654,7687
128,AND how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with PRICKLES! ,7687,7758
129,Why! ,7758,7763
130,Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG. ,7763,7809
131,"(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin? ",7809,7988
132,And besides--_I_ have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. ,7988,8124
