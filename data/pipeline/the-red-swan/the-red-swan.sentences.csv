0,"Three brothers were left destitute, by the death of their parents, at an early age. ",0,84
1,"The eldest was not yet able to provide fully for their support, but he did all that he could in hunting. ",84,189
2,"With this aid, and the stock of provisions already laid by in the lodge, they managed to keep along. ",189,290
3,"They had no neighbors to lend them a helping hand, for the father had withdrawn many years before from the body of the tribe, and had lived ever since in a solitary place. ",290,462
4,The lads had no idea that there was a human being near them. ,462,523
5,They did not even know who their parents had been. ,523,574
6,"At the time of their death, the eldest was too young to remember it. ",574,643
7,"Forlorn as they were, they however kept a good heart, and making use of every chance, in course of time they all acquired a knowledge of hunting and the pursuit of game. ",643,813
8,"The eldest became expert in the craft of the forest, and he was very successful in procuring food. ",813,912
9,"He was noted for his skill in killing buffalo, elk, and moose. ",912,975
10,"He instructed his brothers, so that each should become a master over a particular animal which was assigned to him. ",975,1091
11,"After they had become able to hunt and to take care of themselves, the elder proposed to leave them and to go in search of the world, promising to return as soon as he could procure them wives. ",1091,1285
12,"In this intention he was overruled by his brothers, who said that they could not part with him. ",1285,1381
13,"Jeekewis, the second, was loud in disapproval of the scheme, saying: ""What will you do with those you propose to get? ",1381,1499
14,"We have lived so long by ourselves, we can still do without them."" ",1499,1566
15,"This counsel prevailed, and for a time the three brothers continued together. ",1566,1644
16,"One day they agreed to kill each a male of that kind of animal, which each was most expert in hunting, for the purpose of making quivers from their skins. ",1644,1799
17,"When these quivers were prepared, they were straightway filled, with arrows. ",1799,1876
18,They all had a presentiment that something was about to happen which called upon them to be ready. ,1876,1975
19,"Soon after they hunted on a wager to see who should come in first with game, and have the privilege of acting as entertainer to the others. ",1975,2115
20,They were to shoot no other beast or bird than such as each was in the habit of killing. ,2115,2204
21,They set out on different paths. ,2204,2237
22,"Maidwa, the youngest, had not gone far before he saw a bear, an animal he was not to kill, by the agreement. ",2237,2346
23,"He, however, followed him closely, and driving an arrow through and through him, he brought him to the ground. ",2346,2457
24,"Although contrary to the engagement with his brothers, Maidwa commenced skinning him, when suddenly something red tinged the air all around him. ",2457,2602
25,"He rubbed his eyes, thinking he was perhaps deceived. ",2602,2656
26,"But rub as hard as he would, the red hue still crimsoned the air, and tinged every object that he looked on--the tree-tops, the river that flowed, and the deer that glided away along the edge of the forest--with its delicate splendor. ",2656,2891
27,"As he stood musing on this fairy spectacle, a strange noise came to his ear from a distance. ",2891,2984
28,At first it seemed like a human voice. ,2984,3023
29,After following the sound he reached the shore of a lake. ,3023,3081
30,"Floating at a distance upon its waters sat a most beautiful Red Swan, whose plumage glittered in the sun, and when it lifted up its neck, it uttered the peculiar tone he had heard. ",3081,3262
31,"He was within long bow-shot, and, drawing the arrow to his ear, he took a careful aim and discharged the shaft. ",3262,3374
32,It took no effect. ,3374,3393
33,"The beautiful bird sat proudly on the water, still pouring forth its peculiar chant, and still spreading the radiance of its plumage far and wide, and lighting up the whole world, beneath the eye of Maidwa, with its ruby splendors. ",3393,3625
34,"He shot again and again, till his quiver was empty, for he longed to possess so glorious a creature. ",3625,3726
35,"Still the swan did not spread its wings to fly, but, circling round and round, stretched its long neck and dipped its bill into the water, as if indifferent to mortal shafts. ",3726,3901
36,"Maidwa ran home, and bringing all the arrows in the lodge, shot them away. ",3901,3976
37,"He then stood with his bow dropped at his side, lost in wonder, gazing at the beautiful bird. ",3976,4070
38,"While standing thus, with a heart beating more and more eagerly every moment for the possession of this fair swan, Maidwa remembered the saying of his elder brother, that in their deceased father's medicine-sack were three magic arrows. ",4070,4307
39,"His brother had not told Maidwa that their father, on his death-bed, which he alone had attended, had especially bequeathed the arrows to his youngest son, Maidwa, from whom they had been wrongfully kept. ",4307,4512
40,"The thought of the magic arrows put heart in Maidwa, and he hastened with all speed to secure them. ",4512,4612
41,"At any other time he would have shrunk from opening his father's medicine-sack, but something prompted him to believe that there was no wrong now. ",4612,4759
42,"Snatching them forth he ran back, not staying to restore the other contents to the sack, but leaving them scattered, here and there, about the lodge. ",4759,4909
43,"He feared, as he returned, that the swan must by this time have taken wing. ",4909,4985
44,"But, as he emerged from the wood, to his great delight the air was as rosy as ever, and there, in her own serene and beautiful way, still sat the glorious Red Swan. ",4985,5150
45,With trembling hand he shot the first of his magic shafts: it grazed a wing. ,5150,5227
46,"The second came closer, and cut away a few of the bright red feathers, which fluttered and fell like flakes of fire in the water. ",5227,5357
47,"The third, which he carefully aimed and drew home upon the string with all his force, made the lucky hit, and passed through the neck of the bird a little above the breast. ",5357,5530
48,"""The bird is mine,"" said Maidwa, to himself. ",5530,5575
49,"But to his great surprise, instead of seeing it droop its neck and drift to the shore, the Red Swan flapped its wings, rose slowly, and flew off with a majestic motion toward the falling sun. ",5575,5767
50,"Maidwa, that he might meet his brothers, rescued two of the magic arrows from the water; ",5767,5856
51," and although the third was borne off, he had a hope yet to recover that too, and to be master of the swan. ",5855,5963
52,He was noted for his speed; ,5963,5991
53, for he would shoot an arrow and then run so fast that the arrow always fell behind him; ,5990,6079
54, and he now set off at his best speed of foot. ,6078,6125
55,"""I can run fast,"" he thought, ""and I can get up with the swan some time or other."" ",6125,6208
56,"He sped on, over hills and prairies, toward the west, and was only going to take one more run, and then seek a place to sleep for the night, when, suddenly, he heard noises at a distance, like the murmur of waters against the shore. ",6208,6441
57,"As he went on, he heard voices, and presently he saw people, some of whom were busy felling trees, and the strokes of their labor echoed through the woods. ",6441,6597
58,"He passed on, and when he emerged from the forest, the sun was just falling below the edge of the sky. ",6597,6700
59,"He was bent on success in pursuit of the swan, whose red track he marked well far westward till she was lost to sight. ",6700,6819
60,"Meanwhile he would tarry for the night and procure something to eat, as he had fasted since he had left home. ",6819,6929
61,"At a distance, on a rising ground, he could see the lodges of a large village. ",6929,7008
62,"He went toward it, and soon heard the watchman, who was set on a height to overlook the place, and give notice of the approach of friends or foes, crying out, ""We are visited;""",7008,7184
63,""" and a loud halloo indicated that they had all heard it. ",7183,7241
64,"When Maidwa advanced, the watchman pointed to the lodge of the chief. ",7241,7311
65,"""It is there you must go in,"" he said, and left him. ",7311,7364
66,"""Come in, come in,"" said the chief; ",7364,7400
67," ""take a seat there;""",7399,7420
68,""" pointing to the side of the lodge where his daughter sat. ",7419,7479
69,"""It is there you must sit."" ",7479,7507
70,"They gave him something to eat, and, being a stranger, very few questions were put to him. ",7507,7598
71,It was only when he spoke that the others answered him. ,7598,7654
72,"""Daughter,"" said the chief, as soon as the night had set in, ""take our son-in-law's moccasins and see if they be torn. ",7654,7773
73,"If so, mend them for him, and bring in his bundle."" ",7773,7825
74,"Maidwa thought it strange that he should be so warmly received, and married instantly against his own wishes, although he could not help noticing that the chief's daughter was pretty. ",7825,8009
75,It was some time before she would take the moccasins which he had laid off. ,8009,8085
76,It displeased him to see her reluctant to do so. ,8085,8134
77,"When at last she did reach them, he snatched them from her hand and hung them up himself. ",8134,8224
78,"He lay down and thought of the swan, and made up his mind to be off with the dawn. ",8224,8307
79,"He wakened early, and finding the chief's daughter looking forth at the door, he spoke to her, but she gave no answer. ",8307,8426
80,He touched her lightly. ,8426,8450
81,"""What do you want?"" ",8450,8470
82,"she said, and turned her face away from him. ",8470,8515
83,"""Tell me,"" said Maidwa, ""what time the swan passed. ",8515,8567
84,I am following it; ,8567,8586
85," come out, and point the way."" ",8585,8616
86,"""Do you think you can overtake it?"" ",8616,8652
87,she said. ,8652,8662
88,"""Yes,"" he answered. ",8662,8682
89,"""Naubesah--fool!"" ",8682,8700
90,retorted the chief's pretty daughter. ,8700,8738
91,"She, however, went out, and pointed in the direction he should go. ",8738,8805
92,"The young man paced slowly along till the sun arose, when he commenced traveling at his accustomed speed. ",8805,8911
93,"He passed the day in running, and although he could not see anywhere on the horizon the Red Swan, he thought that he discerned a faint red light far over in the west. ",8911,9078
94,"When night came, he was pleased to find himself near another village. ",9078,9148
95,"When at a distance he heard the watchman crying out, ""We are visited!"" ",9148,9219
96,and soon the men of the village stood out to see the stranger. ,9219,9282
97,"He was again told to enter the lodge of the chief, and his reception was in every respect the same as on the previous night. ",9282,9407
98,"Except that the young woman was more beautiful, and that she entertained him very kindly. ",9407,9497
99,"Although urged to stay with them, the mind of Maidwa was fixed on the object of his journey. ",9497,9590
100,"Before daybreak he asked the young woman at what time the Red Swan passed, and to point out the way. ",9590,9691
101,"She marked against the sky with her finger the course it had taken, and told him that it had passed yesterday when the sun was between mid-day and its falling-place. ",9691,9857
102,"Maidwa again set out rather slowly, but when the sun had risen, he tried his speed by shooting an arrow ahead, and running after it. ",9857,9990
103,"But it fell behind him, and he knew that he had lost nothing of his quickness of foot. ",9990,10077
104,"Nothing remarkable happened through the day, and he went on leisurely. ",10077,10148
105,"Some time after dark, as he was peering around the country for a shelter, he saw a light emitted from a small low lodge. ",10148,10269
106,"He went up to it very slyly, and, peeping through the door, he discovered an old man alone, with his head down upon his breast, warming his back before the fire. ",10269,10431
107,Maidwa thought that the old man did not know that he was standing near the door. ,10431,10512
108,In this he was mistaken. ,10512,10537
109,"Without turning his eyes to look at him, the old man said, ""Walk in, my grandchild. ",10537,10621
110,"Take a seat opposite to me, and take off your things and dry them, for you must be fatigued. ",10621,10714
111,"I will prepare you something to eat, and you shall have something very delicate."" ",10714,10796
112,"Maidwa accepted this kind invitation, and entered the lodge. ",10796,10857
113,"The old man then remarked, as if in mere course of conversation: ""My kettle with water stands near the fire."" ",10857,10967
114,Immediately a small earthen pot with legs appeared by the fire. ,10967,11031
115,"He then took one grain of corn, also one of whortleberry, and put them in the pot. ",11031,11114
116,"Maidwa was very hungry, and seeing the limited scale of the old man's housekeeping, he thought his chance for a supper was very slight. ",11114,11250
117,"The old man had promised him something very delicate, and he seemed likely to keep his word. ",11250,11343
118,"Maidwa looked on silently, and did not change his face any more than if the greatest banquet that was ever spread had been going forward. ",11343,11481
119,"The pot soon boiled, when the old man said in a very quiet way: ""The pot will stand at a distance from the fire."" ",11481,11595
120,"It removed itself, and the old man added to Maidwa: ""My grandchild, feed yourself;""",11595,11678
121,""" handing him at the same time a dish and ladle of the same ware as the pot itself. ",11677,11761
122,"The young man, whose hunger was very great, helped himself to all that was in the pot. ",11761,11848
123,"He felt ashamed to think that he had done so, but before he could speak the old man said: ""Eat, nay grandchild. ",11848,11960
124,"Eat, eat!"" ",11960,11971
125,"and soon after he again said--""Help yourself from the pot."" ",11971,12031
126,"Maidwa was surprised, on dipping in his ladle, to see that it was full. ",12031,12103
127,"Although he emptied it a second time, it was still again filled and refilled till his hunger was entirely satisfied. ",12103,12220
128,"The old man then observed, without raising his voice: ""The pot will return to its corner;""",12220,12310
129,""" and the pot took itself off to its accustomed place in an out-of-the-way corner of the lodge. ",12309,12405
130,"Maidwa observed that the old man was about to address him, and took an attitude which showed that he was prepared to listen. ",12405,12530
131,"""Keep on, my grandchild,"" said the old man. ",12530,12574
132,"""You will surely gain that you seek. ",12574,12611
133,"To tell you more I am not permitted, but go on as you have begun and you will not be disappointed. ",12611,12710
134,"To-morrow you will again reach one of my fellow old men, but the one you will see after him will tell you all, and the manner in which you must proceed to accomplish your journey. ",12710,12890
135,"Often has this Red Swan passed, and those who have followed it have never returned. ",12890,12974
136,"You must be firm in your resolution, and be prepared for all that may happen."" ",12974,13053
137,"""So will it be,"" answered Maidwa; ",13053,13087
138, and they both laid down to sleep. ,13086,13121
139,"Early in the morning the old man ordered his magic kettle to prepare breakfast, so that his guest might eat before leaving. ",13121,13245
140,"As Maidwa passed out, the old man gave him a blessing with his parting advice. ",13245,13324
141,Maidwa set forth in better spirits than at any time since he had started. ,13324,13398
142,"Night again found him in company with an old man who entertained him kindly, with a frisky little kettle which hurried up to the fire before it was spoken to, bustled about and set his supper briskly before Maidwa, and frisked away again, without waiting for orders. ",13398,13665
143,The old man also carefully directed him on his way in the morning. ,13665,13732
144,"He traveled with a light heart, as he now expected to meet the one who was to give him directions how to proceed to get the Red Swan. ",13732,13866
145,Toward night-fall Maidwa reached the lodge of the third old man. ,13866,13931
146,"Before coming to the door he heard him saying: ""Grandchild, come in;""",13931,14000
147,""" and going in promptly he felt quite at home. ",13999,14046
148,"The old man prepared him something to eat, acting as the other magicians had done, and his kettle was of the same size, and looked as if it were an own brother of the two others which had feasted him. ",14046,14247
149,"Except that this kettle, in coming and going about its household duties, would make a passing remark, or sing a little tune for itself. ",14247,14383
150,"The old man waited until Maidwa had fully satisfied his hunger, when he addressed him: Young man, the errand you are bound on is beset with trials and difficulties. ",14383,14548
151,"Numbers have passed with the same purpose as that which now prompts you, but they never returned. ",14548,14646
152,"Be careful, and if your guardian spirits are powerful you may succeed. ",14646,14717
153,"This Red Swan you are following is the daughter of a magician who has abundance of every thing, but only this one child, whom he values more than the sacred arrows. ",14717,14882
154,"In former times he wore a cap of wampum, which was attached to his scalp. ",14882,14956
155,"But powerful Indians, warriors of a distant chief, came and told him that their chief's daughter was on the brink of the grave, and that she herself requested his wampum-cap, which she was confident would save her life. ",14956,15176
156,"'If I can only see it,' she said, 'I will recover.' ",15176,15228
157,"It was for this cap they had come, and after long solicitation the magician at length consented to part with it, in the hope that it would restore to health the dying maiden, although when he took it off to hand it to the messengers it left the crown of his head bare and bloody. ",15228,15508
158,"Years have passed since, and it has not healed. ",15508,15556
159,"The coming of the warriors to procure it for the sick maiden was a cheat, and they are now constantly making sport of the unhappy scalp--dancing it about from village to village--and on every insult it receives the poor old chief to whom it belongs groans with pain. ",15556,15823
160,"Those who hold it are too powerful for the magician, and many have sacrificed themselves to recover it for him, but without success. ",15823,15956
161,"The Red Swan has enticed many a young man, as she has you, to enlist them to procure the scalp, and whoever is so fortunate as to succeed, it is understood, will receive the Red Swan as his reward. ",15956,16154
162,"In the morning you will proceed on your way, and toward evening you will come to this magician's lodge. ",16154,16258
163,You will know it by the groans which you will hear far over the prairie as you approach. ,16258,16347
164,He will ask you in. ,16347,16367
165,You will see no one but himself. ,16367,16400
166,He will question you much as to your dreams and the strength of your guardian spirits. ,16400,16487
167,"If he is satisfied with your answers, he will urge you to attempt the recovery of his scalp. ",16487,16580
168,"He will show you the course to take, and if you feel inclined, as I see that you do, go forward, my son, with a strong heart; ",16580,16706
169," persevere, and I have a presentiment that you will succeed. ",16705,16766
170,"Maidwa answered, ""I will try."" ",16766,16797
171,"Betimes in the morning, after having eaten from the magic kettle, which sung a sort of farewell chant on its way from the fire-place to its station in the corner, he set off on his journey. ",16797,16987
172,"Toward evening, Maidwa, as he crossed a prairie, heard, as had been predicted, groans from a distant lodge, which were only interrupted by a voice from a person whom he could not see, calling to him aloud: ""Come in! ",16987,17203
173,"come in!"" ",17203,17213
174,"On entering the lodge, the magician heaved a great groan from the very bottom of his chest, and Maidwa saw that the crown of his head was all bare and bloody. ",17213,17372
175,"""Sit down, sit down,"" he said, ""while I prepare you something to eat. ",17372,17442
176,You see how poor I am. ,17442,17465
177,"I have to attend to all my own wants, with no other servant than that poor little kettle in the corner. ",17465,17569
178,"Kettle, we will have something to eat, if you please."" ",17569,17624
179,"""In a moment,"" the kettle spoke up from the corner. ",17624,17676
180,"""You will oblige me by making all the dispatch you can,"" said the magician, in a very humble tone, still addressing the kettle. ",17676,17804
181,"""Have patience,"" replied the kettle, ""and I will be with you presently."" ",17804,17877
182,"After a considerable delay, there came forward out of the corner from which it had spoken, a great heavy-browed and pot-bodied kettle, which advanced with much stateliness and solemnity of manner till it had come directly in front of the magician, whom it addressed with the question: ""What shall we have, sir?"" ",17877,18189
183,"""Corn, if you please,"" the magician answered. ",18189,18235
184,"""No, we will have whortleberries,"" rejoined the kettle, in a firm voice. ",18235,18308
185,"""Very well; ",18308,18320
186," just as you choose."" ",18319,18341
187,"When he supposed it was time, the magician invited Maidwa to help himself. ",18341,18416
188,"""Hold a minute,"" interposed the kettle, as Maidwa was about to dip in his ladle. ",18416,18497
189,"He paused, and after a delay, the kettle, shaking itself up and simmering very loudly, said, ""Now we are ready."" ",18497,18610
190,Maidwa fell to and satisfied his hunger. ,18610,18651
191,"""Will the kettle now withdraw?"" ",18651,18683
192,"asked the magician, with am air of much deference. ",18683,18734
193,"""No,"" said the kettle, ""we will stay and hear what the young man has to say for himself."" ",18734,18824
194,"""Very well,"" said the magician. ",18824,18856
195,"""You see,"" he added to Maidwa, ""how poor I am. ",18856,18903
196,"I have to take counsel with the kettle, or I should be all alone, without a day's food, and with no one to advise me."" ",18903,19022
197,"All this time the Red Swan was carefully concealed in the lodge, behind a curtain, from which Maidwa heard now and then a rustling noise, that fluttered his spirits and set his heart to beating at a wonderful rate. ",19022,19237
198,"As soon as Maidwa had partaken of food and laid aside his leggings and moccasins, the old magician commenced telling him how he had lost his scalp, the insults it was receiving, the pain he suffered thereby, his wishes to regain it, the many unsuccessful attempts that had already been made, and the numbers and power of those who retained it. ",19237,19581
199,"He would interrupt his discourse, at times, with sudden groans, and say: ""Oh, how shamefully they are treating it."" ",19581,19697
200,Maidwa listened to all the old magician had to say with solemn attention. ,19697,19771
201,"The magician renewed his discourse, and inquired of Maidwa as to his dreams, or what he saw in his sleep, at such times as he had fasted and darkened his face to procure guardian spirits. ",19771,19959
202,Maidwa then told him one dream. ,19959,19991
203,The magician groaned. ,19991,20013
204,"""No, that is not it,"" he said. ",20013,20044
205,Maidwa told him of two or three others. ,20044,20084
206,"The magician groaned again and again, and said, rather peevishly, ""No, these are not the dreams."" ",20084,20182
207,"""Keep cool,"" said the kettle, which had left the fire, and was standing in the middle of the floor, where a pleasant breeze was blowing through the lodge, and added, ""Have you no more dreams of another kind?"" ",20182,20391
208,"""Yes,"" said Maidwa; ",20391,20411
209, and he told him one. ,20410,20432
210,"""That will do,"" said the kettle. ",20432,20465
211,"""We are much pleased with that."" ",20465,20498
212,"""Yes, that is it--that is it!"" ",20498,20529
213,the magician added. ,20529,20549
214,"""You will cause me to live. ",20549,20577
215,That was what I was wishing you to say. ,20577,20617
216,"Will you then go and see if you can not recover my poor scalp?"" ",20617,20681
217,"""Yes,"" said Maidwa, ""I will go; ",20681,20713
218," and the day after to-morrow, when you hear the ka-kak cries of the hawk, you will know that I am successful. ",20712,20822
219,"You must prepare your head, and lean it out through the door, so that the moment I arrive I may place your scalp on."" ",20822,20940
220,"""Yes, yes,"" said the magician. ",20940,20971
221,"""As you say it will be done."" ",20971,21001
222,Early the next morning Maidwa set out to fulfill his promise; ,21001,21063
223," and in the afternoon, when the sun hangs toward home, he heard the shouts of a great many people. ",21062,21161
224,"He was in a wood at the time, and saw, as he thought, only a few men, but as he went on they increased in numbers. ",21161,21276
225,"On emerging upon the plain, their heads appeared like the hanging leaves, they were so many. ",21276,21369
226,"In the middle of the plain he perceived a post, and something waving at its top. ",21369,21450
227,It was the wampum scalp; ,21450,21475
228," and every now and then the air was rent with the war-song, for they were dancing the war-dance in high spirit around it. ",21474,21596
229,"Before he could be observed, Maidwa changed himself into a humming-bird, and flew toward the scalp. ",21596,21696
230,"As he passed some of those who were standing by, he came close to their ears, and as they heard the rapid whirr or murmur which this bird makes when it flies, they jumped aside, and asked each other what it could be. ",21696,21913
231,"Maidwa had nearly reached the scalp, but fearing that he should be perceived while untying it, he again changed himself into the down that floats lightly on the air, and sailed slowly on to the scalp. ",21913,22114
232,"He loosened it, and moved off heavily, as the weight was almost too great for him to bear up. ",22114,22208
233,The Indians around would have snatched it away had not a lucky current of air just then buoyed him up. ,22208,22311
234,"As they saw that it was moving away they cried out, ""It is taken from us! ",22311,22385
235,"it is taken from us!"" ",22385,22407
236,Maidwa was borne gently along but a little way above their heads; ,22407,22473
237," and as they followed him, the rush and hum of the people was like the dead beating of the surges upon a lake shore after a storm. ",22472,22603
238,"But the good wind gaining strength, soon carried him beyond their pursuit. ",22603,22678
239,"A little further on he changed himself into a hawk, and flew swiftly off with his trophy, crying, ""Ka-kak! ",22678,22785
240,"ka-kak!"" ",22785,22794
241,"till it resounded with its shrill tone through the whole country, far and wide. ",22794,22874
242,"Meanwhile the magician had remembered the instructions of Maidwa, placing his head outside of the lodge as soon as he heard the ka-kak cry of the hawk. ",22874,23026
243,"In a moment Maidwa came past with rustling wings, and as he flew by, giving the magician a severe blow on the head with the wampum scalp, his limbs extended and quivered in an agony, the scalp adhered, and Maidwa, in his own person, walked into the lodge and sat down, feeling perfectly at home. ",23026,23322
244,"The magician was so long in recovering from the stunning blow which had been dealt him, that Maidwa feared that in restoring the crown of his head he had destroyed his life. ",23322,23496
245,"Presently, however, he was pleased to see him show, by the motion of his hands and limbs, that his strength was returning; ",23496,23619
246, and in a little while he rose and stood upon his feet. ,23618,23674
247,"What was the delight of Maidwa to behold, instead of a withered old man, far advanced in years and stricken in sorrow, a bright and cheerful youth, who glittered with life as he stood up before him. ",23674,23873
248,"""Thank you, my friend,"" he said. ",23873,23906
249,"""Your kindness and bravery of heart have restored me to my former shape. ",23906,23979
250,"It was so ordained, and you have now accomplished the victory."" ",23979,24043
251,They embraced; ,24043,24058
252," and the young magician urged the stay of his deliverer for a few days, and they formed a strong attachment to each other. ",24057,24180
253,"The magician, to the deep regret of Maidwa, never once alluded to the Red Swan in all their conferences. ",24180,24285
254,At last the day arrived when Maidwa prepared to return to his home. ,24285,24353
255,"The young magician bestowed on him ample presents of wampum, fur, robes, and other costly things. ",24353,24451
256,"Although Maidwa's heart was burning within him to see the Red Swan, to hear her spoken of, and to learn what his fortune was to be in regard to that fond object of his pursuit, he constrained his feelings, and so checked his countenance as to never look where he supposed she might be. ",24451,24737
257,His friend the young magician observed the same silence and caution. ,24737,24806
258,"Maidwa's pack for traveling was now ready, and he was taking his farewell smoke, when the young magician thus addressed him: ""My friend Maidwa, you know for what cause you came thus far, and why you have risked so much and waited so long. ",24806,25045
259,You have proved my friend indeed. ,25045,25079
260,"You have accomplished your object, and your noble perseverance shall not go unrewarded. ",25079,25167
261,"If you undertake other things with the same spirit, you will always succeed. ",25167,25244
262,"My destiny compels me to remain where I am, although I should feel happy to be allowed to go with you. ",25244,25347
263,"I have given you, of ordinary gifts, all you will need as long as you live; ",25347,25423
264, but I see you are backward to speak of the Red Swan. ,25422,25476
265,"I vowed that whoever procured me my lost wampum-scalp should be rewarded by possessing the Red Swan."" ",25476,25578
266,"He then spoke in a language which Maidwa did not understand, the curtain of the lodge parted, and the Red Swan met his gaze. ",25578,25703
267,"It was a beautiful female that he beheld, so majestical and airy in her look, that he seemed to see a creature whose home should rather be in the free heaven, and among the rosy clouds, than in this dusky lodge. ",25703,25915
268,"""Take her,"" the young magician said; ",25915,25952
269," ""she is my sister; ",25951,25971
270, treat her well. ,25970,25987
271,"She is worthy of you, and what you have done for me merits more. ",25987,26052
272,"She is ready to go with you to your kindred and friends, and has been so ever since your arrival; ",26052,26150
273," and my good wishes shall go with you both."" ",26149,26194
274,"The Red Swan smiled kindly on Maidwa, who advanced and greeted her. ",26194,26262
275,"Hand in hand they took their way forth from the lodge, and, watched by the young magician, advanced across the prairie on their homeward course. ",26262,26407
276,"They traveled slowly, and looked with double joy on the beautiful country over which they had both so lately passed with hearts ill at ease. ",26407,26548
277,After two or three days they reached the lodge of the third old man who had entertained him with the singing kettle; ,26548,26665
278, but the kettle was not there. ,26664,26695
279,"The old man, nevertheless, received them very kindly, and said to Maidwa, ""You see what your perseverance has secured you; ",26695,26818
280," do so always, and you will succeed in whatever you undertake."" ",26817,26881
281,"On the following morning, when they were about to start, he pulled from the side of the lodge a bag, which he presented to Maidwa, saying, ""Grandchild, I give you this; ",26881,27050
282, it contains a present for you; ,27049,27081
283," and I hope you will live happily till old age."" ",27080,27129
284,"Bidding him farewell, they again set forward; ",27129,27175
285, and they soon came to the second old man's lodge; ,27174,27225
286, he also gave them a present and bestowed his blessing. ,27224,27280
287,Nor did Maidwa see any thing here of the frisky little kettle which had been so lively on his former visit. ,27280,27388
288,"As they went on and came to the lodge of the first old man, their reception and farewell were the same; ",27388,27492
289," and when Maidwa glanced to the corner, the silent kettle, which had been the first acquaintance he had made in that family on his travels, was not there. ",27491,27646
290,"The old man smiled when he discovered the direction of Maidwa's glance, but he said nothing. ",27646,27739
291,"When, on continuing their journey, they at last approached the first town which Maidwa had passed in his pursuit, the watchman gave notice as before, and he was shown into the chief's lodge. ",27739,27930
292,"""Sit down there, son-in-law,"" said the chief, pointing to a place near his daughter. ",27930,28015
293,"""And you also,"" he said to the Red Swan. ",28015,28056
294,"The chief's daughter was engaged in coloring a girdle, and, as if indifferent to these visitors, she did not even raise her head. ",28056,28186
295,"Presently the chief said, ""Let some one bring in the bundle of our son-in-law."" ",28186,28266
296,"When the bundle was laid before him, Maidwa opened one of the bags which had been given to him. ",28266,28362
297,"It was filled with various costly articles--wampum, robes, and trinkets, of much richness and value; ",28362,28463
298," these, in token of his kindness, he presented to the chief. ",28462,28523
299,"The chief's daughter stole a glance at the costly gifts, then at Maidwa and his beautiful wife. ",28523,28619
300,"She stopped working, and was silent and thoughtful all the evening. ",28619,28687
301,"The chief himself talked with Maidwa of his adventures, congratulated him on his good fortune, and concluded by telling him that he should take his daughter along with him in the morning. ",28687,28875
302,"Maidwa said ""Yes."" ",28875,28894
303,"The chief then spoke up, saying, ""Daughter, be ready to go with him in the morning."" ",28894,28979
304,"Now it happened when the chief was thus speaking that there was a foolish fellow in the lodge, who had thought to have got this chief's daughter for a wife; ",28979,29136
305," and he jumped up, saying: ""Who is he,"" looking grimly at Maidwa, ""that he should take her for a few presents? ",29135,29246
306,"I will kill him."" ",29246,29264
307,"And he raised a knife which he had in his hand, and gave it a mighty flourish in the air. ",29264,29354
308,"He kept up this terrible flourish till some one came and pulled him back to his seat, which he had been waiting for, and then he sat quiet enough. ",29354,29501
309,"Amid the greetings of their new friends, Maidwa and the Red Swan, with the chief's daughter, took their leave by peep of day, and toward evening they reached the other town. ",29501,29675
310,"The watchman gave the signal, and numbers of men, women and children stood out to see them. ",29675,29767
311,"They were again shown into the chief's lodge, who welcomed him, saying: ""Son-in-law, you are welcome."" ",29767,29870
312,"And he requested Maidwa to take a seat by his daughter, and the two women did the same. ",29870,29958
313,"After suitable refreshment for all, and while Maidwa smoked a pipe, the chief asked him to relate his adventures in the hearing of all the inmates of the lodge, and of the strangers who had gathered in at report of his singular fortunes. ",29958,30196
314,Maidwa gave them his whole story. ,30196,30230
315,"When he came to those parts which related to the Red Swan, they turned and looked upon her in wonder and admiration, for she was very beautiful. ",30230,30375
316,"The chief then informed Maidwa that his brothers had been to their town in search of him, but that they had gone back some time before, having given up all hopes of ever seeing him again. ",30375,30563
317,"He added, that since he had shown himself a man of spirit, whom fortune was pleased to befriend, he should take his daughter with him. ",30563,30698
318,"""For although your brothers,"" he said, ""were here, they were too bashful to enter any of our lodges. ",30698,30799
319,They merely inquired for you and returned. ,30799,30842
320,"You will take my daughter, treat her well, and that will bind us more closely together."" ",30842,30931
321,"It is always the case in an assembly or gathering that some one of the number is foolish, and disposed to play the clown. ",30931,31053
322,It happened to be so here. ,31053,31080
323,"One of this very sort was in the lodge, and, after Maidwa had given the old chief presents, as he had to the other, this pretender jumped up in a passion, and cried out: ""Who is this stranger, that he should have her? ",31080,31298
324,"I want her myself."" ",31298,31318
325,"The chief bade him be quiet, and not to disturb or quarrel with one who was enjoying their hospitality. ",31318,31422
326,"""No, no,"" he exclaimed, rushing forward as in act to strike. ",31422,31483
327,"Maidwa sat unmoved, and paid no heed to his threats. ",31483,31536
328,"He cried the louder--""I will have her, I will have her!"" ",31536,31593
329,"whereupon the old chief, being now vexed past patience, took his great war-club and tapped this clownish fellow upon the head, which so far subdued him that he sat for some time quite still; ",31593,31784
330," when, after a while, he came to himself, the chief upbraided him for his folly, and told him to go out and tell stories to the old women. ",31783,31922
331,"When at last Maidwa was about to leave, he invited a number of the families of the chief to go with him and visit their hunting-grounds, where he promised them that they would find game in abundance. ",31922,32122
332,"They consented, and in the morning a large company assembled and joined Maidwa; ",32122,32202
333," and the chief, with a party of warriors, escorted them a long distance. ",32201,32274
334,"When ready to return, the chief made a speech and besought the blessing of the Good Spirit on Maidwa and his friends. ",32274,32392
335,"They parted, each on its course, making music with their war-drums, which could be heard from afar as they glittered with waving feathers in the morning sun, in their march over the prairie, which was lost in the distant sky. ",32392,32618
336,"After several days' travel, Maidwa and his friends came in sight of his home. ",32618,32696
337,The others rested within the woods while he went alone in advance to see his brothers. ,32696,32783
338,He entered the lodge. ,32783,32805
339,It was all in confusion and covered with ashes. ,32805,32853
340,"On one side, sitting among the cinders, with his face blackened, and crying aloud, was his elder brother. ",32853,32959
341,"On the other side sat the younger, Jeekewis, also with blackened face, his head covered with stray feathers and tufts of swan-down. ",32959,33091
342,This one presented so curious a figure that Maidwa could not keep from laughing. ,33091,33172
343,He seemed to be so lost and far-gone in grief that he could not notice his brother's arrival. ,33172,33266
344,"The eldest, however, after a while, lifting up his head, recognized Maidwa, jumped up and shook hands, and kissed him, and expressed much joy at his return. ",33266,33423
345,"Maidwa, as soon as he had seen the lodge set in order, made known that he had brought each of them a wife. ",33423,33530
346,"As soon as Jeekewis heard a wife spoken of, he roused from his torpor, sprang to his feet, and said: ""Why is it just now that you have come?"" ",33530,33672
347,and at once made for the door and peeped out to see the strangers. ,33672,33739
348,"He then commenced jumping and laughing, and crying out, ""Women! ",33739,33803
349,"women!"" ",33803,33811
350,and that was all the reception he gave his brother. ,33811,33863
351,"Maidwa told them to wash themselves and prepare, for he would go and fetch the females in. ",33863,33954
352,"Jeekewis scampered about, and began to wash himself; ",33954,34007
353," but he would every now and then, with one side of his head all feathers, and the other clear and shining, peep forth to look at the women again. ",34006,34152
354,"When they came near, he said, ""I will have this and that one;""",34152,34214
355,""" he did not exactly know which; ",34213,34246
356," he would sit down for an instant, and then rise, and peep about and laugh; ",34245,34321
357, in fact he acted like one beside himself. ,34320,34363
358,"As soon as order was restored, and all the company who had been brought in were seated, Maidwa presented one of the chief's daughters to his eldest brother, saying: ""These women were given to me, to dispose of in marriage. ",34363,34586
359,I now give one to each. ,34586,34610
360,"I intended so from the first."" ",34610,34641
361,"Jeekewis spoke up and said, ""I think three wives would have been enough for you."" ",34641,34723
362,"Maidwa led the other daughter to Jeekewis, and said, ""My brother, here is one for you, and live happily."" ",34723,34829
363,"Jeekewis hung down his head as if he was ashamed, but he would every now and then steal a look at his wife and also at the other women. ",34829,34965
364,By and by he turned toward his wife and acted as if he had been married for years. ,34965,35048
365,"Maidwa seeing that no preparation had been made to entertain the company, said, ""Are we to have no supper?"" ",35048,35156
366,"He had no sooner spoken, than forth from a corner stepped the silent kettle, which placed itself by the fire, and began bubbling and boiling quite briskly. ",35156,35312
367,"Presently that was joined by the big talking kettle, which said, addressing itself to Maidwa, ""Master, we shall be ready presently;""",35312,35444
368,""" and then, dancing along, came, from still another, the frisky little kettle, which hopped to their side, and took an active part in the preparations for the evening meal. ",35443,35616
369,"When all was nearly ready, a delicate voice was heard singing in the last corner of the lodge, and keeping up its dainty carol all the way to the fire-place, the fourth kettle joined the three cooks, and they all fell to with all their might, and in the best possible humor, to dispatch their work. ",35616,35915
370,"It was not long before the big kettle advanced toward Maidwa, and said, in his own confident way, ""Supper is ready!"" ",35915,36032
371,The feast was a jovial one; ,36032,36060
372," and although they were all hungry, and plied their ladles with right good will, yet, dip in as often as they would, the four magic kettles held out, and had plenty to the end of the revel. ",36059,36249
373,"To draw to a close, Maidwa and his friends lived in peace for a time; ",36249,36319
374, their town prospered; ,36318,36341
375, there was no lack of children; ,36340,36372
376, and every thing else was in abundance. ,36371,36411
377,"One day the two brothers began to look dark upon Maidwa, and to reproach him for having taken from the medicine-sack their deceased father's magic arrows; ",36411,36566
378, they upbraided him especially that one was lost. ,36565,36615
379,"After listening to them in silence, he said that he would go in search of it, and that it should be restored; ",36615,36725
380," and the very next day, true to his word, he left them. ",36724,36780
381,"After traveling a long way, and looking in every direction, almost hopeless of discovering the lost treasure, he came to an opening in the earth, and descending, it led him to the abode of departed spirits. ",36780,36987
382,"The country appeared beautiful, the pastures were greener than his own, and the sky bluer than that which hung over the lodge, and the extent of it was utterly lost in a dim distance; ",36987,37171
383, and he saw animals of every kind wandering about in great numbers. ,37170,37238
384,The first he came to were buffalos; ,37238,37274
385, his surprise was great when they addressed him as human beings. ,37273,37338
386,"They asked him what he came for, how he had descended, and why he was so bold as to visit the abode of the dead. ",37338,37451
387,"He answered that he was in quest of a magic arrow, to appease the anger of his brothers. ",37451,37540
388,"""Very well,"" said the leader of the buffalos, whose form was nothing but bone. ",37540,37619
389,"""Yes, we know it,"" and he and his followers moved off a little space from Maidwa, as if they were afraid of him. ",37619,37732
390,"""You have come,"" resumed the buffalo-spirit, ""to a place where a living man has never before been. ",37732,37831
391,"You will return immediately to your tribe, for, under pretense of recovering one of the magic arrows which belong to you by your father's dying wish, they have sent you off that they might become possessed of your beautiful wife, the Red Swan. ",37831,38075
392,Speed home! ,38075,38087
393,You will find the magic arrow at the lodge-door. ,38087,38136
394,"You will live to a very old age, and die happily. ",38136,38186
395,"You can go no further in these abodes of ours."" ",38186,38234
396,"Maidwa looked, as he thought, to the west, and saw a bright light as if the sun was shining in its splendor, but he saw no sun. ",38234,38362
397,"""What light is that yonder?"" ",38362,38391
398,he asked. ,38391,38401
399,"The all-boned buffalo answered--""It is the place where those who were good dwell."" ",38401,38484
400,"""And that dark cloud?"" ",38484,38507
401,Maidwa again asked. ,38507,38527
402,"""It is the place of the wicked,"" answered the buffalo. ",38527,38582
403,"Maidwa turned away, for it was very dark, and it pained his eyes to look upon it; ",38582,38664
