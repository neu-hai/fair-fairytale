0,"Once there was a woman who had no children, and this made her very unhappy. ",0,76
1,"So she spoke one day to the Sunball, saying: 'Dear Sunball, send me only a little girl now, and when she is twelve years old you may take her back again.' ",76,231
2,"So soon after this the Sunball sent her a little girl, whom the woman called Letiko, and watched over with great care till she was twelve years old. ",231,380
3,"Soon after that, while Letiko was away one day gathering herbs, the Sunball came to her, and said: 'Letiko, when you go home, tell your mother that she must bethink herself of what she promised me.' ",380,579
4,"Then Letiko went straight home, and said to her mother: 'While I was gathering herbs a fine tall gentleman came to me and charged me to tell you that you should remember what you promised him.' ",579,773
5,"When the woman heard that she was sore afraid, and immediately shut all the doors and windows of the house, stopped up all the chinks and holes, and kept Letiko hidden away, that the Sunball should not come and take her away. ",773,999
6,"But she forgot to close up the keyhole, and through it the Sunball sent a ray into the house, which took hold of the little girl and carried her away to him. ",999,1157
7,"One day, the Sunball having sent her to the straw shed to fetch straw, the girl sat down on the piles of straw and bemoaned herself, saying: 'As sighs this straw under my feet so sighs my heart after my mother.' ",1157,1369
8,"And this caused her to be so long away that the Sunball asked her, when she came back: 'Eh, Letiko, where have you been so long?' ",1369,1499
9,"She answered: 'My slippers are too big, and I could not go faster.' ",1499,1567
10,Then the Sunball made the slippers shorter. ,1567,1611
11,"Another time he sent her to fetch water, and when she came to the spring, she sat down and lamented, saying: 'As flows the water even so flows my heart with longing for my mother.' ",1611,1792
12,"Thus she again remained so long away that the Sunball asked her: 'Eh, Letiko, why have you remained so long away?' ",1792,1907
13,And she answered: 'My petticoat is too long and hinders me in walking.' ,1907,1979
14,Then the Sunball cut her petticoat to make it shorter. ,1979,2034
15,"Another time the Sunball sent her to bring him a pair of sandals, and as the girl carried these in her hand she began to lament, saying: 'As creaks the leather so creaks my heart after my little mother.' ",2034,2238
16,"When she came home the Sunball asked her again: 'Eh, Letiko, why do you come home so late?' ",2238,2330
17,"'My red hood is too wide, and falls over my eyes, therefore I could not go fast.' ",2330,2412
18,Then he made the hood narrower. ,2412,2444
19,"At last, however, the Sunball became aware how sad Letiko was. ",2444,2507
20,"He sent her a second time to bring straw, and, slipping in after her, he heard how she lamented for her mother. ",2507,2619
21,"Then he went home, called two foxes to him, and said: 'Will you take Letiko home?' ",2619,2702
22,"'Yes, why not?' ",2702,2718
23,'But what will you eat and drink if you should become hungry and thirsty by the way?' ,2718,2804
24,'We will eat her flesh and drink her blood.' ,2804,2849
25,"When the Sunball heard that, he said: 'You are not suited for this affair.' ",2849,2925
26,"Then he sent them away, and called two hares to him, and said: 'Will you take Letiko home to her mother?' ",2925,3031
27,"'Yes, why not?' ",2702,2718
28,'What will you eat and drink if you should become hungry and thirsty by the way?' ,3047,3129
29,'We will eat grass and drink from streamlets.' ,3129,3176
30,"'Then take her, and bring her home.' ",3176,3213
31,"Then the hares set out, taking Letiko with them, and because it was a long way to her home they became hungry by the way. ",3213,3335
32,"Then they said to the little girl: 'Climb this tree, dear Letiko, and remain there till we have finished eating.' ",3335,3449
33,"So Letiko climbed the tree, and the hares went grazing. ",3449,3505
34,"It was not very long, however, before a lamia came under the tree and called out: 'Letiko, Letiko, come down and see what beautiful shoes I have on.' ",3505,3655
35,'Oh! ,3655,3660
36,my shoes are much finer than yours.' ,3660,3697
37,'Come down. ,3697,3709
38,"I am in a hurry, for my house is not yet swept.' ",3709,3758
39,"'Go home and sweep it then, and come back when you are ready.' ",3758,3821
40,"Then the lamia went away and swept her house, and when she was ready she came back and called out: 'Letiko, Letiko, come down and see what a beautiful apron I have.' ",3821,3987
41,'Oh! ,3655,3660
42,my apron is much finer than yours.' ,3992,4028
43,'If you will not come down I will cut down the tree and eat you.' ,4028,4094
44,"'Do so, and then eat me.' ",4094,4120
45,"Then the lamia hewed with all her strength at the tree, but could not cut it down. ",4120,4203
46,"And when she saw that, she called out: 'Letiko, Letiko, come down, for I must feed my children.' ",4203,4300
47,"'Go home then and feed them, and come back when you are ready.' ",4300,4364
48,"When the lamia was gone away, Letiko called out: 'Little hares! ",4364,4428
49,little hares!' ,4428,4443
50,"Then said one hare to the other: 'Listen, Letiko is calling;'",4443,4504
51,' and they both ran back to her as fast as they could go. ,4503,4561
52,"Then Letiko came down from the tree, and they went on their way. ",4561,4626
53,"The lamia ran as fast as she could after them, to catch them up, and when she came to a field where people were working she asked them: 'Have you seen anyone pass this way?' ",4626,4800
54,They answered: 'We are planting beans.' ,4800,4840
55,'Oh! ,3655,3660
56,I did not ask about that; ,4845,4871
57, but if anyone had passed this way.' ,4870,4907
58,But the people only answered the louder: 'Are you deaf? ,4907,4963
59,"It is beans, beans, beans we are planting.' ",4963,5007
60,"When Letiko had nearly reached her home the dog knew her, and called out, 'Bow wow! ",5007,5091
61,see here comes Letiko!' ,5091,5115
62,"And the mother said, 'Hush! ",5115,5143
63,thou beast of ill-omen! ,5143,5167
64,wilt thou make me burst with misery?' ,5167,5205
65,"Next the cat on the roof saw her, and called out 'Miaouw! ",5205,5263
66,miaouw! ,5263,5271
67,see here comes Letiko!' ,5091,5115
68,"And the mother said, 'Keep silence! ",5295,5331
69,thou beast of ill-omen! ,5143,5167
70,wilt thou make me burst with misery?' ,5167,5205
71,"Then the cock spied, and called out: 'Cock-a-doodle-do! ",5393,5449
72,see here comes Letiko!' ,5091,5115
73,And the mother said again: 'Be quiet! ,5473,5511
74,thou bird of ill-omen! ,5511,5534
75,wilt thou make me burst with misery?' ,5167,5205
76,"The nearer Letiko and the two hares came to the house the nearer also came the lamia, and when the hare was about to slip in by the house door she caught it by its little tail and tore it out. ",5572,5765
77,"When the hare came in the mother stood up and said to it: 'Welcome, dear little hare; ",5765,5851
78, because you have brought me back Letiko I will silver your little tail.' ,5850,5924
79,And she did so; ,5924,5940
80, and lived ever after with her daughter in happiness and content.,5939,6005
