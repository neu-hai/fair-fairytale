30,"After three courses, he who wore the scarlet hat said: ""Quick! ",2586,2649
31,"Make ready the nets and lines for fishing!"" ",2649,2693
32,And at once nets were thrown out into the saucer which held the water in which the scholar dipped his brush. ,2693,2802
33,And they caught hundreds of thousands of fishes. ,2802,2851
34,"The one with the scarlet hat contented himself with casting a line in the shallow waters of the saucer, and caught a baker's dozen of red carp. ",2851,2995

43,He followed them and dug up the earth in the place where they had disappeared. ,3772,3851
