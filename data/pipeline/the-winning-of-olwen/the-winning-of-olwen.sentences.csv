0,"There was once a king and queen who had a little boy, and they called his name Kilweh. ",0,87
1,"The queen, his mother, fell ill soon after his birth, and as she could not take care of him herself she sent him to a woman she knew up in the mountains, so that he might learn to go out in all weathers, and bear heat and cold, and grow tall and strong. ",87,341
2,"Kilweh was quite happy with his nurse, and ran races and climbed hills with the children who were his playfellows, and in the winter, when the snow lay on the ground, sometimes a man with a harp would stop and beg for shelter, and in return would sing them songs of strange things that had happened in the years gone by. ",341,662
3,But long before this changes had taken place in the court of Kilweh's father. ,662,740
4,"Soon after she had sent her baby away the queen became much worse, and at length, seeing that she was going to die, she called her husband to her and said: 'Never again shall I rise from this bed, and by and bye thou wilt take another wife. ",740,981
5,"But lest she should make thee forget thy son, I charge thee that thou take not a wife until thou see a briar with two blossoms upon my grave.' ",981,1124
6,And this he promised her. ,1124,1150
7,Then she further bade him to see to her grave that nothing might grow thereon. ,1150,1229
8,"This likewise he promised her, and soon she died, and for seven years the king sent a man every morning to see that nothing was growing on the queen's grave, but at the end of seven years he forgot. ",1229,1428
9,"One day when the king was out hunting he rode past the place where the queen lay buried, and there he saw a briar growing with two blossoms on it. ",1428,1575
10,"'It is time that I took a wife,' said he, and after long looking he found one. ",1575,1654
11,But he did not tell her about his son; ,1654,1693
12, indeed he hardly remembered that he had one till she heard it at last from an old woman whom she had gone to visit. ,1692,1809
13,"And the new queen was very pleased, and sent messengers to fetch the boy, and in his father's court he stayed, while the years went by till one day the queen told him that a prophecy had foretold that he was to win for his wife Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr. ",1809,2079
14,When he heard this Kilweh felt proud and happy. ,2079,2127
15,"Surely he must be a man now, he thought, or there would be no talk of a wife for him, and his mind dwelt all day upon his promised bride, and what she would be like when he beheld her. ",2127,2312
16,"'What troubles you, my son?' ",2312,2341
17,"asked his father at last, when Kilweh had forgotten something he had been bidden to do, and Kilweh blushed red as he answered: 'My stepmother says that none but Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr, shall be my wife.' ",2341,2564
18,"'That will be easily fulfilled,' replied his father. ",2564,2617
19,'Arthur the king is your cousin. ,2617,2650
20,"Go therefore to him and beg him to cut your hair, and to grant you this boon.' ",2650,2729
21,"Then the youth pricked forth upon a dapple grey horse of four years old, with a bridle of linked gold, and gold upon his saddle. ",2729,2858
22,In his hand he bore two spears of silver with heads of steel; ,2858,2920
23," a war-horn of ivory was slung round his shoulder, and by his side hung a golden sword. ",2919,3007
24,"Before him were two brindled white-breasted greyhounds with collars of rubies round their necks, and the one that was on the left side bounded across to the right side, and the one on the right to the left, and like two sea-swallows sported round him. ",3007,3259
25,"And his horse cast up four sods with his four hoofs, like four swallows in the air about his head, now above, now below. ",3259,3380
26,"About him was a robe of purple, and an apple of gold was at each corner, and every one of the apples was of the value of a hundred cows. ",3380,3517
27,"And the blades of grass bent not beneath him, so light were his horse's feet as he journeyed toward the gate of Arthur's palace. ",3517,3646
28,'Is there a porter?' ,3646,3667
29,"cried Kilweh, looking round for someone to open the gate. ",3667,3725
30,'There is; ,3725,3736
31," and I am Arthur's porter every first day of January,' answered a man coming out to him. ",3735,3824
32,"'The rest of the year there are other porters, and among them Pennpingyon, who goes upon his head to save his feet.' ",3824,3941
33,"'Well, open the portal, I say.' ",3941,3973
34,"'No, that I may not do, for none can enter save the son of a king or a pedlar who has goods to sell. ",3973,4074
35,"But elsewhere there will be food for thy dogs and hay for thy horse, and for thee collops cooked and peppered, and sweet wine shall be served in the guest chamber.' ",4074,4239
36,"'That will not do for me,' answered Kilweh. ",4239,4283
37,"'If thou wilt not open the gate I will send up three shouts that shall be heard from Cornwall unto the north, and yet again to Ireland.' ",4283,4420
38,"'Whatever clamour you may make,' spake Glewlwyd the porter, 'you shall not enter until I first go and speak with Arthur.' ",4420,4542
39,"Then Glewlwyd went into the hall, and Arthur said to him: 'Do you have news from the gate?' ",4542,4634
40,"and the porter answered: 'Far have I travelled, both in this island and elsewhere, and many kingly men have I seen; ",4634,4750
41, but never yet have I beheld one equal in majesty to him who now stands at the door.' ,4749,4835
42,"'If walking you did enter here, return you running,' replied Arthur, 'and let everyone that opens and shuts the eye show him respect and serve him, for it is not meet to keep such a man in the wind and rain.' ",4835,5044
43,So Glewlwyd unbarred the gate and Kilweh rode in upon his charger. ,5044,5111
44,"'Greeting to you, O ruler of this land,' cried he, 'and greeting no less to the lowest than to the highest.' ",5111,5220
45,"'Greeting to you also,' answered Arthur. ",5220,5261
46,"'Sit between two of my warriors, and you shall have minstrels before you and all that belongs to one born to be a king, while you remain in my palace.' ",5261,5413
47,"'I am not come,' replied Kilweh, 'for meat and drink, but to obtain a boon, and if you grant it me I will pay it back, and will carry thy praise to the four winds of heaven. ",5413,5587
48,"But if you wilt not grant it to me, then I will proclaim your discourtesy wherever your name is known.' ",5587,5691
49,"'What you ask that shall you receive,' said Arthur, 'as far as the wind dries and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves and the sea encircles and the earth extends. ",5691,5858
50,"Save only my ship and my mantle, my word and my lance, my shield and my dagger, and Guinevere my wife.' ",5858,5962
51,"'I would that you bless my hair,' spake Kilweh, and Arthur answered: 'That shall be granted to you.' ",5962,6063
52,"Forthwith he bade his men fetch him a comb of gold and a scissors with loops of silver, and he combed the hair of Kilweh his guest. ",6063,6195
53,"'Tell me who you are,' he said, 'for my heart warms to you, and I feel you are come of my blood.' ",6195,6293
54,"'I am Kilweh, son of Kilydd,' replied the youth. ",6293,6342
55,"'Then my cousin you are in truth,' replied Arthur, 'and whatever boon you may ask you shall receive.' ",6342,6444
56,"'The boon I crave is that you may win for me Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr, and this boon I seek likewise at the hands of thy warriors. ",6444,6592
57,"From Sol, who can stand all day upon one foot; ",6592,6639
58," from Ossol, who, if he were to find himself on the top of the highest mountain in the world, could make it into a level plain in the beat of a bird's wing; ",6638,6795
59," from Cluse, who, though he were buried under the earth, could yet hear the ant leave her nest fifty miles away: from these and from Kai and from Bedwyr and from all thy mighty men I crave this boon.' ",6794,6995
60,"'O Kilweh,' said Arthur, 'never have I heard of the maiden of whom you speak of, nor of her kindred, but I will send messengers to seek her if you will give me time.' ",6995,7162
61,"'From this night to the end of the year right willingly will I grant you,' replied Kilweh; ",7162,7253
62," but when the end of the year came and the messengers returned Kilweh was wroth, and spoke rough words to Arthur. ",7252,7366
63,"It was Kai, the boldest of the warriors and the swiftest of foot--he would could pass nine nights without sleep, and nine days beneath the water--that answered him: 'Rash youth that you are, you are speak thus to Arthur? ",7366,7587
64,"Come with us, and we will not part company till we have won that maiden, or till you confess that there is none such in the world.' ",7587,7719
65,Then Arthur summoned his five best men and bade them go with Kilweh. ,7719,7788
66,"There was Bedwyr the one-handed, Kai's comrade and brother in arms, the swiftest man in Britain save Arthur; ",7788,7897
67," there was Kynddelig, who knew the paths in a land where he had never been as surely as he did those of his own country; ",7896,8017
68," there was Gwrhyr, that could speak all tongues; ",8016,8065
69," and Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, who never returned till he had gained what he sought; ",8064,8151
70," and last of all there was Menw, who could weave a spell over them so that none might see them, while they could see everyone. ",8150,8277
71,So these seven journeyed together till they reached a vast open plain in which was a fair castle. ,8277,8375
72,"But though it seemed so close it was not until the evening of the third day that they really drew near to it, and in front of it a flock of sheep was spread, so many in number that there seemed no end to them. ",8375,8585
73,"A shepherd stood on a mound watching over them, and by his side was a dog, as large as a horse nine winters old. ",8585,8698
74,"'Whose is this castle, O herdsmen?' ",8698,8734
75,asked the knights. ,8734,8753
76,"'You are truly stupid,' answered the herdsman. ",8753,8800
77,'All the world knows that this is the castle of Yspaddaden Penkawr.' ,8800,8869
78,'And who are you?' ,8869,8888
79,"'I am called Custennin, brother of Yspaddaden, and ill has he treated me. ",8888,8962
80,"And who are you, and what do you here?' ",8962,9002
81,"'We come from Arthur the king, to seek Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden,' but at this news the shepherd gave a cry: 'O men, be warned and turn back while there is yet time. ",9002,9175
82,"Others have gone on that quest, but none have escaped to tell the tale,' and he rose to his feet as if to leave them. ",9175,9293
83,"Then Kilweh held out to him a ring of gold, and he tried to put it on his finger, but it was too small, so he placed it in his glove, and went home and gave it to his wife. ",9293,9466
84,'Where did this ring come from?' ,9466,9499
85,"asked she, 'for such good luck is not wont to befall on you .' ",9499,9562
86,"'The man to whom this ring belonged you shall see here in the evening,' answered the shepherd; ",9562,9657
87," 'he is Kilweh, son of Kilydd, cousin to king Arthur, and he has come to seek Olwen.' ",9656,9742
88,"And when the wife heard that she knew that Kilweh was her nephew, and her heart yearned after him, half with joy at the thought of seeing him, and half with sorrow for the doom she feared. ",9742,9931
89,"Soon they heard steps approaching, and Kai and the rest entered into the house and ate and drank. ",9931,10029
90,"After that the woman opened a chest, and out of it came a youth with curling yellow hair. ",10029,10119
91,"'It is a pity to hid him thus,' said Gwrhyr, 'for well I know that he has done no evil.' ",10119,10208
92,"'Three and twenty of my sons has Yspaddaden slain, and I have no more hope of saving this one,' replied she, and Kai was full of sorrow and answered: 'Let him come with me and be my comrade, and he shall never be slain unless I am slain also.' ",10208,10452
93,And so it was agreed. ,10452,10474
94,'What is your errand here?' ,10474,10502
95,asked the woman. ,10502,10519
96,"'We seek Olwen the maiden for this youth,' answered Kai; ",10519,10576
97, 'does she ever come hither so that she may be seen?' ,10575,10629
98,"'She comes every Saturday to wash her hair, and in the vessel where she washes she leaves all her rings, and never does she so much as send a messenger to fetch them.' ",10629,10797
99,'Will she come if she is bidden?' ,10797,10831
100,"asked Kai, pondering. ",10831,10853
101,'She will come; ,10853,10869
102, but unless you pledge me your faith that you will not harm her I will not fetch her.' ,10868,10955
103,"'We pledge it,' said they, and the maiden came. ",10955,11003
104,"A fair sight was she in a robe of flame-coloured silk, with a collar of ruddy gold about her neck, bright with emeralds and rubies. ",11003,11135
105,"More yellow was her head than the flower of the broom, and her skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands than the blossoms of the wood anemone. ",11135,11306
106,"Four white trefoils sprang up where she trod, and therefore was she called Olwen. ",11306,11388
107,"She entered, and sat down on a bench beside Kilweh, and he spake to her: 'Ah, maiden, since first I heard thy name I have loved thee--will you not come away with me from this evil place?' ",11388,11576
108,"'That I cannot do,' answered she, 'for I have given my word to my father not to go without his knowledge, for his life will only last till I am betrothed. ",11576,11731
109,"Whatever is, must be, but this counsel I will give you. ",11731,11787
110,"Go, and ask me of my father, and whatsoever he shall required of you grant it, and you shall win me; ",11787,11888
111," but if thou deny him anything thou wilt not obtain me, and it will be well for you if you escape with thy life.' ",11887,12001
112,"'All this I promise,' said he. ",12001,12032
113,"So she returned to the castle, and all Arthur's men went after her, and entered the hall. ",12032,12122
114,"'Greeting to thee, Yspaddaden Penkawr,' said they. ",12122,12173
115,"'We come to ask thy daughter Olwen for Kilweh, son of Kilydd.' ",12173,12236
116,"'Come hither to-morrow and I will answer you,' replied Yspaddaden Penkawr, and as they rose to leave the hall he caught up one of the three poisoned darts that lay beside him and flung it in their midst. ",12236,12440
117,"But Bedwyr saw and caught it, and flung it back so hard that it pierced the knee of Yspaddaden. ",12440,12536
118,"'A gentle son-in-law, truly!' ",12536,12566
119,"he cried, writhing with pain. ",12566,12596
120,'I shall ever walk the worse for this rudeness. ,12596,12644
121,"Cursed be the smith who forged it, and the anvil on which it was wrought!' ",12644,12719
122,"That night the men slept in the house of Custennin the herdsman, and the next day they proceeded to the castle, and entered the hall, and said: 'Yspaddaden Penkawr, give us thy daughter and thou shalt keep her dower. ",12719,12936
123,And unless thou wilt do this we will slay thee.' ,12936,12985
124,"'Her four great grandmothers and her four great grandfathers yet live,' answered Yspaddaden Penkawr; ",12985,13086
125, 'it is needful that I take counsel with them.' ,13085,13133
126,'Be it so; ,13133,13144
127," we will go to meat,' but as they turned he took up the second dart that lay by his side and cast it after them. ",13143,13256
128,"And Menw caught it, and flung it at him, and wounded him in the chest, so that it came out at his back. ",13256,13360
129,"'A gentle son-in-law, truly!' ",12536,12566
130,"cried Yspaddaden, 'the iron pains me like the bite of a horse-leech. ",13390,13459
131,"Cursed be the hearth whereon it was heated, and the smith who formed it!' ",13459,13533
132,The third day Arthur's men returned to the palace into the presence of Yspaddaden. ,13533,13616
133,"'Shoot not at me again,' said he, 'unless you desire death. ",13616,13676
134,"But lift up my eyebrows, which have fallen over my eyes, that I may see my son-in-law.' ",13676,13764
135,"Then they arose, and as they did so Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them. ",13764,13869
136,"And Kilweh caught it, and flung it back, and it passed through his eyeball, and came out on the other side of his head. ",13869,13989
137,"'A gentle son-in-law, truly!'",12536,12565
138,Cursed be the fire in which it was forged and the man who fashioned it!' ,14018,14091
139,"The next day Arthur's men came again to the palace and said: 'Shoot not at us any more unless thou desirest more pain than even now thou hast, but give us thy daughter without more words.' ",14091,14280
140,'Where is he that seeks my daughter? ,14280,14317
141,Let him come hither so that I may see him.' ,14317,14361
142,And Kilweh sat himself in a chair and spoke face to face with him. ,14361,14428
143,'Is it you that seekest my daughter?' ,14428,14466
144,"'It is I,' answered Kilweh. ",14466,14494
145,"'First give me your word that you will do nothing towards me that is not just, and when thou hast won for me that which I shall ask, then you shall wed my daughter.' ",14494,14660
146,"'I promise right willingly,' said Kilweh. ",14660,14702
147,'Name what you will.' ,14702,14724
148,'You see the hill over there? ,14724,14754
149,"Well, in one day it shall be rooted up and ploughed and sown, and the grain shall ripen, and of that wheat I will bake the cakes for my daughter's wedding.' ",14754,14911
150,"'It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest deem it will not be easy,' answered Kilweh, thinking of Ossol, under whose feet the highest mountain became straightway a plain, but Yspaddaden paid no heed, and continued: 'You see that field over there? ",14911,15178
151,"When my daughter was born nine bushels of flax were sown therein, and not one blade has sprung up. ",15178,15277
152,I require thee to sow fresh flax in the ground that my daughter may wear a veil spun from it on the day of her wedding.' ,15277,15398
153,'It will be easy for me to compass this.' ,15398,15440
154,'Though you compass this there is that which you will not compass. ,15440,15507
155,For you must bring me the basket of Gwyddneu Garanhir which will give meat to the whole world. ,15507,15602
156,It is for thy wedding feast. ,15602,15631
157,"You must also fetch me the drinking-horn that is never empty, and the harp that never ceases to play until it is bidden. ",15631,15752
158,"Also the comb and scissors and razor that lie between the two ears of Trwyth the boar, so that I may arrange my hair for the wedding. ",15752,15886
159,"And though thou get this yet there is that which thou wilt not get, for Trwyth the boar will not let any man take from him the comb and the scissors, unless Drudwyn the whelp hunt him. ",15886,16071
160,"But no leash in the world can hold Drudwyn save the leash of Cant Ewin, and no collar will hold the leash except the collar of Canhastyr.' ",16071,16210
161,"'It will be easy for me to compass this, though thou mayest think it will not be easy,' Kilweh answered him. ",16210,16319
162,'Though you get all these things yet there is that which thou wilt not get. ,16319,16395
163,Throughout the world there is none that can hunt with this dog save Mabon the son of Modron. ,16395,16488
164,"He was taken from his mother when three nights old, and it is not know where he now is, nor whether he is living or dead, and though you find him yet the boar will never be slain save only with the sword of Gwrnach the giant, and if you obtain it not neither shalt thou obtain my daughter.' ",16488,16779
165,"'Horses shall I have, and knights from my lord Arthur. ",16779,16834
166,"And I shall gain your daughter, and thou shalt lose thy life.' ",16834,16897
167,The speech of Kilweh the son of Kilydd with Yspaddaden Penkawr was ended. ,16897,16971
168,"Then Arthur's men set forth, and Kilweh with them, and journeyed till they reached the largest castle in the world, and a black man came out to meet them. ",16971,17126
169,"'Where did you come from, O man?' ",17126,17160
170,"asked they, 'and whose is that castle?' ",17160,17200
171,"'That is the castle of Gwrnach the giant, as all the world knows,' answered the man, 'but no guest ever returned thence alive, and none may enter the gate except a craftsman, who brings his trade.' ",17200,17398
172,"But little did Arthur's men heed his warning, and they went straight to the gate. ",17398,17480
173,'Open!' ,17480,17488
174,cried Gwrhyr. ,17488,17502
175,"'I will not open,' replied the porter. ",17502,17541
176,'And wherefore?' ,17541,17558
177,asked Kai. ,17558,17569
178,"'The knife is in the meat, and the drink is in the horn, and there is revelry in the hall of Gwrnach the giant, and save for a craftsman who brings his trade the gate will not be opened to-night.' ",17569,17766
179,"'Verily, then, I may enter,' said Kai, 'for there is no better burnisher of swords than I.' ",17766,17858
180,"'This will I tell Gwrnach the giant, and I will bring thee his answer.' ",17858,17930
181,"'Bid the man come before me,' cried Gwrnach, when the porter had told his tale, 'for my sword stands much in need of polishing,' so Kai passed in and saluted Gwrnach the giant. ",17930,18107
182,"'Is it true what I hear of thee, that you can burnish swords?' ",18107,18170
183,"'It is true,' answered Kai. ",18170,18198
184,Then was the sword of Gwrnach brought to him. ,18198,18244
185,'Shall it be burnished white or blue?' ,18244,18283
186,"said Kai, taking a whetstone from under his arm. ",18283,18332
187,"'As you will,' answered the giant, and speedily did Kai polish half the sword. ",18332,18411
188,"The giant marvelled at his skill, and said: 'It is a wonder that such a man as you should be without a companion.' ",18411,18526
189,"'I have a companion, noble sir, but he has no skill in this art.' ",18526,18592
190,'What is his name?' ,18592,18612
191,asked the giant. ,18612,18629
192,"'Let the porter go forth, and I will tell him how he may know him. ",18629,18696
193,"The head of his lance will leave its shaft, and draw blood from the wind, and descend upon its shaft again.' ",18696,18805
194,So the porter opened the gate and Bedwyr entered. ,18805,18855
195,"Now there was much talk amongst those who remained without when the gate closed upon Bedwyr, and Goreu, son of Custennin, prevailed with the porter, and he and his companions got in also and hid themselves. ",18855,19062
196,"By this time the whole of the sword was polished, and Kai gave it into the hand of Gwrnach the giant, who felt it and said: 'Your work is good; ",19062,19206
197, I am content.' ,19205,19221
198,Then said Kai: 'It is your scabbard that has rusted thy sword; ,19221,19284
199, give it to me that I may take out the wooden sides of it and put in new ones.' ,19283,19363
200,"And he took the scabbard in one hand and the sword in the other, and came and stood behind the giant, as if he would have sheathed the sword in the scabbard. ",19363,19521
201,"But with it he struck a blow at the head of the giant, and it rolled from his body. ",19521,19605
202,"After that they despoiled the castle of its gold and jewels, and returned, bearing the sword of the giant, to Arthur's court. ",19605,19731
203,"They told Arthur how they had sped, and they all took counsel together, and agreed that they must set out on the quest for Mabon the son of Modron, and Gwrhyr, who knew the languages of beasts and of birds, went with them. ",19731,19954
204,"So they journeyed until they came to the nest of an ousel, and Gwrhyr spoke to her. ",19954,20038
205,"'Tell me if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken when three nights old from between his mother and the wall.' ",20038,20172
206,"And the ousel answered: 'When I first came here I was a young bird, and there was a smith's anvil in this place. ",20172,20285
207,"But from that time no work has been done upon it, save that every evening I have pecked at it, till now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining thereof. ",20285,20450
208,Yet all that time I have never once heard of the man you name. ,20450,20513
209,"Still, there is a race of beasts older than I, and I will guide you to them.' ",20513,20591
210,"So the ousel flew before them, till she reached the stag of Redynvre; ",20591,20661
211, but when they inquired of the stag whether he knew aught of Mabon he shook his head. ,20660,20746
212,"'When first I came hither,' said he, 'the plain was bare save for one oak sapling, which grew up to be an oak with a hundred branches. ",20746,20881
213,"All that is left of that oak is a withered stump, but never once have I heard of the man you name. ",20881,20980
214,"Nevertheless, as you are Arthur's men, I will guide you to the place where there is an animal older than I';",20980,21088
215, and the stag ran before them till he reached the owl of Cwm Cawlwyd. ,21088,21158
216,But when they inquired of the owl if he knew aught of Mabon he shook his head. ,21158,21237
217,"'When first I came hither,' said he, 'the valley was a wooded glen; ",21237,21305
218, then a race of men came and rooted it up. ,21304,21347
219,"After that there grew a second wood, and then a third, which you see. ",21347,21417
220,Look at my wings also--are they not withered stumps? ,21417,21470
221,Yet until to-day I have never heard of the man you name. ,21470,21527
222,"Still, I will guide you to the oldest animal in the world, and the one that has travelled most, the eagle of Gwern Abbey.' ",21527,21650
223,"And he flew before them, as fast as his old wings would carry him, till he reached the eagle of Gwern Abbey, but when they inquired of the eagle whether he knew aught of Mabon he shook his head. ",21650,21845
224,"'When I first came hither,' said the eagle, 'there was a rock here, and every evening I pecked at the stars from the top of it. ",21845,21973
225,"Now, behold, it is not even a span high! ",21973,22014
226,"But only once have I heard of the man you name, and that was when I went in search of food as far as Llyn Llyw. ",22014,22126
227,"I swooped down upon a salmon, and struck my claws into him, but he drew me down under water till scarcely could I escape him. ",22126,22252
228,"Then I summoned all my kindred to destroy him, but he made peace with me, and I took fifty fish spears from his back. ",22252,22370
229,Unless he may know something of the man whom you seek I cannot tell who may. ,22370,22447
230,But I will guide you to the place where he is.' ,22447,22495
231,"So they followed the eagle, who flew before them, though so high was he in the sky, it was often hard to mark his flight. ",22495,22617
232,At length he stopped above a deep pool in a river. ,22617,22668
233,"'Salmon of Llyn Llyw,' he called, 'I have come to thee with an embassy from Arthur to inquire if thou knowest aught concerning Mabon the son of Modron.' ",22668,22821
234,And the salmon answered: 'As much as I know I will tell thee. ,22821,22883
235,"With every tide I go up the river, till I reach the walls of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as I never found elsewhere. ",22883,23018
236,And that you may see that what I say is true let two of you go thither on my shoulders.' ,23018,23107
237,"So Kai and Gwrhyr went upon the shoulders of the salmon, and were carried under the walls of the prison, from which proceeded the sound of great weeping. ",23107,23261
238,'Who is it that thus laments in this house of stone?' ,23261,23315
239,"'It is I, Mabon the son of Modron.' ",23315,23351
240,"'Will silver or gold bring thy freedom, or only battle and fighting?' ",23351,23421
241,asked Gwrhyr again. ,23421,23441
242,"'By fighting alone shall I be set free,' said Mabon. ",23441,23494
243,"Then they sent a messenger to Arthur to tell him that Mabon was found, and he brought all his warriors to the castle of Gloucester and fell fiercely upon it; ",23494,23652
244," while Kai and Bedwyr went on the shoulders of the salmon to the gate of the dungeon, and broke it down and carried away Mabon. ",23651,23779
245,And he now being free returned home with Arthur. ,23779,23828
246,"After this, on a certain day, as Gwythyr was walking across a mountain he heard a grievous cry, and he hastened towards it. ",23828,23952
247,"In a little valley he saw the heather burning and the fire spreading fast towards the anthill, and all the ants were hurrying to and fro, not knowing whither to go. ",23952,24117
248,"Gwythyr had pity on them, and put out the fire, and in gratitude the ants brought him the nine bushels of flax seed which Yspaddaden Penkawr required of Kilweh. ",24117,24278
249,"And many of the other marvels were done likewise by Arthur and his knights, and at last it came to the fight with Trwyth the board, to obtain the comb and the scissors and the razor that lay between his ears. ",24278,24487
250,"But hard was the boar to catch, and fiercely did he fight when Arthur's men gave him battle, so that many of them were slain. ",24487,24613
251,"Up and down the country went Trwyth the boar, and Arthur followed after him, till they came to the Severn sea. ",24613,24724
252,"There three knights caught his feet unawares and plunged him into the water, while one snatched the razor from him, and another seized the scissors. ",24724,24873
253,"But before they laid hold of the comb he had shaken them all off, and neither man nor horse nor dog could reach him till he came to Cornwall, whither Arthur had sworn he should not go. ",24873,25058
254,"Thither Arthur followed after him with his knights, and if it had been hard to win the razor and the scissors, the struggle for the comb was fiercer still, but at length Arthur prevailed, and the boar was driven into the sea. ",25058,25284
255,And whether he was drowned or where he went no man knows to this day. ,25284,25354
256,"In the end all the marvels were done, and Kilweh set forward, and with him Goreu, the son of Custennin, to Yspaddaden Penkawr, bearing in their hands the razor, the scissors and the comb, and Yspaddaden Penkawr was shaved by Kaw. ",25354,25584
257,'Is your daughter mine now?' ,25584,25613
258,asked Kilweh. ,25613,25627
259,"'She is yours,' answered Yspaddaden, 'but it is Arthur and none other who has won her for you. ",25627,25722
260,"Of my own free will you should never have had her, for now I must lose my life.' ",25722,25803
261,"And as he spake Goreu the son of Custennin cut off his head, as if had been ordained, and Arthur's hosts returned each man to his own country.",25803,25946
