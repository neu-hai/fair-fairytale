0,Once upon a time there was a great lord who had three sons. ,0,60
1,"He fell very ill, sent for doctors of every kind, even bonesetters, but they, none of them, could find out what was the matter with him, or even give him any relief. ",60,226
2,"At last there came a foreign doctor, who declared that the Golden Blackbird alone could cure the sick man. ",226,333
3,"So the old lord despatched his eldest son to look for the wonderful bird, and promised him great riches if he managed to find it and bring it back. ",333,481
4,"The young man began his journey, and soon arrived at a place where four roads met. ",481,564
5,"He did not know which to choose, and tossed his cap in the air, determining that the direction of its fall should decide him. ",564,690
6,"After travelling for two or three days, he grew tired of walking without knowing where or for how long, and he stopped at an inn which was filled with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink. ",690,893
7,"'My faith,' said he, 'it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting for this bird. ",893,975
8,"My father is old, and if he dies I shall inherit his goods.' ",975,1036
9,"The old man, after waiting patiently for some time, sent his second son to seek the Golden Blackbird. ",1036,1138
10,"The youth took the same direction as his brother, and when he came to the cross roads, he too tossed up which road he should take. ",1138,1269
11,"The cap fell in the same place as before, and he walked on till he came to the spot where his brother had halted. ",1269,1383
12,"The latter, who was leaning out of the window of the inn, called to him to stay where he was and amuse himself. ",1383,1495
13,"'You are right,' replied the youth. ",1495,1531
14,"'Who knows if I should ever find the Golden Blackbird, even if I sought the whole world through for it. ",1531,1635
15,"At the worst, if the old man dies, we shall have his property.' ",1635,1699
16,"He entered the inn and the two brothers made merry and feasted, till very soon their money was all spent. ",1699,1805
17,"They even owed something to their landlord, who kept them as hostages till they could pay their debts. ",1805,1908
18,"The youngest son set forth in his turn, and he arrived at the place where his brothers were still prisoners. ",1908,2017
19,"They called to him to stop, and did all they could to prevent his going further. ",2017,2098
20,"'No,' he replied, 'my father trusted me, and I will go all over the world till I find the Golden Blackbird.' ",2098,2207
21,"'Bah,' said his brothers, 'you will never succeed any better than we did. ",2207,2281
22,Let him die if he wants to; ,2281,2309
23, we will divide the property.' ,2308,2339
24,"As he went his way he met a little hare, who stopped to look at him, and asked: 'Where are you going, my friend?' ",2339,2453
25,"'I really don't quite know,' answered he. ",2453,2495
26,"'My father is ill, and he cannot be cured unless I bring him back the Golden Blackbird. ",2495,2583
27,"It is a long time since I set out, but no one can tell me where to find it.' ",2583,2660
28,"'Ah,' said the hare, 'you have a long way to go yet. ",2660,2713
29,You will have to walk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it.' ,2713,2787
30,'And how am I to travel such a distance?' ,2787,2829
31,"'Mount on my back,' said the little hare, 'and I will conduct you.' ",2829,2897
32,"The young man obeyed: at each bound the little hare went seven miles, and it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large and beautiful as a castle could be. ",2897,3070
33,"'The Golden Blackbird is in a little cabin near by,' said the little hare, 'and you will easily find it. ",3070,3175
34,"It lives in a little cage, with another cage beside it made all of gold. ",3175,3248
35,"But whatever you do, be sure not to put it in the beautiful cage, or everybody in the castle will know that you have stolen it.' ",3248,3377
36,"The youth found the Golden Blackbird standing on a wooden perch, but as stiff and rigid as if he was dead. ",3377,3484
37,And beside the beautiful cage was the cage of gold. ,3484,3536
38,"'Perhaps he would revive if I were to put him in that lovely cage,' thought the youth. ",3536,3623
39,"The moment that Golden Bird had touched the bars of the splendid cage he awoke, and began to whistle, so that all the servants of the castle ran to see what was the matter, saying that he was a thief and must be put in prison. ",3623,3850
40,"'No,' he answered, 'I am not a thief. ",3850,3888
41,"If I have taken the Golden Blackbird, it is only that it may cure my father, who is ill, and I have travelled more than seven hundred miles in order to find it.' ",3888,4050
42,"'Well,' they replied, 'we will let you go, and will even give you the Golden Bird, if you are able to bring us the Porcelain Maiden.' ",4050,4184
43,"The youth departed, weeping, and met the little hare, who was munching wild thyme. ",4184,4267
44,"'What are you crying for, my friend?' ",4267,4305
45,asked the hare. ,4305,4321
46,"'It is because,' he answered, 'the castle people will not allow me to carry off the Golden Blackbird without giving them the Porcelain Maiden in exchange.' ",4321,4477
47,"'You have not followed my advice,' said the little hare. ",4477,4534
48,'And you have put the Golden Bird into the fine cage.' ,4534,4589
49,'Alas! ,4589,4596
50,yes!' ,4596,4602
51,'Don't despair! ,4602,4618
52,"the Porcelain Maiden is a young girl, beautiful as Venus, who dwells two hundred miles from here. ",4618,4716
53,Jump on my back and I will take you there.' ,4716,4760
54,"The little hare, who took seven miles in a stride, was there in no time at all, and he stopped on the borders of a lake. ",4760,4881
55,"'The Porcelain Maiden,' said the hare to the youth, 'will come here to bathe with her friends, while I just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh me. ",4881,5028
56,"When she is in the lake, be sure you hide her clothes, which are of dazzling whiteness, and do not give them back to her unless she consents to follow you.' ",5028,5185
57,"The little hare left him, and almost immediately the Porcelain Maiden arrived with her friends. ",5185,5281
58,She undressed herself and got into the water. ,5281,5327
59,"Then the young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of her clothes, which he hid under a rock at some distance. ",5327,5442
60,"When the Porcelain Maiden was tired of playing in the water she came out to dress herself, but, though she hunted for her clothes high and low, she could find them nowhere. ",5442,5615
61,"Her friends helped her in the search, but, seeing at last that it was of no use, they left her, alone on the bank, weeping bitterly. ",5615,5748
62,'Why do you cry?' ,5748,5766
63,"said the young man, approaching her. ",5766,5803
64,'Alas!' ,5803,5811
65,"answered she, 'while I was bathing someone stole my clothes, and my friends have abandoned me.' ",5811,5907
66,'I will find your clothes if you will only come with me.' ,5907,5965
67,"And the Porcelain Maiden agreed to follow him, and after having given up her clothes, the young man bought a small horse for her, which went like the wind. ",5965,6121
68,"The little hare brought them both back to seek for the Golden Blackbird, and when they drew near to the castle where it lived the little hero said to the young man: 'Now, do be a little sharper than you were before, and you will manage to carry off both the Golden Blackbird and the Porcelain Maiden. ",6121,6422
69,"Take the golden cage in one hand, and leave the bird in the old cage where he is, and bring that away too.' ",6422,6530
70,The little hare then vanished; ,6530,6561
71," the youth did as he was bid, and the castle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the Golden Bird. ",6560,6670
72,"When he reached the inn where his brothers were detained, he delivered them by paying their debt. ",6670,6768
73,"They set out all together, but as the two elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngest, they took the opportunity as they were passing by the shores of a lake to throw themselves upon him, seize the Golden Bird, and fling him in the water. ",6768,7022
74,"Then they continued their journey, taking with them the Porcelain Maiden, in the firm belief that their brother was drowned. ",7022,7147
75,"But, happily, he had snatched in falling at a tuft of rushes and called loudly for help. ",7147,7236
76,"The little hare came running to him, and said 'Take hold of my leg and pull yourself out of the water.' ",7236,7340
77,"When he was safe on shore the little hare said to him: 'Now this is what you have to do: dress yourself like a Breton seeking a place as stable-boy, and go and offer your services to your father. ",7340,7536
78,"Once there, you will easily be able to make him understand the truth.' ",7536,7607
79,"The young man did as the little hare bade him, and he went to his father's castle and enquired if they were not in want of a stable-boy. ",7607,7744
80,"'Yes,' replied his father, 'very much indeed. ",7744,7790
81,But it is not an easy place. ,7790,7819
82,"There is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyone go near it, and it has already kicked to death several people who have tried to groom it.' ",7819,7974
83,"'I will undertake to groom it,' said the youth. ",7974,8022
84,'I never saw the horse I was afraid of yet.' ,8022,8067
85,The little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down without a toss of its head and without a kick. ,8067,8164
86,'Good gracious!' ,8164,8181
87,exclaimed the master; ,8181,8203
88," 'how is it that he lets you touch him, when no one else can go near him?' ",8202,8277
89,"'Perhaps he knows me,' answered the stable-boy. ",8277,8325
90,"Two or three days later the master said to him: 'The Porcelain Maiden is here: but, though she is as lovely as the dawn, she is so wicked that she scratches everyone that approaches her. ",8325,8512
91,Try if she will accept your services.' ,8512,8551
92,"When the youth entered the room where she was, the Golden Blackbird broke forth into a joyful song, and the Porcelain Maiden sang too, and jumped for joy. ",8551,8706
93,'Good gracious!' ,8164,8181
94,cried the master. ,8723,8741
95,'The Porcelain Maiden and the Golden Blackbird know you too?' ,8741,8803
96,"'Yes,' replied the youth, 'and the Porcelain Maiden can tell you the whole truth, if she only will.' ",8803,8904
97,"Then she told all that had happened, and how she had consented to follow the young man who had captured the Golden Blackbird. ",8904,9030
98,"'Yes,' added the youth, 'I delivered my brothers, who were kept prisoners in an inn, and, as a reward, they threw me into a lake. ",9030,9160
99,"So I disguised myself and came here, in order to prove the truth to you.' ",9160,9234
100,"So the old lord embraced his son, and promised that he should inherit all his possessions, and he put to death the two elder ones, who had deceived him and had tried to slay their own brother. ",9234,9427
101,"The young man married the Porcelain Maiden, and had a splendid wedding-feast.",9427,9505
