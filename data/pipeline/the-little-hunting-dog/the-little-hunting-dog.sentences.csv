0,"Once upon a time, in the city of Shansi, there lived a scholar who found the company of others too noisy for him. ",0,114
1,So he made his home in a Buddhist temple. ,114,156
2,Yet he suffered because there were always so many gnats and fleas in his room that he could not sleep at night. ,156,268
3,"Once he was resting on his bed after dinner, when suddenly two little knights with plumes in their helmets rode into the room. ",268,395
4,"They might have been two inches high, and rode horses about the size of grasshoppers. ",395,481
5,On their gauntleted hands they held hunting falcons as large as flies. ,481,552
6,They rode about the room with great rapidity. ,552,598
7,"The scholar had no more than set eyes on them when a third entered, clad like the others, but carrying a bow and arrows and leading a little hunting dog the size of an ant with him. ",598,780
8,"After him came a great throng of footmen and horsemen, several hundred in all. ",780,859
9,"And they had hunting falcons and hunting dogs by the hundred, too. ",859,926
10,Then the fleas and gnats began to rise in the air; ,926,977
11, but were all slain by the falcons. ,976,1012
12,"And the hunting dogs climbed on the bed, and sniffed along the walls trailing the fleas, and ate them up. ",1012,1118
13,"They followed the trace of whatever hid in the cracks, and nosed it out, so that in a short space of time they had killed nearly all the vermin. ",1118,1263
14,The scholar pretended to be asleep and watched them. ,1263,1316
15,"And the falcons settled down on him, and the dogs crawled along his body. ",1316,1390
16,"Shortly after came a man clad in yellow, wearing a king's crown, who climbed on an empty couch and seated himself there. ",1390,1511
17,"And at once all the horsemen rode up, descended from their horses and brought him all the birds and game. ",1511,1617
18,"They then gathered beside him in a great throng, and conversed with him in a strange tongue. ",1617,1710
19,Not long after the king got into a small chariot and his bodyguards saddled their horses with the greatest rapidity. ,1710,1827
20,"Then they galloped out with great cries of homage, till it looked as though some one were scattering beans and a heavy cloud of dust rose behind them. ",1827,1978
21,"They had nearly all of them disappeared, while the scholar's eyes were still fixed on them full of terror and astonishment, and he could not imagine whence they had come. ",1978,2149
22,He slipped on his shoes and looked; ,2149,2185
23, but they had vanished without a trace. ,2184,2224
24,Then he returned and looked all about his room; ,2224,2272
25, but there was nothing to be seen. ,2271,2306
26,"Only, on a brick against the wall, they had forgotten a little hunting dog. ",2306,2382
27,The scholar quickly caught it and found it quite tame. ,2382,2437
28,He put it in his paint-box and examined it closely. ,2437,2489
29,"It had a very smooth, fine coat, and wore a little collar around its neck. ",2489,2564
30,"He tried to feed it a few bread-crumbs, but the little dog only sniffed at them and let them lie. ",2564,2662
31,"Then it leaped into the bed and hunted up some nits and gnats in the folds of the linen, which it devoured. ",2662,2770
32,Then it returned and lay down. ,2770,2801
33,When the night had passed the scholar feared it might have run away; ,2801,2870
34," but there it lay, curled up as before. ",2869,2909
35,"Whenever the scholar went to bed, the dog climbed into it and bit to death any vermin it could find. ",2909,3010
36,Not a fly or gnat dared alight while it was around. ,3010,3062
37,The scholar loved it like a jewel of price. ,3062,3106
38,"But once he took a nap in the daytime, and the little dog crawled into bed beside him. ",3106,3193
39,"The scholar woke and turned around, supporting himself on his side. ",3193,3261
40,"As he did so he felt something, and feared it might be his little dog. ",3261,3332
41,"He quickly rose and looked, but it was already dead--pressed flat, as though cut out of paper! ",3332,3427
42,But at any rate none of the vermin had survived it.,3427,3479
