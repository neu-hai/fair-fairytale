1,"They had three children, and my story happened while the youngest was a baby. ",68,146
2,"The wife was a good wife enough, but her mind was all on her family and her farm, and she hardly ever went to her knees without falling asleep, and she thought the time spent in the chapel was twice as long as it need be. ",146,368
3,"So, friends, she let her man and her two children go before her one day to Mass, while she called to consult a fairy man about a disorder one of her cows had. ",368,527
4,"She was late at the chapel, and was sorry all the day after, for her husband was in grief about it, and she was very fond of him. ",527,657
5,Late that night he was wakened up by the cries of his children calling out 'Mother! ,657,741
6,Mother!' ,741,750
7,"When he sat up and rubbed his eyes, there was no wife by his side, and when he asked the little ones what was become of their mother, they said they saw the room full of nice little men and women, dressed in white and red and green, and their mother in the middle of them, going out by the door as if she was walking in her sleep. ",750,1081
8,"Out he ran, and searched everywhere round the house but, neither tale nor tidings did he get of her for many a day. ",1081,1197
9,"Well, the poor man was miserable enough, for he was as fond of his woman as she was of him. ",1197,1289
10,"It used to bring the salt tears down his cheeks to see his poor children neglected and dirty, as they often were, and they'd be bad enough only for a kind neighbour that used to look in whenever she could spare time. ",1289,1506
11,The infant was away with a nurse. ,1506,1540
12,"About six weeks after--just as he was going out to his work one morning--a neighbour, that used to mind women when they were ill, came up to him, and kept step by step with him to the field, and this is what she told him. ",1540,1762
13,"Just as I was falling asleep last night, I heard a horse's tramp on the grass and a knock at the door, and there, when I came out, was a fine-looking dark man, mounted on a black horse, and he told me to get ready in all haste, for a lady was in great want of me. ",1762,2026
14,"As soon as I put on my cloak and things, he took me by the hand, and I was sitting behind him before I felt myself stirring. ",2026,2151
15,"""Where are we going, sir?"" ",2151,2178
16,says I. ,2178,2186
17,"""You'll soon know,"" says he; ",2186,2215
18," and he drew his fingers across my eyes, and not a ray could I see. ",2214,2282
19,"I kept a tight grip of him, and I little knew whether he was going backwards or forwards, or how long we were about it, till my hand was taken again, and I felt the ground under me. ",2282,2464
20,"The fingers went the other way across my eyes, and there we were before a castle door, and in we went through a big hall and great rooms all painted in fine green colours, with red and gold bands and ornaments, and the finest carpets and chairs and tables and window curtains, and grand ladies and gentlemen walking about. ",2464,2787
21,"At last we came to a bedroom, with a beautiful lady in bed, with a fine bouncing boy beside her. ",2787,2884
22,"The lady clapped her hands, and in came the Dark Man and kissed her and the baby, and praised me, and gave me a bottle of green ointment to rub the child all over. ",2884,3048
23,"Well, the child I rubbed, sure enough; ",3048,3087
24," but my right eye began to smart, and I put up my finger and gave it a rub, and then stared, for never in all my life was I so frightened. ",3086,3225
25,"The beautiful room was a big, rough cave, with water oozing over the edges of the stones and through the clay; ",3225,3336
26," and the lady, and the lord, and the child weazened, poverty-bitten creatures--nothing but skin and bone--and the rich dresses were old rags. ",3335,3477
27,"I didn't let on that I found any difference, and after a bit says the Dark Man, ""Go before me to the hall door, and I will be with you in a few moments, and see you safe home."" ",3477,3654
28,"Well, just as I turned into the outside cave, who should I see watching near the door but poor Molly. ",3654,3756
29,"She looked round all terrified, and says she to me in a whisper, ""I'm brought here to nurse the child of the king and queen of the fairies; ",3756,3896

34,Don't open your mouth to answer. ,4173,4206
35,"I saw what happened with the ointment."" ",4206,4246
36,"The Dark Man didn't once cast his eye towards Molly, and he seemed to have no suspicion of me. ",4246,4341
37,"When we came out I looked about me, and where do you think we were but in the dyke of the Rath of Cromogue. ",4341,4449
38,"I was on the horse again, which was nothing but a big rag-weed, and I was in dread every minute I'd fall off; ",4449,4559
39, but nothing happened till I found myself in my own cabin. ,4558,4617
40,"The king slipped five guineas into my hand as soon as I was on the ground, and thanked me, and bade me good night. ",4617,4732
41,I hope I'll never see his face again. ,4732,4770
42,"I got into bed, and couldn't sleep for a long time; ",4770,4822
43," and when I examined my five guineas this morning, that I left in the table drawer the last thing, I found five withered leaves of oak--bad luck to the giver! ",4821,4980
44,"Well, you may all think the fright, and the joy, and the grief the poor man was in when the woman finished her story. ",4980,5098
45,"They talked and they talked, but we needn't mind what they said till Friday night came, when both were standing where the mountain road crosses the one going to Ross. ",5098,5265
46,"There they stood, looking towards the bridge of Thuar, in the dead of the night, with a little moonlight shining from over Kilachdiarmid. ",5265,5403
47,"At last she gave a start, and ""By this and by that,"" says she, ""here they come, bridles jingling and feathers tossing!"" ",5403,5523
48,"He looked, but could see nothing; ",5523,5557
49," and she stood trembling and her eyes wide open, looking down the way to the ford of Ballinacoola. ",5556,5655
50,"""I see your wife,"" says she, ""riding on the outside just so as to rub against us. ",5655,5737
51,"We'll walk on quietly, as if we suspected nothing, and when we are passing I'll give you a shove. ",5737,5835
52,"If you don't do YOUR duty then, woe be with you!"" ",5835,5885
53,"Well, they walked on easy, and the poor hearts beating in both their breasts; ",5885,5963
54," and though he could see nothing, he heard a faint jingle and trampling and rustling, and at last he got the push that she promised. ",5962,6095
55,"He spread out his arms, and there was his wife's waist within them, and he could see her plain; ",6095,6191
56," but such a hullabulloo rose as if there was an earthquake, and he found himself surrounded by horrible-looking things, roaring at him and striving to pull his wife away. ",6190,6361
57,"But he made the sign of the cross and bid them begone in God's name, and held his wife as if it was iron his arms were made of. ",6361,6489
58,"Bedad, in one moment everything was as silent as the grave, and the poor woman lying in a faint in the arms of her husband and her good neighbour. ",6489,6636
59,"Well, all in good time she was minding her family and her business again; ",6636,6710
60," and I'll go bail, after the fright she got, she spent more time on her knees, and avoided fairy men all the days of the week, and particularly on Sunday. ",6709,6864

64,"'Oh, sir,' says she, very foolish, 'I hope your lady is well, and the baby.' ",7203,7280
65,"'Pretty well, thank you,' says he, rather frightened like. ",7280,7339
66,'How do I look in this new suit?' ,7339,7373
67,"says he, getting to one side of her. ",7373,7410
68,"'I can't see you plain at all, sir,' says she. ",7410,7457
69,"'Well, now?' ",7457,7470
70,"says he, getting round her back to the other side. ",7470,7521
71,"'Musha, indeed, sir, your coat looks no better than a withered dock-leaf.' ",7521,7596
72,"'Maybe, then,' says he, 'it will be different now,' and he struck the eye next him with a switch. ",7596,7694
73,"Friends, she never saw a glimmer after with that one till the day of her death.",7694,7774
