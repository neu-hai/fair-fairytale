0,"There was once a woman who wanted to have quite a tiny, little child, but she did not know where to get one from. ",0,114
1,"So one day she went to an old Witch and said to her: 'I should so much like to have a tiny, little child; ",114,220
2, can you tell me where I can get one?' ,219,258
3,"'Oh, we have just got one ready!'",258,291
4,'said the Witch. ,290,307
5,"'Here is a barley-corn for you, but it's not the kind the farmer sows in his field, or feeds the cocks and hens with, I can tell you. ",307,441
6,"Put it in a flower-pot, and then you will see something happen.' ",441,506
7,"'Oh, thank you!'",506,522
8,"'said the woman, and gave the Witch a shilling, for that was what it cost. ",521,596
9,Then she went home and planted the barley-corn; ,596,644
10," immediately there grew out of it a large and beautiful flower, which looked like a tulip, but the petals were tightly closed as if it were still only a bud. ",643,801
11,'What a beautiful flower!',801,827
12,"'exclaimed the woman, and she kissed the red and yellow petals; ",826,890
13, but as she kissed them the flower burst open. ,889,936
14,"It was a real tulip, such as one can see any day; ",936,986
15," but in the middle of the blossom, on the green velvety petals, sat a little girl, quite tiny, trim, and pretty. ",985,1098
16,She was scarcely half a thumb in height; ,1098,1139
17, so they called her Thumbelina. ,1138,1170
18,"An elegant polished walnut-shell served Thumbelina as a cradle, the blue petals of a violet were her mattress, and a rose-leaf her coverlid. ",1170,1311
19,"There she lay at night, but in the day-time she used to play about on the table; ",1311,1392
20," here the woman had put a bowl, surrounded by a ring of flowers, with their stalks in water, in the middle of which floated a great tulip pedal, and on this Thumbelina sat, and sailed from one side of the bowl to the other, rowing herself with two white horse-hairs for oars. ",1391,1667
21,It was such a pretty sight! ,1667,1695
22,"She could sing, too, with a voice more soft and sweet than had ever been heard before. ",1695,1782
23,"One night, when she was lying in her pretty little bed, an old toad crept in through a broken pane in the window. ",1782,1896
24,"She was very ugly, clumsy, and clammy; ",1896,1935
25, she hopped on to the table where Thumbelina lay asleep under the red rose-leaf. ,1934,2015
26,"'This would make a beautiful wife for my son,'said the toad, taking up the walnut-shell, with Thumbelina inside, and hopping with it through the window into the garden. ",2015,2184
27,"There flowed a great wide stream, with slippery and marshy banks; ",2184,2250
28, here the toad lived with her son. ,2249,2284
29,Ugh! ,2284,2289
30,"how ugly and clammy he was, just like his mother! ",2289,2339
31,"'Croak, croak, croak!'",2339,2361
32,'was all he could say when he saw the pretty little girl in the walnut-shell. ,2360,2438
33,"'Don't talk so load, or you'll wake her,'said the old toad. ",2438,2498
34,'She might escape us even now; ,2498,2529
35, she is as light as a feather. ,2528,2559
36,We will put her at once on a broad water-lily leaf in the stream. ,2559,2625
37,That will be quite an island for her; ,2625,2663
38, she is so small and light. ,2662,2690
39,"She can't run away from us there, whilst we are preparing the guest-chamber under the marsh where she shall live.' ",2690,2805
40,"Outside in the brook grew many water-lilies, with broad green leaves, which looked as if they were swimming about on the water. ",2805,2933
41,"The leaf farthest away was the largest, and to this the old toad swam with Thumbelina in her walnut-shell. ",2933,3040
42,"The tiny Thumbelina woke up very early in the morning, and when she saw where she was she began to cry bitterly; ",3040,3153
43," for on every side of the great green leaf was water, and she could not get to the land. ",3152,3241
44,"The old toad was down under the marsh, decorating her room with rushes and yellow marigold leaves, to make it very grand for her new daughter-in-law; ",3241,3391
45, then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf where Thumbelina lay. ,3390,3461
46,She wanted to fetch the pretty cradle to put it into her room before Thumbelina herself came there. ,3461,3561
47,"The old toad bowed low in the water before her, and said: 'Here is my son; ",3561,3636
48," you shall marry him, and live in great magnificence down under the marsh.' ",3635,3711
49,"'Croak, croak, croak!'",2339,2361
50,'was all that the son could say. ,3732,3765
51,Then they took the neat little cradle and swam away with it; ,3765,3826
52," but Thumbelina sat alone on the great green leaf and wept, for she did not want to live with the clammy toad, or marry her ugly son. ",3825,3959
53,"The little fishes swimming about under the water had seen the toad quite plainly, and heard what she had said; ",3959,4070
54, so they put up their heads to see the little girl. ,4069,4121
55,"When they saw her, they thought her so pretty that they were very sorry she should go down with the ugly toad to live. ",4121,4240
56,No; ,4240,4244
57, that must not happen. ,4243,4266
58,"They assembled in the water round the green stalk which supported the leaf on which she was sitting, and nibbled the stem in two. ",4266,4396
59,"Away floated the leaf down the stream, bearing Thumbelina far beyond the reach of the toad. ",4396,4488
60,"On she sailed past several towns, and the little birds sitting in the bushes saw her, and sang, 'What a pretty little girl!'",4488,4612
61,'The leaf floated farther and farther away; ,4611,4655
62, thus Thumbelina left her native land. ,4654,4693
63,"A beautiful little white butterfly fluttered above her, and at last settled on the leaf. ",4693,4782
64,"Thumbelina pleased him, and she, too, was delighted, for now the toads could not reach her, and it was so beautiful where she was travelling; ",4782,4924
65, the sun shone on the water and made it sparkle like the brightest silver. ,4923,4998
66,"She took off her sash, and tied one end round the butterfly; ",4998,5059
67," the other end she fastened to the leaf, so that now it glided along with her faster than ever. ",5058,5154
68,A great cockchafer came flying past; ,5154,5191
69," he caught sight of Thumbelina, and in a moment had put his arms round her slender waist, and had flown off with her to a tree. ",5190,5318
70,"The green leaf floated away down the stream, and the butterfly with it, for he was fastened to the leaf and could not get loose from it. ",5318,5455
71,"Oh, dear! ",5455,5465
72,how terrified poor little Thumbelina was when the cockchafer flew off with her to the tree! ,5465,5557
73,"But she was especially distressed on the beautiful white butterfly's account, as she had tied him fast, so that if he could not get away he must starve to death. ",5557,5719
74,But the cockchafer did not trouble himself about that; ,5719,5774
75," he sat down with her on a large green leaf, gave her the honey out of the flowers to eat, and told her that she was very pretty, although she wasn't in the least like a cockchafer. ",5773,5955
76,"Later on, all the other cockchafers who lived in the same tree came to pay calls; ",5955,6037
77," they examined Thumbelina closely, and remarked, 'Why, she has only two legs! ",6036,6114
78,How very miserable!' ,6114,6135
79,'She has no feelers!',6135,6156
80,'cried another. ,6155,6171
81,'How ugly she is!',6171,6189
82,'said all the lady chafers-and yet Thumbelina was really very pretty. ,6188,6258
83,The cockchafer who had stolen her knew this very well; ,6258,6313
84," but when he heard all the ladies saying she was ugly, he began to think so too, and would not keep her; ",6312,6417
85, she might go wherever she liked. ,6416,6450
86,So he flew down from the tree with her and put her on a daisy. ,6450,6513
87,"There she sat and wept, because she was so ugly that the cockchafer would have nothing to do with her; ",6513,6616
88," and yet she was the most beautiful creature imaginable, so soft and delicate, like the loveliest rose-leaf. ",6615,6724
89,The whole summer poor little Thumbelina lived alone in the great wood. ,6724,6795
90,"She plaited a bed for herself of blades of grass, and hung it up under a clover-leaf, so that she was protected from the rain; ",6795,6922
91," she gathered honey from the flowers for food, and drank the dew on the leaves every morning. ",6921,7015
92,"Thus the summer and autumn passed, but then came winter-the long, cold winter. ",7015,7094
93,All the birds who had sung so sweetly about her had flown away; ,7094,7158
94," the trees shed their leaves, the flowers died; ",7157,7205
95," the great clover-leaf under which she had lived curled up, and nothing remained of it but the withered stalk. ",7204,7315
96,"She was terribly cold, for her clothes were ragged, and she herself was so small and thin. ",7315,7406
97,Poor little Thumbelina! ,7406,7430
98,she would surely be frozen to death. ,7430,7467
99,"It began to snow, and every snow-flake that fell on her was to her as a whole shovelful thrown on one of us, for we are so big, and she was only an inch high. ",7467,7626
100,"She wrapt herself round in a dead leaf, but it was torn in the middle and gave her no warmth; ",7626,7720
101, she was trembling with cold. ,7719,7749
102,Just outside the wood where she was now living lay a great corn-field. ,7749,7820
103,But the corn had been gone a long time; ,7820,7860
104," only the dry, bare stubble was left standing in the frozen ground. ",7859,7927
105,This made a forest for her to wander about in. ,7927,7974
106,"All at once she came across the door of a field-mouse, who had a little hole under a corn-stalk. ",7974,8071
107,"There the mouse lived warm and snug, with a store-room full of corn, a splendid kitchen and dining-room. ",8071,8176
108,"Poor little Thumbelina went up to the door and begged for a little piece of barley, for she had not had anything to eat for the last two days. ",8176,8319
109,'Poor little creature!',8319,8342
110,"'said the field-mouse, for she was a kind-hearted old thing at the bottom. ",8341,8416
111,'Come into my warm room and have some dinner with me.' ,8416,8471
112,"As Thumbelina pleased her, she said: 'As far as I am concerned you may spend the winter with me; ",8471,8568
113," but you must keep my room clean and tidy, and tell me stories, for I like that very much.' ",8567,8659
114,"And Thumbelina did all that the kind old field-mouse asked, and did it remarkably well too. ",8659,8751
115,"'Now I am expecting a visitor,'said the field-mouse; ",8751,8804
116, 'my neighbour comes to call on me once a week. ,8803,8851
117,"He is in better circumstances than I am, has great, big rooms, and wears a fine black-velvet coat. ",8851,8950
118,"If you could only marry him, you would be well provided for. ",8950,9011
119,But he is blind. ,9011,9028
120,You must tell him all the prettiest stories you know.' ,9028,9083
121,"But Thumbelina did not trouble her head about him, for he was only a mole. ",9083,9158
122,He came and paid them a visit in his black-velvet coat. ,9158,9214
123,"'He is so rich and so accomplished,'the field-mouse told her. ",9214,9276
124,'His house is twenty times larger than mine; ,9276,9321
125," he possesses great knowledge, but he cannot bear the sun and the beautiful flowers, and speaks slightingly of them, for he has never seen them.' ",9320,9466
126,"Thumbelina had to sing to him, so she sang 'Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home!'",9466,9547
127,'and other songs so prettily that the mole fell in love with her; ,9546,9612
128," but he did not say anything, he was a very cautious man. ",9611,9669
129,A short time before he had dug a long passage through the ground from his own house to that of his neighbour; ,9669,9779
130, in this he gave the field-mouse and Thumbelina permission to walk as often as they liked. ,9778,9869
131,"But he begged them not to be afraid of the dead bird that lay in the passage: it was a real bird with beak and feathers, and must have died a little time ago, and now laid buried just where he had made his tunnel. ",9869,10083
132,"The mole took a piece of rotten wood in his mouth, for that glows like fire in the dark, and went in front, lighting them through the long dark passage. ",10083,10236
133,"When they came to the place where the dead bird lay, the mole put his broad nose against the ceiling and pushed a hole through, so that the daylight could shine down. ",10236,10403
134,"In the middle of the path lay a dead swallow, his pretty wings pressed close to his sides, his claws and head drawn under his feathers; ",10403,10539
135, the poor bird had evidently died of cold. ,10538,10581
136,"Thumbelina was very sorry, for she was very fond of all little birds; ",10581,10651
137, they had sung and twittered so beautifully to her all through the summer. ,10650,10725
138,But the mole kicked him with his bandy legs and said: 'Now he can't sing any more! ,10725,10808
139,It must be very miserable to be a little bird! ,10808,10855
140,I'm thankful that none of my little children are; ,10855,10905
141, birds always starve in winter.' ,10904,10937
142,"'Yes, you speak like a sensible man,'said the field-mouse. ",10937,10996
143,"'What has a bird, in spite of all his singing, in the winter-time? ",10996,11063
144,"He must starve and freeze, and that must be very pleasant for him, I must say!' ",11063,11143
145,Thumbelina did not say anything; ,11143,11176
146," but when the other two had passed on she bent down to the bird, brushed aside the feathers from his head, and kissed his closed eyes gently. ",11175,11317
147,"'Perhaps it was he that sang to me so prettily in the summer,'she thought. ",11317,11392
148,"'How much pleasure he did give me, dear little bird!' ",11392,11446
149,"The mole closed up the hole again which let in the light, and then escorted the ladies home. ",11446,11539
150,But Thumbelina could not sleep that night; ,11539,11582
151," so she got out of bed, and plaited a great big blanket of straw, and carried it off, and spread it over the dead bird, and piled upon it thistle-down as soft as cotton-wool, which she had found in the field-mouse's room, so that the poor little thing should lie warmly buried. ",11581,11859
152,"'Farewell, pretty little bird!'",11859,11890
153,'she said. ,11889,11900
154,"'Farewell, and thank you for your beautiful songs in the summer, when the trees were green, and the sun shone down warmly on us!'",11900,12029
155,'Then she laid her head against the bird's heart. ,12028,12078
156,"But the bird was not dead: he had been frozen, but now that she had warmed him, he was coming to life again. ",12078,12187
157,In autumn the swallows fly away to foreign lands; ,12187,12237
158," but there are some who are late in starting, and then they get so cold that they drop down as if dead, and the snow comes and covers them over. ",12236,12381
159,"Thumbelina trembled, she was so frightened; ",12381,12425
160, for the bird was very large in comparison with herself-only an inch high. ,12424,12499
161,"But she took courage, piled up the down more closely over the poor swallow, fetched her own coverlid and laid it over his head. ",12499,12627
162,Next night she crept out again to him. ,12627,12666
163,"There he was alive, but very weak; ",12666,12701
164," he could only open his eyes for a moment and look at Thumbelina, who was standing in front of him with a piece of rotten wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern. ",12700,12870
165,"'Thank you, pretty little child!'",12870,12903
166,'said the swallow to her. ,12902,12928
167,'I am so beautifully warm! ,12928,12955
168,"Soon I shall regain my strength, and then I shall be able to fly out again into the warm sunshine.' ",12955,13055
169,'Oh!',13055,13060
170,"'she said, 'it is very cold outside; ",13059,13096
171, it is snowing and freezing! ,13095,13124
172,stay in your warm bed; ,13124,13147
173, I will take care of you!' ,13146,13173
174,"Then she brought him water in a petal, which he drank, after which he related to her how he had torn one of his wings on a bramble, so that he could not fly as fast as the other swallows, who had flown far away to warmer lands. ",13173,13401
175,"So at last he had dropped down exhausted, and then he could remember no more. ",13401,13479
176,"The whole winter he remained down there, and Thumbelina looked after him and nursed him tenderly. ",13479,13577
177,"Neither the mole nor the field-mouse learnt anything of this, for they could not bear the poor swallow. ",13577,13681
178,"When the spring came, and the sun warmed the earth again, the swallow said farewell to Thumbelina, who opened the hole in the roof for him which the mole had made. ",13681,13845
179,"The sun shone brightly down upon her, and the swallow asked her if she would go with him; ",13845,13935
180, she could sit upon his back. ,13934,13964
181,"Thumbelina wanted very much to fly far away into the green wood, but she knew that the old field-mouse would be sad if she ran away. ",13964,14097
182,"'No, I mustn't come!'",14097,14118
183,'she said. ,11889,11900
184,"'Farewell, dear good little girl!'",14128,14162
185,"'said the swallow, and flew off into the sunshine. ",14161,14212
186,"Thumbelina gazed after him with the tears standing in her eyes, for she was very fond of the swallow. ",14212,14314
187,"'Tweet, tweet!' ",14314,14330
188,"sang the bird, and flew into the green wood. ",14330,14375
189,Thumbelina was very unhappy. ,14375,14404
190,She was not allowed to go out into the warm sunshine. ,14404,14458
191,"The corn which had been sowed in the field over the field-mouse's home grew up high into the air, and made a thick forest for the poor little girl, who was only an inch high. ",14458,14633
192,"'Now you are to be a bride, Thumbelina!'",14633,14673
193,"'said the field-mouse, 'for our neighbour has proposed for you! ",14672,14736
194,What a piece of fortune for a poor child like you! ,14736,14787
195,"Now you must set to work at your linen for your dowry, for nothing must be lacking if you are to become the wife of our neighbour, the mole!' ",14787,14929
196,"Thumbelina had to spin all day long, and every evening the mole visited her, and told her that when the summer was over the sun would not shine so hot; ",14929,15081
197, now it was burning the earth as hard as a stone. ,15080,15130
198,"Yes, when the summer had passed, they would keep the wedding. ",15130,15192
199,"But she was not at all pleased about it, for she did not like the stupid mole. ",15192,15271
200,"Every morning when the sun was rising, and every evening when it was setting, she would steal out of the house-door, and when the breeze parted the ears of corn so that she could see the blue sky through them, she thought how bright and beautiful it must be outside, and longed to see her dear swallow again. ",15271,15580
201,But he never came; ,15580,15599
202, no doubt he had flown away far into the great green wood. ,15598,15657
203,By the autumn Thumbelina had finished the dowry. ,15657,15706
204,'In four weeks you will be married!',15706,15742
205,'said the field-mouse; ,8781,8804
206," 'don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my sharp white teeth! ",15763,15832
207,You will get a fine husband! ,15832,15861
208,The King himself has not such a velvet coat. ,15861,15906
209,"His store-room and cellar are full, and you should be thankful for that.' ",15906,15980
210,"Well, the wedding-day arrived. ",15980,16011
211,"The mole had come to fetch Thumbelina to live with him deep down under the ground, never to come out into the warm sun again, for that was what he didn't like. ",16011,16171
212,The poor little girl was very sad; ,16171,16206
213, for now she must say good-bye to the beautiful sun. ,16205,16258
214,"'Farewell, bright sun!'",16258,16281
215,"'she cried, stretching out her arms towards it, and taking another step outside the house; ",16280,16371
216," for now the corn had been reaped, and only the dry stubble was left standing. ",16370,16449
217,"'Farewell, farewell!'",16449,16470
218,"'she said, and put her arms round a little red flower that grew there. ",16469,16540
219,'Give my love to the dear swallow when you see him!' ,16540,16593
220,"'Tweet, tweet!' ",14314,14330
221,sounded in her ear all at once. ,16609,16641
222,She looked up. ,16641,16656
223,There was the swallow flying past! ,16656,16691
224,"As soon as he saw Thumbelina, he was very glad. ",16691,16739
225,"She told him how unwilling she was to marry the ugly mole, as then she had to live underground where the sun never shone, and she could not help bursting into tears. ",16739,16905
226,"'The cold winter is coming now,' said the swallow. ",16905,16956
227,'I must fly away to warmer lands: will you come with me? ,16956,17013
228,"You can sit on my back, and we will fly far away from the ugly mole and his dark house, over the mountains, to the warm countries where the sun shines more brightly than here, where it is always summer, and there are always beautiful flowers. ",17013,17256
229,"Do come with me, dear little Thumbelina, who saved my life when I lay frozen in the dark tunnel!' ",17256,17354
230,"'Yes, I will go with you,' said Thumbelina, and got on the swallow's back, with her feet on one of his outstretched wings. ",17354,17477
231,"Up he flew into the air, over woods and seas, over the great mountains where the snow is always lying. ",17477,17580
232,"And if she was cold she crept under his warm feathers, only keeping her little head out to admire all the beautiful things in the world beneath. ",17580,17725
233,At last they came to warm lands; ,17725,17758
234," there the sun was brighter, the sky seemed twice as high, and in the hedges hung the finest green and purple grapes; ",17757,17875
235," in the woods grew oranges and lemons: the air was scented with myrtle and mint, and on the roads were pretty little children running about and playing with great gorgeous butterflies. ",17874,18059
236,"But the swallow flew on farther, and it became more and more beautiful. ",18059,18131
237,Under the most splendid green trees besides a blue lake stood a glittering white-marble castle. ,18131,18227
238,Vines hung about the high pillars; ,18227,18262
239," there were many swallows'nests, and in one of these lived the swallow who was carrying Thumbelina. ",18261,18361
240,'Here is my house!' ,18361,18381
241,said he. ,18381,18390
242,'But it won't do for you to live with me; ,18390,18432
243, I am not tidy enough to please you. ,18431,18468
244,Find a home for yourself in one of the lovely flowers that grow down there; ,18468,18544
245," now I will set you down, and you can do whatever you like.' ",18543,18604
246,'That will be splendid!' ,18604,18629
247,"said she, clapping her little hands. ",18629,18666
248,"There lay a great white marble column which had fallen to the ground and broken into three pieces, but between these grew the most beautiful white flowers. ",18666,18822
249,"The swallow flew down with Thumbelina, and set her upon one of the broad leaves. ",18822,18903
250,"But there, to her astonishment, she found a tiny little man sitting in the middle of the flower, as white and transparent as if he were made of glass; ",18903,19054
251," he had the prettiest golden crown on his head, and the most beautiful wings on his shoulders; ",19053,19148
252, he himself was no bigger than Thumbelina. ,19147,19190
253,He was the spirit of the flower. ,19190,19223
254,In each blossom there dwelt a tiny man or woman; ,19223,19272
255, but this one was the King over the others. ,19271,19315
256,'How handsome he is!' ,19315,19337
257,whispered Thumbelina to the swallow. ,19337,19374
258,"The little Prince was very much frightened at the swallow, for in comparison with one so tiny as himself he seemed a giant. ",19374,19498
259,"But when he saw Thumbelina, he was delighted, for she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. ",19498,19598
260,"So he took his golden crown from off his head and put it on hers, asking her her name, and if she would be his wife, and then she would be Queen of all the flowers. ",19598,19763
261,Yes! ,19763,19768
262,he was a different kind of husband to the son of the toad and the mole with the black-velvet coat. ,19768,19867
263,"So she said ""Yes"" to the noble Prince. ",19867,19906
264,"And out of each flower came a lady and gentleman, each so tiny and pretty that it was a pleasure to see them. ",19906,20016
265,"Each brought Thumbelina a present, but the best of all was a beautiful pair of wings which were fastened on to her back, and now she too could fly from flower to flower. ",20016,20186
266,"They all wished her joy, and the swallow sat above in his nest and sang the wedding march, and that he did as well as he could; ",20186,20314
267," but he was sad, because he was very fond of Thumbelina and did not want to be separated from her. ",20313,20412
268,'You shall not be called Thumbelina!' ,20412,20450
269,said the spirit of the flower to her; ,20450,20488
270," 'that is an ugly name, and you are much too pretty for that. ",20487,20549
271,We will call you May Blossom.' ,20549,20580
272,"'Farewell, farewell!'s",16449,16471
273,"said the little swallow with a heavy heart, and flew away to farther lands, far, far away, right back to Denmark. ",20602,20716
274,"There he had a little nest above a window, where his wife lived, who can tell fairy-stories. ",20716,20809
275,"'Tweet, tweet!' ",14314,14330
276,he sang to her. ,20825,20841
277,And that is the way we learnt the whole story.,20841,20888
