0,"Once upon a time there was a king who had a three-year old son, and was obliged to go to war against another king. ",0,115
1,"Then, when his ships sailed home again after he had gained a splendid victory, a storm broke out and his whole fleet was near sinking. ",115,250
2,But the king vowed he would sacrifice to the sea-queen the first male creature that came to meet him when he reached land and entered his capital. ,250,397
3,Thereby the whole fleet reached the harbor in safety. ,397,451
4,"But the five-year old prince, who had not seen his father for the past two years, and who was delighted with the thunder of the cannon as the ships came in, secretly slipped away from his attendants, and ran to the landing. ",451,675
5,"When the king came ashore he was the first to cast himself into his arms, weeping with joy. ",675,767
6,The king was frightened when he thought of the sea-queen. ,767,825
7,"He thought that, after all, the prince was only a child, and at any rate he could sacrifice the next person to step up to him after the prince. ",825,969
8,But from that time on no one could make a successful sea-trip. ,969,1032
9,The people began to murmur because the king had not kept the promise he had made the sea-queen. ,1032,1128
10,"But the king and queen never allowed the prince out without a great escort, and he was never permitted to enter a ship, for all his desire to do so. ",1128,1277
11,"After a few years they gradually forgot the sea-queen, and when the prince was ten years old, a little brother came to join him. ",1277,1406
12,Not long after the older of the princes was out walking with his tutor and several other gentlemen. ,1406,1506
13,"And when they reached the end of the royal gardens by the sea-shore-it was a summer's day, unusually clear-they were suddenly enveloped by a thick cloud, which disappeared as swiftly as it had come. ",1506,1705
14,"And when it vanished, the prince was no longer there. ",1705,1759
15,"Nor did he return, to the great sorrow of the king, the queen and the whole country. ",1759,1844
16,In the meantime the young prince who was now the sole heir to the crown and kingdom grew up. ,1844,1937
17,"When he was sixteen, they began to think of finding a wife for him. ",1937,2005
18,"For the old king and queen wished to see him marry the daughter of some powerful monarch to whom they were allied, before they died. ",2005,2138
19,"With this in view, letters were written and embassies sent out to the most distant countries. ",2138,2232
20,"While these negotiations were being conducted, it began to be said that the sea-shore was haunted. ",2232,2331
21,"Various people had heard cries, and several who had walked by the sea-shore late in the evening had fallen ill. At length no one ventured to go there. ",2331,2482
22,"After eleven at night, because a voice kept crying from out at sea: ""First born, first wed!"" ",2482,2575
23,And when some one did venture nearer he did so at the risk of his life. ,2575,2647
24,At last these complaints came to the king's ear. ,2647,2696
25,"He called together his council, and it was decided to question a wise woman, who had already foretold many mysterious happenings, which had all taken place exactly as she had said they would. ",2696,2888
26,"When the wise woman was brought before the king she said it was the prince who had been taken into the sea who was calling, and that they would have to find him a bride, young, beautiful, and belonging to one of the noblest families of the land, and she must be no less than fifteen and no more than seventeen years old. ",2888,3209
27,That seemed a serious difficulty; ,3209,3243
28, for no one wished to give their daughter to a sea-king. ,3242,3299
29,"Yet, when there was no end to the cries and the commotion, the wise woman said, that first it might be well to build a little house by the sea, perhaps then the turmoil might die away. ",3299,3484
30,"At any rate, she said, no phantoms would haunt the place while the building was in progress. ",3484,3577
31,"Hence no more than four workmen need be employed, and they might first prepare a site, then lay the stone foundation, and finally erect the small house, comprising no more than two pleasant, handsome rooms, one behind the other, and a good floor. ",3577,3824
32,"The house was carefully erected, and the royal architect himself had to superintend the work, so that everything might be done as well as possible. ",3824,3972
33,"And while the building was going on, there were no mysterious noises, and every one could travel peacefully along the sea-shore. ",3972,4101
34,For that reason the four workmen did not hurry with their work; ,4101,4165
35," yet not one of them could stay away for a day, because when they did the tumult along the shore would begin again, and one could hear the cries: ""First born, first wed!"" ",4164,4335
36,"When the little house was finally completed, the best carpenters came and worked in it, then painters and other craftsmen, and at last it was furnished, because when the work stopped for no more than a single day the cries were heard again by night. ",4335,4585
37,"The rooms were fitted out as sumptuously as possible, and a great mirror was hung in the drawing-room. ",4585,4688
38,"According to the instructions of the wise woman, it was hung in such wise that from the bed in the bed-room, even though one's face were turned to the wall, one could still see who stepped over the threshold into the drawing-room; ",4688,4919
39, for the door between each room was always to stand open. ,4918,4976
40,"When all was finished, and the little house had been arranged with regal splendor, the cries of ""First born, first wed!"" ",4976,5097
41,again began to sound from the shore. ,5097,5134
42,"And it was found necessary, though all were unwilling, to follow the wise woman's counsel, and choose three of the loveliest maidens between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, belonging to the first families of the land. ",5134,5355
43,"They were to be taken to the castle, said the wise woman, and to be treated like ladies of the blood royal, and one after another they were to be sent to the little house by the sea-shore; ",5355,5544
44," for should one of them find favor in the eyes of the sea-prince, then the commotion and turmoil would surely cease. ",5543,5660
45,"In the meantime the negotiations for the marriage of the younger prince were continued, and the bride selected for him was soon expected to arrive. ",5660,5808
46,So the girls were also chosen for the sea-prince. ,5808,5858
47,"The three chosen, as well as their parents, were quite inconsolable over their fate; ",5858,5943
48, even the fact that they were to be treated like princesses did not console them; ,5942,6024
49, yet had they not yielded it would have been all the worse for them and for the whole land. ,6023,6115
50,"The first girl destined to sleep in the sea-palace was the oldest, and when she sought out the wise woman, and asked her advice, the latter said she should lie down in the handsome bed; ",6115,6301
51," but should turn her face to the wall, and under no circumstances turn around curiously, and try and see what was going on. ",6300,6424
52,She had only the right to behold what she saw reflected in the mirror in the drawing-room as she lay with her face to the wall. ,6424,6552
53,At ten o'clock that night the royal sea-bride was led with great pomp to the little house. ,6552,6643
54,"Her relatives and the court said farewell to her with many tears, left her before eleven, locked the door on the outside, and took the keys with them to the castle. ",6643,6808
55,"The wise woman was also there, consoled the people, and assured them that if the maiden only forbore to speak, and did not turn around, she would come out in the morning fresh and blooming. ",6808,6998
56,The poor girl prayed and wept until she grew sleepy; ,6998,7051
57," but toward twelve o'clock the outer door suddenly opened, and then the door of the drawing-room. ",7050,7148
58,"She was startled and filled with fear when, her face turned toward the wall, she saw in the great mirror, how a tall, well-built youth entered, from whose garments the water ran in streams to the floor. ",7148,7351
59,"He shook himself as though freezing, and said ""Uh hu!"" ",7351,7406
60,"Then he went to the window, and there laid down an unusually large and handsome apple, and hung a bottle in the casement. ",7406,7528
61,"Next he stepped to the bed, bent over the sleeping girl and looked at her, strode up and down a few times, shaking the water from his clothes and saying ""Uh hu!"" ",7528,7690
62,"Then he went back to the bed, undressed hurriedly, lay down and fell asleep. ",7690,7767
63,"The poor girl, had not been sleeping; ",7767,7805
64, but had only closed her eyes when the prince bent over her. ,7804,7865
65,"Now she was glad to think he was fast asleep, and forgot the wise woman's warning not to turn around. ",7865,7967
66,"Her curiosity got the better of her, and she wanted to find out if this were a real human being. ",7967,8064
67,"She turned around softly, lest she wake him; ",8064,8109
68," but just as she sat up quietly in bed, in order to take a good look at her neighbor, he swiftly seized her right hand, hewed it off, and flung it under the bed. ",8108,8270
69,Then he at once lay down and fell asleep again. ,8270,8318
70,"As soon as it was day, he rose, dressed without casting even a glance at the bed, took the bottle and the apple from the window, went hastily out and locked the door after him. ",8318,8495
71,"One can imagine how the poor girl suffered in the meantime, and when her friends and relatives came to fetch her they found her weeping and robbed of her hand. ",8495,8655
72,"She was brought to the castle and the wise woman sent for, and overwhelmed with bitter reproaches. ",8655,8754
73,"But she said that if the maiden had not turned around, and had overcome her curiosity, she would not have lost her hand. ",8754,8875
74,They were to treat her as though she were really and truly a princess; ,8875,8946
75, but that it would be as much as her life were worth to allow her to return to the neighborhood of the little house. ,8945,9062
76,"The two girls were all the more discouraged by this mishap, and thought themselves condemned to death, though the wise woman consoled them as well as she knew how. ",9062,9226
77,The second promised her faithfully not to turn around; ,9226,9281
78, yet it happened with her as it had with the first. ,9280,9332
79,"The prince came in at twelve o'clock dripping, shook himself so that the water flew about, said ""Uh hu!"" ",9332,9437
80,"went to the window, laid down the beautiful apple, hung up the bottle, came into the bed-room, bent over the bed, strode up and down a few times, said ""Uh hu!"" ",9437,9597
81,"hastily undressed, and at once fell asleep. ",9597,9641
82,"Her curiosity gained the upper hand, and when she made sure that he was sleeping soundly, she carefully turned around in order to look at him. ",9641,9784
83,"But he seized her right hand, hewed it off and cast it under the bed, and then laid down again and slept on. ",9784,9893
84,"At dawn he rose, dressed without casting a glance at the bed, took the apple and the bottle, went out and locked the door after him. ",9893,10026
85,"When her friends and relatives came to fetch the girl in the morning, they found her weeping and without a right hand. ",10026,10145
86,"She was taken to the castle, where she found herself just as little welcome as her predecessor, and the wise woman insisted that the girl must have turned around, though at first she denied it absolutely. ",10145,10350
87,"Then the youngest, sweetest and loveliest of the three maidens had to go to the sea-castle amid the mourning of the entire court. ",10350,10480
88,"The wise woman accompanied her, and implored her not to turn around; ",10480,10549
89, since there was no other means of protection against the spell. ,10548,10613
90,"The maiden promised to heed her warning, and said that she would pray God to help her if she were plagued with curiosity. ",10613,10735
91,"All happened as before: the prince came on the stroke of twelve, dripping wet, said ""Uh hu!"" ",10735,10828
92,"shook himself, laid the apple on the window, hung up the bottle, went into the bed-room, bent over the bed, strode up and down for a few times, said ""Uh hu!"" ",10828,10986
93,"undressed, and at once fell asleep. ",9605,9641
94,"The poor girl was half-dead with fear and terror, and prayed and struggled against her curiosity till at length she fell asleep, and did not awake until the prince rose and dressed. ",11022,11204
95,"He stepped up to the bed, bent over it for a moment, went out, turned at the door and took the bottle and the apple, and then locked the door after him. ",11204,11357
96,"In the morning the entire court, the girl's parents and the wise woman came to fetch her. ",11357,11447
97,"She came to meet them weeping with joy, and was conducted to the castle in triumph and with joy indescribable. ",11447,11558
98,"The king and queen embraced her, and she was paid the same honors destined for the princess who was to arrive in the course of the next few days to marry the heir to the throne. ",11558,11736
99,"Now the maiden had to sleep every night in the little house by the strand, and every evening the prince came in with his apple and his bottle, and every morning went away at dawn. ",11736,11916
100,But it seemed to her that each succeeding evening and morning he looked at her a little longer; ,11916,12012
101," though she, always silent, timid, and turned toward the wall, did not dare see more than her mirror showed her of his coming and going. ",12011,12148
102,"But the two other girls, who had lost their hands, and who now no longer lived in the castle, were jealous of the honor shown the youngest, and threatened to have her done away with if she did not restore their hands. ",12148,12366
103,he maiden went weeping to the wise woman; ,12366,12408
104," and the latter said that when the prince had lain down as usual she should say-keeping her face turned toward the wall: ""The maidens twain will see me slain, Or else have back their hands again!"" ",12407,12604
105,But she was to offer no further information nor say another word. ,12604,12670
106,"With a beating heart the poor girl waited until the prince came, and when he had bent over the bed longer than usual, sighed, then hastily undressed and lain down, the maiden said, quivering and trembling: ""The maidens twain will see me slain, Or else have back their hands again!"" ",12670,12952
107,"The prince at once replied: ""Take the hands-they are lying under the bed-and the bottle hanging in the window, and pour some of the contents of the bottle on their arms and hands, join them together, bind them up, take away the bandages in three days' time and the hands will have been healed!"" ",12952,13247
108,The maiden made no reply and fell asleep. ,13247,13289
109,"In the morning the prince rose as usual, stepped over to the bed several times and looked at her from its foot; ",13289,13401
110," but she did not dare look up, and closed her eyes. ",13400,13452
111,"He sighed, took his apple; ",13452,13479
112," but left the bottle, and went. ",13478,13510
113,"When the maiden rose she did as he had told her, and in three days' time removed the bandages, and the girls' hands were well and whole. ",13510,13647
114,Now the foreign princess arrived and the wedding was to be celebrated as soon as possible. ,13647,13738
115,"Yet she was not fitted out with any more magnificence than the bride of the sea-prince, and both were equally honored by the king and court. ",13738,13879
116,"This annoyed the two other girls, and they again threatened to have the youngest done away with if she did not let them taste the apple which the prince always brought with him. ",13879,14057
117,"Again the maiden sought the advice of the wise woman, in whom she had confidence. ",14057,14139
118,"And that night, when the prince had lain down, she said: ""The maidens twain will see me slain, Or else your apple they would gain!"" ",14139,14271
119,"Then the prince said: ""Take the apple lying in the window, and when you go out, lay it on the ground and follow wherever it may roll. ",14271,14405
120,"And when it stops, pick as many apples as you wish, and return the same way you came."" ",14405,14492
121,"The maiden made no reply, and fell asleep. ",14492,14535
122,On the following morning it seemed harder than ever for the prince to resolve to go away. ,14535,14625
123,"He appeared excited and restless, sighed often, bent over the maiden several times, went into the living room, then turned around and looked at her once more. ",14625,14784
124,"Finally, when the sun rose, he hurried out and locked the door after him. ",14784,14858
125,"When the maiden rose, she could not help weeping, for she had really begun to love the prince. ",14858,14953
126,"Then she took the apple, and when she was outside the door, laid it on the ground, and it rolled and rolled, and she followed it, a long, long way, to a region unknown to her. ",14953,15129
127,"There she came to a high garden wall, over which hung the branches of trees, loaded with beautiful fruit. ",15129,15235
128,"Finally she reached a great portal, adorned with gold and splendid ornaments, which opened of its own accord as the apple rolled up to it. ",15235,15374
129,"And the apple rolled through the portal and the maiden followed it into the garden, which was the most beautiful she ever had seen. ",15374,15506
130,"The apple rolled over to a low-growing tree weighed with the most magnificent apples, and there it stopped. ",15506,15614
131,"The maiden picked all that her silken apron would hold, and turned to see from which direction she had come, and where the portal stood through which she would have to pass on her way back. ",15614,15804
132,"But the garden was so lovely that she felt like enjoying its charms a while longer, and without thinking of the prince's words, she touched the apple with her foot, and it began to roll again. ",15804,15997
133,Suddenly the portal closed with a great crash. ,15997,16044
134,"Then the maiden was much frightened, and regretted having done what had been forbidden her; ",16044,16136
135," yet now she could not get out, and was compelled to follow the apple once more. ",16135,16216
136,"It rolled far into the beautiful garden and stopped at a little fire-place, where stood two kettles of water, one small, the other large. ",16216,16354
137,There was a great fire burning under the large kettle; ,16354,16409
138, but only a weak fire beneath the smaller one. ,16408,16455
139,Now when the apple stopped there the maiden did not know what to do. ,16455,16524
140,Then it occurred to her to scrape away the fire beneath the large kettle and thrust it under the little one; ,16524,16633
141, and soon the kettle over the small fire began to boil and the kettle over the large one simmered down. ,16632,16736
142,But she could not stay there. ,16736,16766
143,"And since she had already disobeyed the order given her, she expected to die, nothing less, and was quite resigned to do so, because she had lost all hope of winning the prince. ",16766,16944
144,"So she gave the apple another push, and it rolled into a meadow in the middle of the garden, and there lay two little children, asleep, with the hot sun beating straight down upon them. ",16944,17130
145,"The maiden felt sorry for the children, and she took her apron and laid it over them to protect them from[ the sun, and only kept the apples she could put in her little basket. ",17130,17307
146,"But she could not stay here either, so again she touched the apple, and it rolled on and before she knew it the girl found herself by the sea-shore. ",17307,17456
147,"There, under a shady tree lay the prince asleep; ",17456,17505
148, while beside him sat the sea-queen. ,17504,17541
149,"Both rose when the maiden drew near, and the prince looked at her with alarm and tenderness in his flashing eyes. ",17541,17655
150,"Then he leaped into the sea, and the white foam closed over him. ",17655,17720
151,"But the sea-queen was enraged and seized the girl, who thought that her last moment had struck, and begged for a merciful death. ",17720,17849
152,"The sea-queen looked at her, and asked her who had given her permission to pass beyond the apple-tree. ",17849,17952
153,"The maiden confessed her disobedience, and said that she had done so without meaning any harm, whereupon the sea-queen said she would see how she had conducted herself and punish her accordingly. ",17952,18148
154,"Thereupon the sea-queen gave the apple a push, and it rolled back through the portal to the apple-tree. ",18148,18252
155,"The sea-queen saw that the apple-tree was uninjured, again pushed the apple and it rolled on to the little fire-place. ",18252,18371
156,"But when the sea-queen saw the small kettle boiling furiously, while the large one was growing cold, she became very angry, seized the girl's arm savagely and rising to her full height, asked: ""What have you dared do here? ",18371,18594
157,"How dared you take the fire from under my kettle and put it under your own?"" ",18594,18671
158,"The maiden did not know that she had done anything wrong, and said that she did not know why. ",18671,18765
159,"Then the sea-queen replied: ""The large kettle signified the love between the prince and myself; ",18765,18861
160, the small one the love between the prince and you. ,18860,18912
161,"Since you have taken the fire from under my kettle and laid it under your own, the prince is now violently in love with you, while his love for me is well-nigh extinguished."" ",18912,19087
162,"""Look,"" she cried, angrily, ""now my kettle has stopped boiling altogether, and yours is boiling over! ",19087,19189
163,"But I will see what other harm you have done and punish you accordingly."" ",19189,19263
164,"And the sea-queen again pushed the apple with her foot, and it rolled to the sleeping children, who had been covered with the apron. ",19263,19396
165,"Then the sea-queen said: ""Did you do that?"" ",19396,19440
166,"""Yes,"" replied the maiden, weeping, ""but I meant no harm. ",19440,19498
167,"I covered the little ones with my apron so that the sun might not burn down on them so fiercely, and I left with them the apples I could not put in my basket."" ",19498,19658
168,"The sea-queen said: ""This deed and your truthfulness are your salvation. ",19658,19731
169,I see that you have a kind heart. ,19731,19765
170,These children belong to me and to the prince; ,19765,19812
171," but since he now loves you more than he does me, I will resign him to you. ",19811,19887
172,Go back to the castle and there say what I tell you: that your wedding with my prince is to be celebrated at the same time as that of his younger brother. ,19887,20042
173,"And all your jewels, your ornaments, your wedding-dress and your bridal chair, are to be exactly like those of the other princess. ",20042,20173
174,From the moment on that the priest blesses the prince and yourself I have no further power over him. ,20173,20274
175,"But since I have seen to it that he has all the qualities which adorn a ruler, I demand that he be made the heir to his father's kingdom; ",20274,20412
176, for he is the oldest son. ,20411,20438
177,The younger prince may rule over the kingdom which his bride brings him. ,20438,20511
178,"All this you must tell them, for only under these conditions will I release the prince. ",20511,20599
179,"And when you are arrayed in your bridal finery, come to me here, without anyone's knowledge, so that I may see how they have adorned you. ",20599,20737
180,"Here is the apple which will show you the way without any one being able to tell where you go."" ",20737,20833
181,"With that the sea-queen parted from her, and gave the apple a push. ",20833,20901
182,"It rolled out of the garden and to the castle, where the maiden, with mingled joy and terror, delivered the sea-queen's message to the king, and told him what she demanded for the prince. ",20901,21089
183,"The king gladly promised all that was desired, and great preparations were at once made for the double wedding. ",21089,21201
184,"Two bridal chairs were set up side by side, two wedding gowns, and two sets of jewels exactly similar were made ready. ",21201,21320
185,"When the maiden had been dressed in her bridal finery she pretended to have forgotten something, which she had to fetch from a lower floor, went downstairs with her apple, and laid it on the ground. ",21320,21519
186,"It at once rolled to the spot by the sea-shore where she had found the sea-queen and the prince, and where the sea-queen was now awaiting her. ",21519,21662
187,"""It is well that you have come,"" said the sea-queen, ""for the slightest disobedience would have meant misfortune for you! ",21662,21784
188,But how do you look? ,21784,21805
189,Are you dressed just as the princess is? ,21805,21846
190,"And has the princess no better clothes or jewels?"" ",21846,21897
191,"The maiden answered timidly, that they were dressed exactly alike. ",21897,21964
192,"Then the sea-queen tore her gown from her body, unclasped the jewels from her hair and flinging them on the ground cried: ""Is that the way the bride of my prince should look! ",21964,22139
193,"Since I have given him to you I will give you my bridal outfit as well."" ",22139,22212
194,"And with that she raised up a sod beneath the great tree, and a shrine adorned with gold and precious stones appeared, from which she drew out her bridal outfit, which fitted the maiden as though made for her. ",22212,22422
195,And it was so costly and so covered with gems that the maiden was almost blinded by its radiance. ,22422,22520
196,"The crown, too, glowed with light, and was set with the most wonderful emeralds, and all was magnificent beyond what any princess had ever worn. ",22520,22665
197,"""Now,"" said the sea-queen, when she had finished adorning the maiden, ""now go back to the castle, and show them how I was dressed when I wedded the prince. ",22665,22821
198,All this I give as a free gift to you and your descendants; ,22821,22881
199," but you must always conduct yourself so that the prince will be content with you, and you must make his happiness your first thought all your life long."" ",22880,23035
200,"This the maiden promised, with honest tears, and the sea-queen bade her go. ",23035,23111
201,"When she was again in the castle, all were astonished at the beauty and costliness of her dress and jewels, in comparison to which those of the other princess were as nothing. ",23111,23287
202,The treasures of the whole kingdom would not have sufficed to pay for such a bridal outfit. ,23287,23379
203,"And none any longer dared envy the lovely maiden, for never had a princess brought a richer bridal dower into the country. ",23379,23502
204,"Now all went in solemn procession to the church, and the priests stood before the bridal chairs with their books open, and waited for the prince who, according to the sea-queen's word, would not come until the blessing was to be spoken. ",23502,23739
205,"They waited impatiently, and the king finally told one of the greatest nobles to seat himself in the bridal chair in the prince's place, which he did. ",23739,23890
206,"But the very moment the priest began to pray, the two wings of the church portal quickly flew open, and a tall, strong, handsome man with flashing eyes, royally clad, came in, stepped up to the bridal chair, thrust his proxy out so hastily that he nearly fell, and cried: ""This is my place! ",23890,24181
207,"Now, priest, speak the blessing!"" ",24181,24215
208,"While the blessing was spoken the prince became quiet again, and then greeted his parents and the whole court with joy, and before all embraced his wife, who now for the first time ventured to take a good look at him. ",24215,24433
209,"From then on the prince was like any other human being, and in the end he inherited his father's kingdom, and became a great and world-renowned ruler, beloved by his subjects, and adored by his wife. ",24433,24633
210,"They lived long and happily, and their descendants are still the rulers of the land over which he reigned.",24633,24740
