0,"Long, long ago, there lived an old man and his wife who had three sons; ",0,72
1," the eldest was called Martin, the second Michael, while the third was named Jack. ",71,154
2,"One evening they were all seated round the table, eating their supper of bread and milk. ",154,243
3,"'Martin,' said the old man suddenly, 'I feel that I cannot live much longer. ",243,320
4,"You, as the eldest, will inherit this hut; ",320,363
5," but, if you value my blessing, be good to your mother and brothers.' ",362,432
6,"'Certainly, father; ",432,452
7, how can you suppose I should do them wrong?' ,451,497
8,"replied Martin indignantly, helping himself to all the best bits in the dish as he spoke. ",497,587
9,"The old man saw nothing, but Michael looked on in surprise, and Jack was so astonished that he quite forgot to eat his own supper. ",587,718
10,"A little while after, the father fell ill, and sent for his sons, who were out hunting, to bid him farewell. ",718,827
11,"After giving good advice to the two eldest, he turned to Jack. ",827,890
12,"'My boy,' he said, 'you have not got quite as much sense as other people, but if Heaven has deprived you of some of your wits, it was given you a kind heart. ",890,1048
13,"Always listen to what it says, and take heed to the words of your mother and brothers, as well as you are able!' ",1048,1161
14,So saying the old man sank back on his pillows and died. ,1161,1218
15,"The cries of grief uttered by Martin and Michael sounded through the house, but Jack remained by the bedside of his father, still and silent, as if he were dead also. ",1218,1385
16,"At length he got up, and going into the garden, hid himself in some trees, and wept like a child, while his two brothers made ready for the funeral. ",1385,1534
17,"No sooner was the old man buried than Martin and Michael agreed that they would go into the world together to seek their fortunes, while Jack stayed at home with their mother. ",1534,1710
18,"Jack would have liked nothing better than to sit and dream by the fire, but the mother, who was very old herself, declared that there was no work for him to do, and that he must seek it with his brothers. ",1710,1915
19,"So, one fine morning, all three set out; ",1915,1956
20," Martin and Michael carried two great bags full of food, but Jack carried nothing. ",1955,2038
21,"This made his brothers very angry, for the day was hot and the bags were heavy, and about noon they sat down under a tree and began to eat. ",2038,2178
22,"Jack was as hungry as they were, but he knew that it was no use asking for anything; ",2178,2263
23," and he threw himself under another tree, and wept bitterly. ",2262,2323
24,"'Another time perhaps you won't be so lazy, and will bring food for yourself,' said Martin, but to his surprise Jack answered: 'You are a nice pair! ",2323,2472
25,"You talk of seeking your fortunes so as not to be a burden on our mother, and you begin by carrying off all the food she has in the house!' ",2472,2612
26,This reply was so unexpected that for some moments neither of the brothers made any answer. ,2612,2704
27,"Then they offered their brother some of their food, and when he had finished eating they went their way once more. ",2704,2819
28,"Towards evening they reached a small hut, and knocking at the door, asked if they might spend the night there. ",2819,2930
29,"The man, who was a wood-cutter, invited them him, and begged them to sit down to supper. ",2930,3019
30,"Martin thanked him, but being very proud, explained that it was only shelter they wanted, as they had plenty of food with them; ",3019,3147
31," and he and Michael at once opened their bags and began to eat, while Jack hid himself in a corner. ",3146,3246
32,"The wife, on seeing this, took pity on him, and called him to come and share their supper, which he gladly did, and very good he found it. ",3246,3385
33,"At this, Martin regretted deeply that he had been so foolish as to refuse, for his bits of bread and cheese seemed very hard when he smelt the savoury soup his brother was enjoying. ",3385,3567
34,"'He shan't have such a chance again,' thought he; ",3567,3617
35, and the next morning he insisted on plunging into a thick forest where they were likely to meet nobody. ,3616,3721
36,"For a long time they wandered hither and thither, for they had no path to guide them; ",3721,3807
37," but at last they came upon a wide clearing, in the midst of which stood a castle. ",3806,3889
38,"Jack shouted with delight, but Martin, who was in a bad temper, said sharply: 'We must have taken a wrong turning! ",3889,4004
39,Let us go back.' ,4004,4021
40,'Idiot!' ,4021,4030
41,"replied Michael, who was hungry too, and, like many people when they are hungry, very cross also. ",4030,4128
42,"'We set out to travel through the world, and what does it matter if we go to the right or to the left?' ",4128,4232
43,"And, without another word, took the path to the castle, closely followed by Jack, and after a moment by Martin likewise. ",4232,4353
44,"The door of the castle stood open, and they entered a great hall, and looked about them. ",4353,4442
45,"Not a creature was to be seen, and suddenly Martin-he did not know why-felt a little frightened. ",4442,4539
46,"He would have left the castle at once, but stopped when Jack boldly walked up to a door in the wall and opened it. ",4539,4654
47,"He could not for very shame be outdone by his younger brother, and passed behind him into another splendid hall, which was filled from floor to ceiling with great pieces of copper money. ",4654,4841
48,"The sight quite dazzled Martin and Michael, who emptied all the provisions that remained out of their bags, and heaped them up instead with handfuls of copper. ",4841,5001
49,"Scarcely had they done this when Jack threw open another door, and this time it led to a hall filled with silver. ",5001,5115
50,"In an instant his brothers had turned their bags upside down, so that the copper money tumbled out on to the floor, and were shovelling in handfuls of the silver instead. ",5115,5286
51,"They had hardly finished, when Jack opened yet a third door, and all three fell back in amazement, for this room as a mass of gold, so bright that their eyes grew sore as they looked at it. ",5286,5476
52,"However, they soon recovered from their surprise, and quickly emptied their bags of silver, and filled them with gold instead. ",5476,5603
53,"When they would hold no more, Martin said: 'We had better hurry off now lest somebody else should come, and we might not know what to do';",5603,5741
54," and, followed by Michael, he hastily left the castle. ",5741,5796
55,"Jack lingered behind for a few minutes to put pieces of gold, silver, and copper into his pocket, and to eat the food that his brothers had thrown down in the first room. ",5796,5967
56,"Then he went after them, and found them lying down to rest in the midst of a forest. ",5967,6052
57,"It was near sunset, and Martin began to feel hungry, so, when Jack arrived, he bade him return to the castle and bring the bread and cheese that they had left there. ",6052,6218
58,"'It is hardly worth doing that,' answered Jack; ",6218,6266
59, 'for I picked up the pieces and ate them myself.' ,6265,6316
60,"At this reply both brothers were beside themselves with anger, and fell upon the boy, beating him, and calling him names, till they were quite tired. ",6316,6466
61,"'Go where you like,' cried Martin with a final kick; ",6466,6519
62, 'but never come near us again.' ,6518,6551
63,And poor Jack ran weeping into the woods. ,6551,6593
64,"The next morning his brothers went home, and bought a beautiful house, where they lived with their mother like great lords. ",6593,6717
65,"Jack remained for some hours in hiding, thankful to be safe from his tormentors; ",6717,6798
66," but when no one came to trouble him, and his back did not ache so much, he began to think what he had better do. ",6797,6911
67,At length he made up his mind to go to the caste and take away as much money with him as would enable him to live in comfort for the rest of his life. ,6911,7062
68,"This being decided, he sprang up, and set out along the path which led to the castle. ",7062,7148
69,"As before, the door stood open, and he went on till he had reached the hall of gold, and there he took off his jacket and tied the sleeves together so that it might make a kind of bag. ",7148,7333
70,"He then began to pour in the gold by handfuls, when, all at once, a noise like thunder shook the castle. ",7333,7438
71,"This was followed by a voice, hoarse as that of a bull, which cried: 'I smell the smell of a man.' ",7438,7537
72,And two giants entered. ,7537,7561
73,"'So, little worm! ",7561,7579
74,it is you who steal our treasures!' ,7579,7615
75,exclaimed the biggest. ,7615,7638
76,"'Well, we have got you now, and we will cook you for supper!' ",7638,7700
77,"But here the other giant drew him aside, and for a moment or two they whispered together. ",7700,7790
78,"At length the first giant spoke: 'To please my friend I will spare your life on condition that, for the future, you shall guard our treasures. ",7790,7933
79,"If you are hungry take this little table and rap on it, saying, as you do so: ""The dinner of an emperor!"" ",7933,8039
80,and you will get as much food as you want.' ,8039,8083
81,"With a light heart Jack promised all that was asked of him, and for some days enjoyed himself mightily. ",8083,8187
82,"He had everything he could wish for, and did nothing from morning till night; ",8187,8265
83, but by-and-by he began to get very tired of it all. ,8264,8317
84,"'Let the giants guard their treasures themselves,' he said to himself at last; ",8317,8396
85, 'I am going away. ,8395,8414
86,"But I will leave all the gold and silver behind me, and will take nought but you, my good little table.' ",8414,8519
87,"So, tucking the table under his arm, he started off for the forest, but he did not linger there long, and soon found himself in the fields on the other side. ",8519,8677
88,"There he saw an old man, who begged Jack to give him something to eat. ",8677,8748
89,"'You could not have asked a better person,' answered Jack cheerfully. ",8748,8818
90,"And signing to him to sit down with him under a tree, he set the table in front of them, and struck it three times, crying: 'The dinner of an emperor!' ",8818,8970
91,He had hardly uttered the words when fish and meat of all kinds appeared on it! ,8970,9050
92,"'That is a clever trick of yours,' said the old man, when he had eaten as much as he wanted. ",9050,9143
93,'Give it to me in exchange for a treasure I have which is still better. ,9143,9215
94,Do you see this cornet? ,9215,9239
95,"Well, you have only to tell it that you wish for an army, and you will have as many soldiers as you require.' ",9239,9349
96,"Now, since he had been left to himself, Jack had grown ambitious, so, after a moment's hesitation, he took the cornet and gave the table in exchange. ",9349,9499
97,"The old man bade him farewell, and set off down one path, while Jack chose another, and for a long time he was quite pleased with his new possession. ",9499,9649
98,"Then, as he felt hungry, he wished for his table back again, as no house was in sight, and he wanted some supper badly. ",9649,9769
99,"All at once he remembered his cornet, and a wicked thought entered his mind. ",9769,9846
100,"'Two hundred hussars, forward!' ",9846,9878
101,cried he. ,9878,9888
102,And the neighing of horses and the clanking of swords were heard close at hand. ,9888,9968
103,"The officer who rode at their head approached Jack, and politely inquired what he wished them to do. ",9968,10069
104,"'A mile or two along that road,' answered Jack, 'you will find an old man carrying a table. ",10069,10161
105,Take the table from him and bring it to me.' ,10161,10206
106,"The officer saluted and went back to his men, who started at a gallop to do Jack's bidding. ",10206,10298
107,"In ten minutes they had returned, bearing the table with them. ",10298,10361
108,"'That is all, thank you,' said Jack; ",10361,10398
109, and the soldiers disappeared inside the cornet. ,10397,10446
110,"Oh, what a good supper Jack had that night, quite forgetting that he owed it to a mean trick. ",10446,10540
111,"The next day he breakfasted early, and then walked on towards the nearest town. ",10540,10620
112,"On the way thither he met another old man, who begged for something to eat. ",10620,10696
113,"'Certainly, you shall have something to eat,' replied Jack. ",10696,10756
114,"And, placing the table on the ground he cried: 'The dinner of an emperor!' ",10756,10831
115,when all sorts of food dishes appeared. ,10831,10871
116,"At first the old man ate quite greedily, and said nothing; ",10871,10930
117," but, after his hunger was satisfied, he turned to Jack and said: 'That is a very clever trick of yours. ",10929,11034
118,Give the table to me and you shall have something still better.' ,11034,11099
119,"'I don't believe that there is anything better,' answered Jack. ",11099,11163
120,"'Yes, there is. ",11163,11179
121,Here is my bag; ,11179,11195
122, it will give you as many castles as you can possibly want.' ,11194,11255
123,Jack thought for a moment; ,11255,11282
124," then he replied: 'Very well, I will exchange with you.' ",11281,11338
125,"And passing the table to the old man, he hung the bag over his arm. ",11338,11406
126,Five minutes later he summoned five hundred lancers out of the cornet and bade them go after the old man and fetch back the table. ,11406,11537
127,"Now that by his cunning he had obtained possession of the three magic objects, he resolved to return to his native place. ",11537,11659
128,"Smearing his face with dirt, and tearing his clothes so as to look like a beggar, he stopped the passers by and, on pretence of seeking money or food, he questioned them about the village gossip. ",11659,11855
129,"In this manner he learned that his brothers had become great men, much respected in all the country round. ",11855,11962
130,"When he heard that, he lost no time in going to the door of their fine house and imploring them to give him food and shelter; ",11962,12088
131," but the only thing he got was hard words, and a command to beg elsewhere. ",12087,12162
132,"At length, however, at their mother's entreaty, he was told that he might pass the night in the stable. ",12162,12266
133,"Here he waited until everybody in the house was sound asleep, when he drew his bag from under his cloak, and desired that a castle might appear in that place; ",12266,12425
134," and the cornet gave him soldiers to guard the castle, while the table furnished him with a good supper. ",12424,12529
135,"In the morning, he caused it all to vanish, and when his brothers entered the stable they found him lying on the straw. ",12529,12649
136,"Jack remained here for many days, doing nothing, and-as far as anybody knew-eating nothing. ",12649,12741
137,"This conduct puzzled his brothers greatly, and they put such constant questions to him, that at length he told them the secret of the table, and even gave a dinner to them, which far outdid any they had ever seen or heard of. ",12741,12967
138,"But though they had solemnly promised to reveal nothing, somehow or other the tale leaked out, and before long reached the ears of the king himself. ",12967,13116
139,"That very evening his chamberlain arrived at Jack's dwelling, with a request from the king that he might borrow the table for three days. ",13116,13254
140,"'Very well,' answered Jack, 'you can take it back with you. ",13254,13314
141,But tell his majesty that if he does not return it at the end of the three days I will make war upon him.' ,13314,13421
142,"So the chamberlain carried away the table and took it straight to the king, telling him at the same time of Jack's threat, at which they both laughed till their sides ached. ",13421,13595
143,"Now the king was so delighted with the table, and the dinners it gave him, that when the three days were over he could not make up his mind to part with it. ",13595,13752
144,"Instead, he sent for his carpenter, and bade him copy it exactly, and when it was done he told his chamberlain to return it to Jack with his best thanks. ",13752,13906
145,"It happened to be dinner time, and Jack invited the chamberlain, who knew nothing of the trick, to stay and dine with him. ",13906,14029
146,"The good man, who had eaten several excellent meals provided by the table in the last three days, accepted the invitation with pleasure, even though he was to dine in a stable, and sat down on the straw beside Jack. ",14029,14245
147,'The dinner of an emperor!' ,8942,8970
148,cried Jack. ,14273,14285
149,But not even a morsel of cheese made its appearance. ,14285,14338
150,'The dinner of an emperor!' ,8942,8970
151,shouted Jack in a voice of thunder. ,14366,14402
152,Then the truth dawned on him; ,14402,14432
153," and, crushing the table between his hands, he turned to the chamberlain, who, bewildered and half-frightened, was wondering how to get away. ",14431,14573
154,'Tell your false king that to-morrow I will destroy his castle as easily as I have broken this table.' ,14573,14676
155,"The chamberlain hastened back to the palace, and gave the king Jack's message, at which he laughed more than before, and called all his courtiers to hear the story. ",14676,14841
156,"But they were not quite so merry when they woke next morning and beheld ten thousand horsemen, and as many archers, surrounding the palace. ",14841,14981
157,"The king saw it was useless to hold out, and he took the white flag of truce in one hand, and the real table in the other, and set out to look for Jack. ",14981,15134
158,"'I committed a crime,' said he; ",15134,15166
159, 'but I will do my best to make up for it. ,15165,15208
160,"Here is your table, which I own with shame that I tried to steal, and you shall have besides, my daughter as your wife!' ",15208,15329
161,"There was no need to delay the marriage when the table was able to furnish the most splendid banquet that ever was seen, and after everyone had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted, Jack took his bag and commanded a castle filled with all sorts of treasures to arise in the park for himself and his bride. ",15329,15637
162,At this proof of his power the king's heart died within him. ,15637,15698
163,"'Your magic is greater than mine,' he said; ",15698,15742
164," 'and you are young and strong, while I am old and tired. ",15741,15799
165,"Take, therefore, the sceptre from my hand, and my crown from my head, and rule my people better than I have done.' ",15799,15914
166,So at last Jack's ambition was satisfied. ,15914,15956
167,"He could not hope to be more than king, and as long as he had his cornet to provide him with soldiers he was secure against his enemies. ",15956,16093
168,"He never forgave his brothers for the way they had treated him, though he presented his mother with a beautiful castle, and everything she could possibly wish for. ",16093,16257
169,"In the centre of his own palace was a treasure chamber, and in this chamber the table, the cornet, and the bag were kept as the most prized of all his possessions, and not a week passed without a visit from king John to make sure they were safe. ",16257,16503
170,"He reigned long and well, and died a very old man, beloved by his people.",16503,16577
