0,"Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons, who were all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead. ",0,181
1,"Now the King, though he felt that he was growing old, did not at all wish to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well, so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for keeping them. ",181,505
2,"So he sent for them all, and, after speaking to them kindly, he added: ""You will quite agree with me, my dear children, that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did. ",505,732
3,"I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects, therefore I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown; ",732,858
4, but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me. ,857,950
5,"Now, as I think of retiring into the country, it seems to me that a pretty, lively, faithful little dog would be very good company for me; ",950,1089
6," so, without any regard for your ages, I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once."" ",1088,1221
7,"The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father's sudden fancy for a little dog, but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they would not otherwise have had of being king, and as the eldest was too polite to make any objection, they accepted the commission with pleasure. ",1221,1505
8,"They bade farewell to the King, who gave them presents of silver and precious stones, and appointed to meet them at the same hour, in the same place, after a year had passed, to see the little dogs they had brought for him. ",1505,1729
9,"Then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city, accompanied by all their particular friends, to whom they gave a grand banquet, and the three brothers promised to be friends always, to share whatever good fortune befell them, and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy; ",1729,2029
10," and so they set out, agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time, to present themselves before the King together. ",2028,2157
11,"Each one took a different road, and the two eldest met with many adventures; ",2157,2234
12, but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear. ,2233,2291
13,"He was young, and gay, and handsome, and knew everything that a prince ought to know; ",2291,2377
14," and as for his courage, there was simply no end to it. ",2376,2432
15,"Hardly a day passed without his buying several dogs-big and little, greyhounds, mastiffs, spaniels, and lapdogs. ",2432,2545
16,"As soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier, and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one, as, being alone, he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him. ",2545,2777
17,"He journeyed from day to day, not knowing where he was going, until at last, just at nightfall, he reached a great, gloomy forest. ",2777,2908
18,"He did not know his way, and, to make matters worse, it began to thunder, and the rain poured down. ",2908,3008
19,"He took the first path he could find, and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light, and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night. ",3008,3209
20,"At length, guided by the light, he reached the door of the most splendid castle he could have imagined. ",3209,3313
21,"This door was of gold covered with carbuncles, and it was the pure red light which shone from them that had shown him the way through the forest. ",3313,3459
22,"The walls were of the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors, and the Prince saw that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them; ",3459,3613
23," but as he was terribly wet, and the rain still fell in torrents, he could not stay to look about any more, but came back to the golden door. ",3612,3754
24,"There he saw a deer's foot hanging by a chain of diamonds, and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle. ",3754,3879
25,"""They must feel very secure against robbers,"" he said to himself. ",3879,3945
26,"""What is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those carbuncles, and making himself rich for life?"" ",3945,4068
27,"He pulled the deer's foot, and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open, but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air, each holding a torch. ",4068,4245
28,"He was so much surprised that he stood quite still, until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands, so that, though he was somewhat uneasy, he could not help going on. ",4245,4418
29,"With his hand on his sword, to be prepared for whatever might happen, he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli, while two lovely voices sang: ""The hands you see floating above Will swiftly your bidding obey; ",4418,4627
30," If your heart dreads not conquering Love, In this place you may fearlessly stay."" ",4626,4709
31,"The Prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was welcomed in this way, so, guided by the mysterious hands, he went toward a door of coral, which opened of its own accord, and he found himself in a vast hall of mother-of-pearl, out of which opened a number of other rooms, glittering with thousands of lights, and full of such beautiful pictures and precious things that the Prince felt quite bewildered. ",4709,5136
32,"After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped, and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner; ",5136,5302
33," at the same moment the fire lighted itself, and the pretty, soft, clever hands took off the Prince's wet, muddy clothes, and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs, all embroidered with gold and emeralds. ",5301,5525
34,"He could not help admiring everything he saw, and the deft way in which the hands waited on him, though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump. ",5525,5690
35,"When he was quite ready-and I can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain, and pulled the deer's foot-the hands led him to a splendid room, upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and a number of other famous cats. ",5690,5998
36,"The table was laid for supper with two golden plates, and golden spoons and forks, and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones. ",5998,6172
37,"The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for, when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music, who took their places at one end of the room, and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key, and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars, making the strangest kind of music that could be heard. ",6172,6577
38,"The Prince hastily stopped up his ears, but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter. ",6577,6700
39,"""What funny thing shall I see next?"" ",6700,6737
40,"he said to himself, and instantly the door opened, and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil. ",6737,6844
41,"It was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords, and a large party of cats followed, who brought in cages full of rats and mice. ",6844,6996
42,"The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming, but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil, and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine. ",6996,7210
43,"She looked very young and very sad, and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the Prince: ""King's son, you are welcome; ",7210,7360
44," the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you."" ",7359,7403
45,"""Lady Cat,"" replied the Prince, ""I thank you for receiving me so kindly, but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat? ",7403,7518
46,"Indeed, the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly."" ",7518,7599
47,"""King's son,"" said the White Cat, ""I beg you to spare me these compliments, for I am not used to them. ",7599,7702
48,"But now,"" she added, ""let supper be served, and let the musicians be silent, as the Prince does not understand what they are saying."" ",7702,7836
49,"So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper, and first they put on the table two dishes, one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice. ",7836,8003
50,The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all; ,8003,8092
51," but the White Cat, seeing this, assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen, and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice; ",8091,8279
52, and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning. ,8278,8383
53,"Presently he noticed that on the little paw that was next him the White Cat wore a bracelet containing a portrait, and he begged to be allowed to look at it. ",8383,8541
54,"To his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man, who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait! ",8541,8686
55,"The White Cat sighed as he looked at it, and seemed sadder than ever, and the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her; ",8686,8828
56," so he began to talk about other things, and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself, and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world. ",8827,9006
57,"After supper they went into another room, which was fitted up as a theatre, and the cats acted and danced for their amusement, and then the White Cat said good-night to him, and the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before, hung with tapestry worked with butterflies' wings of every color; ",9006,9310
58," there were mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor, and a little white bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons. ",9309,9441
59,"The Prince went to bed in silence, as he did not quite know how to begin a conversation with the hands that waited on him, and in the morning he was awakened by a noise and confusion outside of his window, and the hands came and quickly dressed him in hunting costume. ",9441,9710
60,"When he looked out all the cats were assembled in the courtyard, some leading greyhounds, some blowing horns, for the White Cat was going out hunting. ",9710,9861
61,"The hands led a wooden horse up to the Prince, and seemed to expect him to mount it, at which he was very indignant; ",9861,9978
62," but it was no use for him to object, for he speedily found himself upon its back, and it pranced gaily off with him. ",9977,10095
63,"The White Cat herself was riding a monkey, which climbed even up to the eagles' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets. ",10095,10225
64,"Never was there a pleasanter hunting party, and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before, but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet, which must have contained a magic draught, for, as soon as he had swallowed its contents, he forgot everything, even the little dog that he was seeking for the King, and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat! ",10225,10649
65,"And so the days passed, in every kind of amusement, until the year was nearly gone. ",10649,10733
66,The Prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers: he did not even know what country he belonged to; ,10733,10840
67," but the White Cat knew when he ought to go back, and one day she said to him: ""Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father, and your brothers have found lovely ones?"" ",10839,11053
68,"Then the Prince suddenly recovered his memory, and cried: ""What can have made me forget such an important thing? ",11053,11166
69,My whole fortune depends upon it; ,11166,11200
70," and even if I could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom, where should I find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days?"" ",11199,11364
71,And he began to be very vexed. ,11364,11395
72,"But the White Cat said to him: ""King's son, do not trouble yourself; ",11395,11464
73," I am your friend, and will make everything easy for you. ",11463,11521
74,"You can still stay here for a day, as the good wooden horse can take you to your country in twelve hours."" ",11521,11628
75,"""I thank you, beautiful Cat,"" said the Prince; ",11628,11675
76," ""but what good will it do me to get back if I have not a dog to take to my father?"" ",11674,11759
77,"""See here,"" answered the White Cat, holding up an acorn; ",11759,11816
78," ""there is a prettier one in this than in the Dogstar!"" ",11815,11871
79,"""Oh! ",11871,11876
80,"White Cat dear,"" said the Prince, ""how unkind you are to laugh at me now!"" ",11876,11951
81,"""Only listen,"" she said, holding the acorn to his ear. ",11951,12006
82,"And inside it he distinctly heard a tiny voice say: ""Bow-wow!"" ",12006,12069
83,"The Prince was delighted, for a dog that can be shut up in an acorn must be very small indeed. ",12069,12164
84,"He wanted to take it out and look at it, but the White Cat said it would be better not to open the acorn till he was before the King, in case the tiny dog should be cold on the journey. ",12164,12350
85,"He thanked her a thousand times, and said good-by quite sadly when the time came for him to set out. ",12350,12451
86,"""The days have passed so quickly with you,"" he said, ""I only wish I could take you with me now."" ",12451,12548
87,But the White Cat shook her head and sighed deeply in answer. ,12548,12610
88,"After all the Prince was the first to arrive at the castle where he had agreed to meet his brothers, but they came soon after, and stared in amazement when they saw the wooden horse in the courtyard jumping like a hunter. ",12610,12832
89,"The Prince met them joyfully, and they began to tell him all their adventures; ",12832,12911
90," but he managed to hide from them what he had been doing, and even led them to think that a turnspit dog which he had with him was the one he was bringing for the King. ",12910,13079
91,"Fond as they all were of one another, the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs certainly had a better chance. ",13079,13214
92,The next morning they started in the same chariot. ,13214,13265
93,"The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny, fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them. ",13265,13369
94,"As for the turnspit, he ran after the chariot, and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all. ",13369,13495
95,When they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the King's great hall; ,13495,13604
96, and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier. ,13603,13702
97,"They were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally, when the youngest stepped forward, drawing from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him. ",13702,13877
98,"He opened it quickly, and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring. ",13877,14005
99,"The Prince laid it upon the ground, and it got up at once and began to dance. ",14005,14083
100,"The King did not know what to say, for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature. ",14083,14199
101,"Nevertheless, as he was in no hurry to part with his crown, he told his sons that, as they had been so successful the first time, he would ask them to go once again, and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle. ",14199,14472
102,"The brothers were not very willing to set out again, but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance, and they started as before. ",14472,14619
103,"The youngest again mounted the wooden horse, and rode back at full speed to his beloved White Cat. ",14619,14718
104,"Every door of the castle stood wide open, and every window and turret was illuminated, so it looked more wonderful than before. ",14718,14846
105,"The hands hastened to meet him, and led the wooden horse off to the stable, while he hurried in to find the White Cat. ",14846,14965
106,"She was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion, but she very soon started up when she heard the Prince, and was overjoyed at seeing him once more. ",14965,15124
107,"""How could I hope that you would come back to me King's son?"" ",15124,15186
108,she said. ,15186,15196
109,"And then he stroked and petted her, and told her of his successful journey, and how he had come back to ask her help, as he believed that it was impossible to find what the King demanded. ",15196,15384
110,"The White Cat looked serious, and said she must think what was to be done, but that, luckily, there were some cats in the castle who could spin very well, and if anybody could manage it they could, and she would set them the task herself. ",15384,15623
111,"And then the hands appeared carrying torches, and conducted the Prince and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river, from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts; ",15623,15842
112," after which they had supper, which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks, for it was very late, and he was hungry after his long ride. ",15841,15987
113,And so the days passed quickly as before; ,15987,16029
114," it was impossible to feel dull with the White Cat, and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements-indeed, she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be. ",16028,16193
115,"But when the Prince asked her how it was that she was so wise, she only said: ""King's son, do not ask me; ",16193,16299
116, guess what you please. ,16298,16322
117,"I may not tell you anything."" ",16322,16352
118,"The Prince was so happy that he did not trouble himself at all about the time, but presently the White Cat told him that the year was gone, and that he need not be at all anxious about the piece of muslin, as they had made it very well. ",16352,16589
119,"""This time,"" she added, ""I can give you a suitable escort"";",16589,16648
120," and on looking out into the courtyard the Prince saw a superb chariot of burnished gold, enameled in flame color with a thousand different devices. ",16648,16797
121,"It was drawn by twelve snow-white horses, harnessed four abreast; ",16797,16863
122," their trappings were flame-colored velvet, embroidered with diamonds. ",16862,16933
123,"A hundred chariots followed, each drawn by eight horses, and filled with officers in splendid uniforms, and a thousand guards surrounded the procession. ",16933,17086
124,"""Go!"" ",17086,17092
125,"said the White Cat, ""and when you appear before the King in such state he surely will not refuse you the crown which you deserve. ",17092,17222
126,"Take this walnut, but do not open it until you are before him, then you will find in it the piece of stuff you asked me for."" ",17222,17348
127,"""Lovely Blanchette,"" said the Prince, ""how can I thank you properly for all your kindness to me? ",17348,17445
128,"Only tell me that you wish it, and I will give up for ever all thought of being king, and will stay here with you always."" ",17445,17568
129,"""King's son,"" she replied, ""it shows the goodness of your heart that you should care so much for a little white cat, who is good for nothing but to catch mice; ",17568,17728
130," but you must not stay."" ",17727,17752
131,So the Prince kissed her little paw and set out. ,17752,17801
132,You can imagine how fast he traveled when I tell you that they reached the King's palace in just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there. ,17801,17956
133,"This time the Prince was so late that he did not try to meet his brothers at their castle, so they thought he could not be coming, and were rather glad of it, and displayed their pieces of muslin to the King proudly, feeling sure of success. ",17956,18198
134,"And indeed the stuff was very fine, and would go through the eye of a very large needle; ",18198,18287
135," but the King, who was only too glad to make a difficulty, sent for a particular needle, which was kept among the Crown jewels, and had such a small eye that everybody saw at once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it. ",18286,18529
136,"The Princes were angry, and were beginning to complain that it was a trick, when suddenly the trumpets sounded and the youngest Prince came in. ",18529,18673
137,"His father and brothers were quite astonished at his magnificence, and after he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it, fully expecting to find the piece of muslin, but instead there was only a hazel-nut. ",18673,18905
138,"He cracked it, and there lay a cherry-stone. ",18905,18950
139,"Everybody was looking on, and the King was chuckling to himself at the idea of finding the piece of muslin in a nutshell. ",18950,19072
140,"However, the Prince cracked the cherry-stone, but everyone laughed when he saw it contained only its own kernel. ",19072,19185
141,"He opened that and found a grain of wheat, and in that was a millet seed. ",19185,19259
142,"Then he himself began to wonder, and muttered softly: ""White Cat, White Cat, are you making fun of me?"" ",19259,19363
143,"In an instant he felt a cat's claw give his hand quite a sharp scratch, and hoping that it was meant as an encouragement he opened the millet seed, and drew out of it a piece of muslin four hundred ells long, woven with the loveliest colors and most wonderful patterns; ",19363,19633
144, and when the needle was brought it went through the eye six times with the greatest ease! ,19632,19723
145,"The King turned pale, and the other Princes stood silent and sorrowful, for nobody could deny that this was the most marvelous piece of muslin that was to be found in the world. ",19723,19901
146,"Presently the King turned to his sons, and said, with a deep sigh: ""Nothing could console me more in my old age than to realize your willingness to gratify my wishes. ",19901,20068
147,"Go then once more, and whoever at the end of a year can bring back the loveliest princess shall be married to her, and shall, without further delay, receive the crown, for my successor must certainly be married."" ",20068,20281
148,"The Prince considered that he had earned the kingdom fairly twice over but still he was too well bred to argue about it, so he just went back to his gorgeous chariot, and, surrounded by his escort, returned to the White Cat faster than he had come. ",20281,20530
149,"This time she was expecting him, the path was strewn with flowers, and a thousand braziers were burning scented woods which perfumed the air. ",20530,20672
150,"Seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival, the White Cat waited for him. ",20672,20760
151,"""Well, King's son,"" she said, ""here you are once more, without a crown."" ",20760,20833
152,"""Madam,"" said he, ""thanks to your generosity I have earned one twice over; ",20833,20908
153," but the fact is that my father is so loth to part with it that it would be no pleasure to me to take it."" ",20907,21014
154,"""Never mind,"" she answered, ""it's just as well to try and deserve it. ",21014,21084
155,As you must take back a lovely princess with you next time I will be on the look-out for one for you. ,21084,21186
156,In the meantime let us enjoy ourselves; ,21186,21226
157," to-night I have ordered a battle between my cats and the river rats on purpose to amuse you."" ",21225,21320
158,So this year slipped away even more pleasantly than the preceding ones. ,21320,21392
159,Sometimes the Prince could not help asking the White Cat how it was she could talk. ,21392,21476
160,"""Perhaps you are a fairy,"" he said. ",21476,21512
161,"""Or has some enchanter changed you into a cat?"" ",21512,21560
162,But she only gave him answers that told him nothing. ,21560,21613
163,"Days go by so quickly when one is very happy that it is certain the Prince would never have thought of its being time to go back, when one evening as they sat together the White Cat said to him that if he wanted to take a lovely princess home with him the next day he must be prepared to do what she told him. ",21613,21923
164,"""Take this sword,"" she said, ""and cut off my head!"" ",21923,21975
165,"""I!"" ",21975,21980
166,"cried the Prince, ""I cut off your head! ",21980,22020
167,"Blanchette darling, how could I do it?"" ",22020,22060
168,"""I entreat you to do as I tell you, King's son,"" she replied. ",22060,22122
169,"The tears came into the Prince's eyes as he begged her to ask him anything but that-to set him any task she pleased as a proof of his devotion, but to spare him the grief of killing his dear Pussy. ",22122,22320
170,"But nothing he could say altered her determination, and at last he drew his sword, and desperately, with a trembling hand, cut off the little white head. ",22320,22474
171,"But imagine his astonishment and delight when suddenly a lovely princess stood before him, and, while he was still speechless with amazement, the door opened and a goodly company of knights and ladies entered, each carrying a cat's skin! ",22474,22712
172,"They hastened with every sign of joy to the Princess, kissing her hand and congratulating her on being once more restored to her natural shape. ",22712,22856
173,"She received them graciously, but after a few minutes begged that they would leave her alone with the Prince, to whom she said: ""You see, Prince, that you were right in supposing me to be no ordinary cat. ",22856,23061
174,My father reigned over six kingdoms. ,23061,23098
175,"The Queen, my mother, whom he loved dearly, had a passion for traveling and exploring, and when I was only a few weeks old she obtained his permission to visit a certain mountain of which she had heard many marvelous tales, and set out, taking with her a number of her attendants. ",23098,23379
176,On the way they had to pass near an old castle belonging to the fairies. ,23379,23452
177,"Nobody had ever been into it, but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things, and my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else. ",23452,23675
178,"She began to wish to try them for herself, and turned her steps in the direction of the garden. ",23675,23771
179,"On arriving at the door, which blazed with gold and jewels, she ordered her servants to knock loudly, but it was useless; ",23771,23893
180, it seemed as if all the inhabitants of the castle must be asleep or dead. ,23892,23967
181,"Now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit, the more the Queen was determined that have it she would. ",23967,24079
182,"So she ordered that they should bring ladders, and get over the wall into the garden; ",24079,24165
183," but though the wall did not look very high, and they tied the ladders together to make them very long, it was quite impossible to get to the top. ",24164,24311
184,"The Queen was in despair, but as night was coming on she ordered that they should encamp just where they were, and went to bed herself, feeling quite ill, she was so disappointed. ",24311,24491
185,"In the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened, and saw to her surprise a tiny, ugly old woman seated by her bedside, who said to her: 'I must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your Majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit; ",24491,24735
186," but to save you annoyance, my sisters and I will consent to give you as much as you can carry away, on one condition-that is, that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own.' ",24734,24930
187,'Ah! ,24930,24935
188,"my dear madam,' cried the Queen, 'is there nothing else that you will take for the fruit? ",24935,25025
189,I will give you my kingdoms willingly.' ,25025,25065
190,"'No,' replied the old fairy, 'we will have nothing but your little daughter. ",25065,25142
191,"She shall be as happy as the day is long, and we will give her everything that is worth having in fairy-land, but you must not see her again until she is married.' ",25142,25306
192,"'Though it is a hard condition,' said the Queen, 'I consent, for I shall certainly die if I do not taste the fruit, and so I should lose my little daughter either way.' ",25306,25475
193,"""So the old fairy led her into the castle, and, though it was still the middle of the night, the Queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told, which you can easily believe, Prince,"" said the White Cat, ""when I tell you that it was this castle that we are now in. ",25475,25771
194,"'Will you gather the fruit yourself, Queen?' ",25771,25816
195,"said the old fairy, 'or shall I call it to come to you?' ",25816,25873
196,"'I beg you to let me see it come when it is called,' cried the Queen; ",25873,25943
197, 'that will be something quite new.' ,25942,25979
198,"The old fairy whistled twice, then she cried: 'Apricots, peaches, nectarines, cherries, plums, pears, melons, grapes, apples, oranges, lemons, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, come!' ",25979,26170
199,"And in an instant they came tumbling in one over another, and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt, and the Queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them. ",26170,26336
200,You see they grew upon fairy trees. ,26336,26372
201,"The old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away, and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry. ",26372,26497
202,"Then she reminded the Queen of her agreement, and led her back to the camp, and next morning she went back to her kingdom, but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain, and when the King came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened, and asked what was the matter. ",26497,26822
203,"At first the Queen was afraid to tell him, but when, as soon as they reached the palace, five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me, she was obliged to confess what she had promised. ",26822,27028
204,"The King was very angry, and had the Queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded, and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom; ",27028,27175
205," but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met, and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country; ",27174,27316
206," and at last, after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster, the King, to save his subjects, was obliged to consent that I should be given up to the fairies. ",27315,27479
207,"This time they came themselves to fetch me, in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses, followed by the dragon, who was led with chains of diamonds. ",27479,27627
208,"My cradle was placed between the old fairies, who loaded me with caresses, and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me. ",27627,27789
209,"There I grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare, and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess, but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog, who could both talk; ",27789,27999
210," and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies, who came mounted upon the dragon. ",27998,28094
211,"One day, however, as I sat at my window I saw a handsome young prince, who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison, and who was standing and looking up at me. ",28094,28282
212,When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference. ,28282,28350
213,"You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one new to talk to, and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell, then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell. ",28350,28553
214,"But after that he came again many times and at last I consented to marry him, but the question was how was I to escape from my tower. ",28553,28687
215,"The fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning, and by great diligence I made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to the foot of the tower; ",28687,28843
216," but, alas! ",28842,28854
217,"just as my prince was helping me to descend it, the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in. ",28854,28955
218,Before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon. ,28955,29041
219,"As for me, the fairies, furious at having their plans defeated, for they intended me to marry the king of the dwarfs, and I utterly refused, changed me into a white cat. ",29041,29211
220,"When they brought me here I found all the lords and ladies of my father's court awaiting me under the same enchantment, while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible, all but their hands. ",29211,29409
221,"As they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my history, for until then I had quite believed that I was their child, and warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover. ",29409,29687
222,"""And you have won it, lovely Princess,"" interrupted the Prince. ",29687,29751
223,"""You are indeed wonderfully like him,"" resumed the Princess-""in voice, in features, and everything; ",29751,29851
224," and if you really love me all my troubles will be at an end."" ",29850,29913
225,"""And mine too,"" cried the Prince, throwing himself at her feet, ""if you will consent to marry me."" ",29913,30012
226,"""I love you already better than anyone in the world,"" she said; ",30012,30076
227," ""but now it is time to go back to your father, and we shall hear what he says about it."" ",30075,30165
228,"So the Prince gave her his hand and led her out, and they mounted the chariot together; ",30165,30253
229," it was even more splendid than before, and so was the whole company. ",30252,30322
230,"Even the horses' shoes were of rubies with diamond nails, and I suppose that is the first time such a thing was ever seen. ",30322,30445
231,"As the Princess was as kind and clever as she was beautiful, you may imagine what a delightful journey the Prince found it, for everything the Princess said seemed to him quite charming. ",30445,30632
232,"When they came near the castle where the brothers were to meet, the Princess got into a chair carried by four of the guards; ",30632,30757
233," it was hewn out of one splendid crystal, and had silken curtains, which she drew round her that she might not be seen. ",30756,30876
234,"The Prince saw his brothers walking upon the terrace, each with a lovely princess, and they came to meet him, asking if he had also found a wife. ",30876,31022
235,He said that he had found something much rarer-a white cat! ,31022,31082
236,"At which they laughed very much, and asked him if he was afraid of being eaten up by mice in the palace. ",31082,31187
237,And then they set out together for the town. ,31187,31232
238,Each prince and princess rode in a splendid carriage; ,31232,31286
239," the horses were decked with plumes of feathers, and glittered with gold. ",31285,31359
240,"After them came the youngest prince, and last of all the crystal chair, at which everybody looked with admiration and curiosity. ",31359,31488
241,When the courtiers saw them coming they hastened to tell the King. ,31488,31555
242,"""Are the ladies beautiful?"" ",31555,31583
243,he asked anxiously. ,31583,31603
244,And when they answered that nobody had ever before seen such lovely princesses he seemed quite annoyed. ,31603,31707
245,"However, he received them graciously, but found it impossible to choose between them. ",31707,31793
246,"Then turning to his youngest son he said: ""Have you come back alone, after all?"" ",31793,31874
247,"""Your Majesty,"" replied the Prince, ""will find in that crystal chair a little white cat, which has such soft paws, and mews so prettily, that I am sure you will be charmed with it."" ",31874,32056
248,"The King smiled, and went to draw back the curtains himself, but at a touch from the Princess the crystal shivered into a thousand splinters, and there she stood in all her beauty; ",32056,32237
249," her fair hair floated over her shoulders and was crowned with flowers, and her softly falling robe was of the purest white. ",32236,32361
250,"She saluted the King gracefully, while a murmur of admiration rose from all around. ",32361,32445
251,"""Sire,"" she said, ""I am not come to deprive you of the throne you fill so worthily. ",32445,32529
252,"I have already six kingdoms, permit me to bestow one upon you, and upon each of your sons. ",32529,32620
253,"I ask nothing but your friendship, and your consent to my marriage with your youngest son; ",32620,32711
254," we shall still have three kingdoms left for ourselves."" ",32710,32767
255,"The King and all the courtiers could not conceal their joy and astonishment, and the marriage of the three Princes was celebrated at once. ",32767,32906
256,"The festivities lasted several months, and then each king and queen departed to their own kingdom and lived happily ever after.(",32906,33034
