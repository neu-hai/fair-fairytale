0,There was to be a great battle between all the creatures of the earth and the birds of the air. ,0,96
1,"News of it went abroad, and the son of the king of Tethertown said that when the battle was fought he would be there to see it, and would bring back word who was to be king. ",96,270
2,"But in spite of that, he was almost too late, and every fight had been fought save the last, which was between a snake and a great black raven. ",270,414
3,"Both struck hard, but in the end the snake proved the stronger, and would have twisted himself round the neck of the raven till he died had not the king's son drawn his sword, and cut off the head of the snake at a single blow. ",414,642
4,"And when the raven beheld that his enemy was dead, he was grateful, and said: 'For thy kindness to me this day, I will show thee a sight. ",642,780
5,So come up now on the root of my two wings.' ,780,825
6,"The king's son did as he was bid, and before the raven stopped flying, they had passed over seven bens and seven glens and seven mountain moors. ",825,970
7,'Do you see that house yonder?' ,970,1002
8,said the raven at last. ,1002,1026
9,"'Go straight for it, for a sister of mine dwells there, and she will make you right welcome. ",1026,1119
10,"And if she asks, ""Wert thou at the battle of the birds?"" ",1119,1176
11,"answer that thou wert, and if she asks, ""Didst thou see my likeness?"" ",1176,1246
12,"answer that thou sawest it, but be sure thou meetest me in the morning at this place.' ",1246,1333
13,"The king's son followed what the raven told him and that night he had meat of each meat, and drink of each drink, warm water for his feet, and a soft bed to lie in. ",1333,1498
14,"Thus it happened the next day, and the next, but on the fourth meeting, instead of meeting the raven, in his place the king's son found waiting for him the handsomest youth that ever was seen, with a bundle in his hand. ",1498,1718
15,'Is there a raven hereabouts?' ,1718,1749
16,"asked the king's son, and the youth answered: 'I am that raven, and I was delivered by thee from the spells that bound me, and in reward thou wilt get this bundle. ",1749,1913
17,"Go back by the road thou camest, and lie as before, a night in each house, but be careful not to unloose the bundle till thou art in the place wherein thou wouldst most wish to dwell.' ",1913,2098
18,"Then the king's son set out, and thus it happened as it had happened before, till he entered a thick wood near his father's house. ",2098,2229
19,He had walked a long way and suddenly the bundle seemed to grow heavier; ,2229,2302
20," first he put it down under a tree, and next he thought he would look at it. ",2301,2378
21,"The string was easy to untie, and the king's son soon unfastened the bundle. ",2378,2455
22,What was it he saw there? ,2455,2481
23,"Why, a great castle with an orchard all about it, and in the orchard fruit and flowers and birds of very kind. ",2481,2592
24,"It was all ready for him to dwell in, but instead of being in the midst of the forest, he did wish he had left the bundle unloosed till he had reached the green valley close to his father's palace. ",2592,2790
25,"Well, it was no use wishing, and with a sigh he glanced up, and beheld a huge giant coming towards him. ",2790,2894
26,"'Bad is the place where thou hast built thy house, king's son,' said the giant. ",2894,2974
27,'True; ,2974,2981
28," it is not here that I wish to be,' answered the king's son. ",2980,3041
29,'What reward wilt thou give me if I put it back in the bundle?' ,3041,3105
30,asked the giant. ,3105,3122
31,'What reward dost thou ask?' ,3122,3151
32,answered the king's son. ,3016,3041
33,"'The first boy thou hast when he is seven years old,' said the giant. ",3176,3246
34,"'If I have a boy thou shalt get him,' answered the king's son, and as he spoke the castle and the orchard were tied up in the bundle again. ",3246,3386
35,"'Now take thy road, and I will take mine,' said the giant. ",3386,3445
36,"'And if thou forgettest thy promise, I will remember it.' ",3445,3503
37,"Light of heart the king's son went on his road, till he came to the green valley near his father's palace. ",3503,3610
38,"Slowly he unloosed the bundle, fearing lest he should find nothing but a heap of stones or rags. ",3610,3707
39,But no! ,3707,3715
40,"all was as it had been before, and as he opened the castle door there stood within the most beautiful maiden that ever was seen. ",3715,3844
41,"'Enter, king's son,' said she, 'all is ready, and we will be married at once,' and so they were. ",3844,3941
42,"The maiden proved a good wife, and the king's son, now himself a king, was so happy that he forgot all about the giant. ",3941,4061
43,"Seven years and a day had gone by, when one morning, while standing on the ramparts, he beheld the giant striding towards the castle. ",4061,4195
44,"Then he remembered his promise, and remembered, too, that he had told the queen nothing about it. ",4195,4293
45,"Now he must tell her, and perhaps she might help him in his trouble. ",4293,4362
46,"The queen listened in silence to his tale, and after he had finished, she only said: 'Leave the matter between me and the giant,' and as she spoke, the giant entered the hall and stood before them. ",4362,4560
47,"'Bring out your son,' cried he to the king, 'as you promised me seven years and a day since.' ",4560,4654
48,"The king glanced at his wife, who nodded, so he answered: 'Let his mother first put him in order,' and the queen left the hall, and took the cook's son and dressed him in the prince's clothes, and led him up to the giant, who held his hand, and together they went out along the road. ",4654,4938
49,They had not walked far when the giant stopped and stretched out a stick to the boy. ,4938,5023
50,"'If your father had that stick, what would he do with it?' ",5023,5082
51,asked he. ,5082,5092
52,"'If my father had that stick, he would beat the dogs and cats that steal the king's meat,' replied the boy. ",5092,5200
53,'Thou art the cook's son!' ,5200,5227
54,cried the giant. ,5227,5244
55,'Go home to thy mother';,5244,5268
56, and turning his back he strode straight to the castle. ,5268,5324
57,"'If you seek to trick me this time, the highest stone will soon be the lowest,' said he, and the king and queen trembled, but they could not bear to give up their boy. ",5324,5492
58,"'The butler's son is the same age as ours,' whispered the queen; ",5492,5557
59," 'he will not know the difference,' and she took the child and dressed him in the prince's clothes, and the giant let him away along the road. ",5556,5699
60,"Before they had gone far he stopped, and held out a stick. ",5699,5758
61,"'If thy father had that rod, what would he do with it?' ",5758,5814
62,asked the giant. ,3105,3122
63,"'He would beat the dogs and cats that break the king's glasses,' answered the boy. ",5831,5914
64,'Thou art the son of the butler!' ,5914,5948
65,cried the giant. ,5227,5244
66,'Go home to thy mother';,5244,5268
67, and turning round he strode back angrily to the castle. ,5989,6046
68,"'Bring out thy son at once,' roared he, 'or the stone that is highest will be lowest,' and this time the real prince was brought. ",6046,6176
69,"But though his parents wept bitterly and fancied the child was suffering all kinds of dreadful things, the giant treated him like his own son, though he never allowed him to see his daughters. ",6176,6369
70,"The boy grew to be a big boy, and one day the giant told him that he would have to amuse himself alone for many hours, as he had a journey to make. ",6369,6517
71,"So the boy wandered to the top of the castle, where he had never been before. ",6517,6595
72,"There he paused, for the sound of music broke upon his ears, and opening a door near him, he beheld a girl sitting by the window, holding a harp. ",6595,6741
73,"'Haste and begone, I see the giant close at hand,' she whispered hurriedly, 'but when he is asleep, return hither, for I would speak with thee.' ",6741,6886
74,"And the prince did as he was bid, and when midnight struck he crept back to the top of the castle. ",6886,6985
75,"'To-morrow,' said the girl, who was the giant's daughter, 'to-morrow thou wilt get the choice of my two sisters to marry, but thou must answer that thou wilt not take either, but only me. ",6985,7173
76,"This will anger him greatly, for he wishes to betroth me to the son of the king of the Green City, whom I like not at all.' ",7173,7297
77,"Then they parted, and on the morrow, as the girl had said, the giant called his three daughters to him, and likewise the young prince to whom he spoke. ",7297,7449
78,"'Now, O son of the king of Tethertown, the time has come for us to part. ",7449,7522
79,"Choose one of my two elder daughters to wife, and thou shalt take her to your father's house the day after the wedding.' ",7522,7643
80,"'Give me the youngest instead,' replied the youth, and the giant's face darkened as he heard him. ",7643,7741
81,"'Three things must thou do first,' said he. ",7741,7785
82,"'Say on, I will do them,' replied the prince, and the giant left the house, and bade him follow to the byre, where the cows were kept. ",7785,7920
83,"'For a hundred years no man has swept this byre,' said the giant, 'but if by nightfall, when I reach home, thou has not cleaned it so that a golden apple can roll through it from end to end, thy blood shall pay for it.' ",7920,8140
84,"All day long the youth toiled, but he might as well have tried to empty the ocean. ",8140,8223
85,"At length, when he was so tired he could hardly move, the giant's youngest daughter stood in the doorway. ",8223,8329
86,"'Lay down thy weariness,' said she, and the king's son, thinking he could only die once, sank on the floor at her bidding, and fell sound asleep. ",8329,8475
87,"When he woke the girl had disappeared, and the byre was so clean that a golden apple could roll from end to end of it. ",8475,8594
88,"He jumped up in surprise, and at that moment in came the giant. ",8594,8658
89,"'Hast thou cleaned the byre, king's son?' ",8658,8700
90,asked he. ,5082,5092
91,"'I have cleaned it,' answered he. ",8710,8744
92,"'Well, since thou wert so active to-day, to-morrow thou wilt thatch this byre with a feather from every different bird, or else thy blood shall pay for it,' and he went out. ",8744,8918
93,"Before the sun was up, the youth took his bow and his quiver and set off to kill the birds. ",8918,9010
94,"Off to the moor he went, but never a bird was to be seen that day. ",9010,9077
95,At last he got so tired with running to and fro that he gave up heart. ,9077,9148
96,"'There is but one death I can die,' thought he. ",9148,9196
97,Then at midday came the giant's daughter. ,9196,9238
98,"'Thou art tired, king's son?' ",9238,9268
99,asked she. ,9268,9279
100,"'I am,' answered he; ",9279,9300
101," 'all these hours have I wandered, and there fell but these two blackbirds, both of one colour.' ",9299,9396
102,"'Lay down thy weariness on the grass,' said she, and he did as she bade him, and fell fast asleep. ",9396,9495
103,"When he woke the girl had disappeared, and he got up, and returned to the byre. ",9495,9575
104,"As he drew near, he rubbed his eyes hard, thinking he was dreaming, for there it was, beautifully thatched, just as the giant had wished. ",9575,9713
105,At the door of the house he met the giant. ,9713,9756
106,"'Hast thou thatched the byre, king's son?' ",9756,9799
107,'I have thatched it.' ,9799,9821
108,"'Well, since thou hast been so active to-day, I have something else for thee! ",9821,9899
109,Beside the loch thou seest over yonder there grows a fir tree. ,9899,9962
110,"On the top of the fir tree is a magpie's nest, and in the nest are five eggs. ",9962,10040
111,"Thou wilt bring me those eggs for breakfast, and if one is cracked or broken, thy blood shall pay for it.' ",10040,10147
112,"Before it was light next day, the king's son jumped out of bed and ran down to the loch. ",10147,10236
113,"The tree was not hard to find, for the rising sun shone red on the trunk, which was five hundred feet from the ground to its first branch. ",10236,10375
114,"Time after time he walked round it, trying to find some knots, however small, where he could put his feet, but the bark was quite smooth, and he soon saw that if he was to reach the top at all, it must be by climbing up with his knees like a sailor. ",10375,10625
115,"But then he was a king's son and not a sailor, which made all the difference. ",10625,10703
116,"However, it was no use standing there staring at the fir, at least he must try to do his best, and try he did till his hands and knees were sore, for as soon as he had struggled up a few feet, he slid back again. ",10703,10916
117,"Once he climbed a little higher than before, and hope rose in his heart, then down he came with such force that his hands and knees smarted worse than ever. ",10916,11073
118,"'This is no time for stopping,' said the voice of the giant's daughter, as he leant against the trunk to recover his breath. ",11073,11198
119,'Alas! ,11198,11205
120,"I am no sooner up than down,' answered he. ",11205,11248
121,"'Try once more,' said she, and she laid a finger against the tree and bade him put his foot on it. ",11248,11347
122,"Then she placed another finger a little higher up, and so on till he reached the top, where the magpie had built her nest. ",11347,11470
123,"'Make haste now with the nest,' she cried, 'for my father's breath is burning my back,' and down he scrambled as fast as he could, but the girl's little finger had caught in a branch at the top, and she was obliged to leave it there. ",11470,11704
124,"But she was too busy to pay heed to this, for the sun was getting high over the hills. ",11704,11791
125,"'Listen to me,' she said. ",11791,11817
126,"'This night my two sisters and I will be dressed in the same garments, and you will not know me. ",11817,11914
127,"But when my father says 'Go to thy wife, king's son,' come to the one whose right hand has no little finger.' ",11914,12024
128,"So he went and gave the eggs to the giant, who nodded his head. ",12024,12088
129,"'Make ready for thy marriage,' cried he, 'for the wedding shall take place this very night, and I will summon thy bride to greet thee.' ",12088,12224
130,"Then his three daughters were sent for, and they all entered dressed in green silk of the same fashion, and with golden circlets round their heads. ",12224,12372
131,The king's son looked from one to another. ,12372,12415
132,Which was the youngest? ,12415,12439
133,"Suddenly his eyes fell on the hand of the middle one, and there was no little finger. ",12439,12525
134,"'Thou hast aimed well this time too,' said the giant, as the king's son laid his hand on her shoulder, 'but perhaps we may meet some other way';",12525,12669
135," and though he pretended to laugh, the bride saw a gleam in his eye which warned her of danger. ",12669,12765
136,"The wedding took place that very night, and the hall was filled with giants and gentlemen, and they danced till the house shook from top to bottom. ",12765,12913
137,"At last everyone grew tired, and the guests went away, and the king's son and his bride were left alone. ",12913,13018
138,"'If we stay here till dawn my father will kill thee,' she whispered, 'but thou art my husband and I will save thee, as I did before,' and she cut an apple into nine pieces, and put two pieces at the head of the bed, and two pieces at the foot, and two pieces at the door of the kitchen, and two at the big door, and one outside the house. ",13018,13357
139,"And when this was done, and she heard the giant snoring, she and the king's son crept out softly and stole across to the stable, where she led out the blue-grey mare and jumped on its back, and her husband mounted behind her. ",13357,13583
140,"Not long after, the giant awoke. ",13583,13616
141,'Are you asleep?' ,13616,13634
142,asked he. ,5082,5092
143,"'Not yet,' answered the apple at the head of the bed, and the giant turned over, and soon was snoring as loudly as before. ",13644,13767
144,By and bye he called again. ,13767,13795
145,'Are you asleep?' ,13616,13634
146,"'Not yet,' said the apple at the foot of the bed, and the giant was satisfied. ",13813,13892
147,"After a while, he called a third time, 'Are you asleep?' ",13892,13949
148,"'Not yet,' replied the apple in the kitchen, but when in a few minutes, he put the question for the fourth time and received an answer from the apple outside the house door, he guessed what had happened, and ran to the room to look for himself. ",13949,14194
149,The bed was cold and empty! ,14194,14222
150,"'My father's breath is burning my back,' cried the girl, 'put thy hand into the ear of the mare, and whatever thou findest there, throw it behind thee.' ",14222,14375
151,"And in the mare's ear there was a twig of sloe tree, and as he threw it behind him there sprung up twenty miles of thornwood so thick that scarce a weasel could go through it. ",14375,14551
152,"And the giant, who was striding headlong forwards, got caught in it, and it pulled his hair and beard. ",14551,14654
153,"'This is one of my daughter's tricks,' he said to himself, 'but if I had my big axe and my wood-knife, I would not be long making a way through this,' and off he went home and brought back the axe and the wood-knife. ",14654,14871
154,"It took him but a short time to cut a road through the blackthorn, and then he laid the axe and the knife under a tree. ",14871,14991
155,"'I will leave them there till I return,' he murmured to himself, but a hoodie crow, which was sitting on a branch above, heard him. ",14991,15123
156,"'If thou leavest them,' said the hoodie, 'we will steal them.' ",15123,15186
157,"'You will,' answered the giant, 'and I must take them home.' ",15186,15247
158,"So he took them home, and started afresh on his journey. ",15247,15304
159,"'My father's breath is burning my back,' cried the girl at midday. ",15304,15371
160,"'Put thy finger in the mare's ear and throw behind thee whatever thou findest in it,' and the king's son found a splinter of grey stone, and threw it behind him, and in a twinkling twenty miles of solid rock lay between them and the giant. ",15371,15611
161,"'My daughter's tricks are the hardest things that ever met me,' said the giant, 'but if I had my lever and my crowbar, I would not be long in making my way through this rock also,' but as he had got them, he had to go home and fetch them. ",15611,15850
162,Then it took him but a short time to hew his way through the rock. ,15850,15917
163,"'I will leave the tools here,' he murmured aloud when he had finished. ",15917,15988
164,"'If thou leavest them, we will steal them,' said a hoodie who was perched on a stone above him, and the giant answered: 'Steal them if thou wilt; ",15988,16134
165, there is no time to go back.' ,16133,16164
166,"'My father's breath is burning my back,' cried the girl; ",16164,16221
167," 'look in the mare's ear, king's son, or we are lost,' and he looked, and found a tiny bladder full of water, which he threw behind him, and it became a great lock. ",16220,16385
168,"And the giant, who was striding on so fast, could not stop himself, and he walked right into the middle and was drowned. ",16385,16506
169,"The blue-grey mare galloped on like the wind, and the next day the king's son came in sight of his father's house. ",16506,16621
170,"'Get down and go in,' said the bride, 'and tell them that thou hast married me. ",16621,16701
171,"But take heed that neither man nor beast kiss thee, for then thou wilt cease to remember me at all.' ",16701,16802
172,"'I will do thy bidding,' answered he, and left her at the gate. ",16802,16866
173,"All who met him bade him welcome, and he charged his father and mother not to kiss him, but as he greeted them his old greyhound leapt on his neck, and kissed him on the mouth. ",16866,17043
174,And after that he did not remember the giant's daughter. ,17043,17100
175,"All that day she sat on a well which was near the gate, waiting, waiting, but the king's son never came. ",17100,17205
176,"In the darkness she climbed up into an oak tree that shadowed the well, and there she lay all night, waiting, waiting. ",17205,17324
177,"On the morrow, at midday, the wife of a shoemaker who dwelt near the well went to draw water for her husband to drink, and she saw the shadow of the girl in the tree, and thought it was her own shadow. ",17324,17526
178,"'How handsome I am, to be sure,' said she, gazing into the well, and as she stopped to behold herself better, the jug struck against the stones and broke in pieces, and she was forced to return to her husband without the water, and this angered him. ",17526,17776
179,"'Thou hast turned crazy,' said he in wrath. ",17776,17820
180,"'Go thou, my daughter, and fetch me a drink,' and the girl went, and the same thing befell her as had befallen her mother. ",17820,17943
181,'Where is the water?' ,17943,17965
182,"asked the shoemaker, when she came back, and as she held nothing save the handle of the jug he went to the well himself. ",17965,18086
183,"He too saw the reflection of the woman in the tree, but looked up to discover whence it came, and there above him sat the most beautiful woman in the world. ",18086,18243
184,"'Come down,' he said, 'for a while thou canst stay in my house,' and glad enough the girl was to come. ",18243,18346
185,"Now the king of the country was about to marry, and the young men about the court thronged the shoemaker's shop to buy fine shoes to wear at the wedding. ",18346,18500
186,"'Thou hast a pretty daughter,' said they when they beheld the girl sitting at work. ",18500,18584
187,"'Pretty she is,' answered the shoemaker, 'but no daughter of mine.' ",18584,18652
188,"'I would give a hundred pounds to marry her,' said one. ",18652,18708
189,"'And I,' 'And I,' cried the others. ",18708,18744
190,"'That is no business of mine,' answered the shoemaker, and the young men bade him ask her if she would choose one of them for a husband, and to tell them on the morrow. ",18744,18913
191,"Then the shoemaker asked her, and the girl said that she would marry the one who would bring his purse with him. ",18913,19026
192,"So the shoemaker hurried to the youth who had first spoken, and he came back, and after giving the shoemaker a hundred pounds for his news, he sought the girl, who was waiting for him. ",19026,19211
193,'Is it thou?' ,19211,19225
194,inquired she. ,19225,19239
195,"'I am thirsty, give me a drink from the well that is yonder.' ",19239,19301
196,"And he poured out the water, but he could not move from the place where he was; ",19301,19381
197, and there he stayed till many hours had passed by. ,19380,19432
198,"'Take away that foolish boy,' cried the girl to the shoemaker at last, 'I am tired of him,' and then suddenly he was able to walk, and betook himself to his home, but he did not tell the others what had happened to him. ",19432,19652
199,"Next day there arrived one of the other young men, and in the evening, when the shoemaker had gone out and they were alone, she said to him, 'See if the latch is on the door.' ",19652,19828
200,"The young man hastened to do her bidding, but as soon as he touched the latch, his fingers stuck to it, and there he had to stay for many hours, till the shoemaker came back, and the girl let him go. ",19828,20028
201,"Hanging his head, he went home, but he told no one what had befallen him. ",20028,20102
202,"Then was the turn of the third man, and his foot remained fastened to the floor, till the girl unloosed it. ",20102,20210
203,"And thankfully, he ran off, and was not seen looking behind him. ",20210,20275
204,"'Take the purse of gold,' said the girl to the shoemaker, 'I have no need of it, and it will better thee.' ",20275,20382
205,And the shoemaker took it and told the girl he must carry the shoes for the wedding up to the castle. ,20382,20484
206,"'I would fain get a sight of the king's son before he marries,' sighed she. ",20484,20560
207,"'Come with me, then,' answered he; ",20560,20595
208," 'the servants are all my friends, and they will let you stand in the passage down which the king's son will pass, and all the company too.' ",20594,20735
209,"Up they went to the castle, and when the young men saw the girl standing there, they led her into the hall where the banquet was laid out and poured her out some wine. ",20735,20903
210,"She was just raising the glass to drink when a flame went up out of it, and out of the flame sprang two pigeons, one of gold and one of silver. ",20903,21047
211,"They flew round and round the head of the girl, when three grains of barley fell on the floor, and the silver pigeon dived down, and swallowed them. ",21047,21196
212,"'If thou hadst remembered how I cleaned the byre, thou wouldst have given me my share,' cooed the golden pigeon, and as he spoke three more grains fell, and the silver pigeon ate them as before. ",21196,21391
213,"'If thou hadst remembered how I thatched the byre, thou wouldst have given me my share,' cooed the golden pigeon again; ",21391,21511
214," and as he spoke three more grains fell, and for the third time they were eaten by the silver pigeon. ",21510,21612
215,"'If thou hadst remembered how I got the magpie's nest, thou wouldst have given me my share,' cooed the golden pigeon. ",21612,21730
216,"Then the king's son understood that they had come to remind him of what he had forgotten, and his lost memory came back, and he knew his wife, and kissed her. ",21730,21889
217,"But as the preparations had been made, it seemed a pity to waste them, so they were married a second time, and sat down to the wedding feast.",21889,22031
