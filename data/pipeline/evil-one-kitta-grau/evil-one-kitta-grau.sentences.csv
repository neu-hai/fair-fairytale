0,"One day the devil met Kitta Grau: ""Where have you been, old man?"" ",0,66
1,"asked Kitta Grau, for she recognized him. ",66,108
2,"""Well,"" said the evil one, ""I have been out on the farm where the newly wedded couple live. ",108,200
3,This is the third time I have tried to sow dissension between them. ,200,268
4,"But they think so much of each other that it is a sheer impossibility."" ",268,340
5,"""You talk like a real stupid. ",340,370
6,"That is something I could bring about the very first time I went there,"" said Kitta Grau. ",370,460
7,"""If you can do that, you shall have a splendid pair of shoes,"" was the evil one's reply. ",460,549
8,"""Mind you keep your word!"" ",549,576
9,"said Kitta, and turned toward the farm. ",576,616
10,"There the woman was home alone, for her husband had gone to the forest. ",616,688
11,"Kitta said to the young wife: ""You really have a splendid husband."" ",688,756
12,"""And that is the truth,"" the woman replied, ""for he grants my every wish before it is spoken."" ",756,851
13,"""But take my word for it,"" said Kitta, ""there is still a bit of deceit in him. ",851,930
14,He has a pair of long hairs under his chin. ,930,974
15,"If you could get at them with a razor, and cut them off while he is asleep, then he would be altogether without malice."" ",974,1095
16,"""Well,"" said the woman, ""if that will help, I will be sure to keep an eye open after dinner and attend to it, for then he always takes a little noon-day nap."" ",1095,1254
17,Then Kitta Grau went out into the forest to the husband and bade him good-day. ,1254,1333
18,"""You really have a very good wife,"" said Kitta. ",1333,1381
19,"""She could not be better,"" replied the husband. ",1381,1429
20,"""Well you might be mistaken for all that,"" said Kitta. ",1429,1484
21,"""When you come home, be on your guard. ",1484,1523
22,"When you go to take your noon-day nap, she has in mind to cut your throat. ",1523,1598
23,"So be sure not to go to sleep."" ",1598,1630
24,The husband did not think much of the matter. ,1630,1676
25,"Still, he thanked Kitta Grau for her trouble. ",1676,1722
26,"Then he went home and ate his dinner, laid down and pretended to fall asleep at once. ",1722,1808
27,"Then his wife went to his shaving-kit, took out his razor, went softly up to him and took hold of his chin with her hand. ",1808,1930
28,Up flew the man. ,1930,1947
29,"""Do you want to murder me?"" ",1947,1975
30,"he cried, and gave his wife such a thump that she measured her full length on the floor. ",1975,2064
31,And from that day forward there was no peace in the house. ,2064,2123
32,Now Kitta Grau was to receive her reward from the evil one. ,2123,2183
33,"But he was so afraid of her that he did not venture to give her the shoes until he stood on one side of a stream, while she stood on the other, and then he passed them over to her on a long pole. ",2183,2379
34,"""You are ever so much worse than I am,"" he told Kitta Grau. ",2379,2439
35,The black man had made a bargain with a merchant. ,2439,2489
36,He had promised him that all goods which he might buy he should sell again within three weeks' time at a handsome profit. ,2489,2611
37,"But, if he had prospered, after seven years had passed he was to be the devil's own. ",2611,2696
38,"And he did prosper, for no matter what manner of old trash the merchant bought, and if it were no more than an old worn-out fur coat, he was always able to sell it again, and always at a profit. ",2696,2891
39,Kitta Grau came into his shop and showed him the handsome shoes the evil one had given her. ,2891,2983
40,"So the merchant said: ""May heaven keep me from him! ",2983,3035
41,He will surely fetch me when the time comes. ,3035,3080
42,"I have made a pact with him and I have been unable to buy anything without selling it again in three weeks' time."" ",3080,3195
43,"Then Kitta Grau said: ""Buy me, for I am sure no one will buy me from you!"" ",3195,3270
44,And that is what the merchant did. ,3270,3305
45,"He bought Kitta, had her disrobe and cover herself with tar, and roll in a pile of feathers. ",3305,3398
46,Then he put her in a glass cage as though she were a bird. ,3398,3457
47,"Now the first week went by, and the second week went by, and the third week went by, and no one appeared who wanted to buy the curious bird. ",3457,3598
48,"And then, in due time, came the evil one, and wanted to fetch his merchant. ",3598,3674
49,"""Have patience,"" said the merchant, ""I still have something I have bought, but have not been able to sell again in three weeks' time."" ",3674,3809
50,"""That is something I'd like to see,"" said the black man. ",3809,3866
51,"Then the merchant showed him Kitta Grau, sitting in her glass cage. ",3866,3934
52,"But no sooner had the evil one seen the handsome bird than he cried: ""Oh, I see! ",3934,4015
53,It is you Kitta Grau! ,4015,4037
54,"No one who knows you would buy you!"" ",4037,4074
55,And with that he hurried on his way. ,4074,4111
