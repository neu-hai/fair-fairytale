0,Some twenty miles east of Gingdschou lies the Lake of the Maidens. ,0,67
1,It is several miles square and surrounded on all sides by thick green thickets and tall forests. ,67,164
2,Its waters are clear and dark-blue. ,164,200
3,Often all kinds of wondrous creatures show themselves in the lake. ,200,267
4,The people of the vicinity have erected a temple there for the Dragon Princess. ,267,347
5,And in times of drought all make pilgrimage there to offer up prayers. ,347,418
6,"West of Gingdschou, two hundred miles away, is another lake, whose god is named Tschauna, and who performs many miracles. ",418,540
7,During the time of the Tang dynasty there lived in Gingdschou a mandarin by name of Dschou Bau. ,540,636
8,"While he was in office it chanced that in the fifth month clouds suddenly arose in the sky, piling themselves up like mountains, among which wriggled dragons and serpents; ",636,808
9, they rolled up and down between the two seas. ,807,854
10,"Tempest and rain, thunder and lightning arose so that houses fell to pieces, trees were torn up by the roots, and much damage was done the crops. ",854,1000
11,"Dschou Bau took the blame upon himself, and prayed to the heavens that his people might be pardoned. ",1000,1101
12,On the fifth day of the sixth month he sat in his hall of audience and gave judgment; ,1101,1187
13, and suddenly he felt quite weary and sleepy. ,1186,1232
14,He took off his hat and laid down on the cushions. ,1232,1283
15,"No sooner had he closed his eyes than he saw a warrior in helmet and armor, with a halberd in his hand, standing on the steps leading to the hall, who announced: ""A lady is waiting outside who wishes to enter!"" ",1283,1494
16,"Dschou Bau asked him: ""Who are you?"" ",1494,1531
17,"The answer was: ""I am your door-keeper. ",1531,1571
18,"In the invisible world I already have been performing this duty for many years."" ",1571,1652
19,"Meanwhile two figures clad in green came up the steps, knelt before him and said: ""Our mistress has come to visit you!"" ",1652,1772
20,Dschou Bau rose. ,1772,1789
21,"He beheld lovely clouds, from which fell a fine rain, and strange fragrances enchanted him. ",1789,1881
22,"Suddenly he saw a lady clad in a simple gown, but of surpassing beauty, float down from on high, with a retinue of many female servants. ",1881,2018
23,"These were all neat and clean in appearance, and waited upon the lady as though she were a princess. ",2018,2119
24,When the latter entered the hall she raised her arms in greeting. ,2119,2185
25,Dschou Bau came forward to meet her and invited her to be seated. ,2185,2251
26,"From all sides bright-colored clouds came floating in, and the courtyard was filled with a purple ether. ",2251,2356
27,Dschou Bau had wine and food brought and entertained them all in the most splendid way. ,2356,2444
28,"But the goddess sat staring straight before her with wrinkled brows, and seemed to feel very sad. ",2444,2542
29,"Then she rose and said with a blush: ""I have been living in this neighborhood for many years. ",2542,2636
30,"A wrong which has been done me, permits me to pass the bounds of what is fitting, and encourages me to ask a favor of you. ",2636,2759
31,"Yet I do not know whether you wish to save me!"" ",2759,2807
32,"""May I hear what it is all about,"" answered Dschou Bau. ",2807,2863
33,"""If I can help you, I will be glad to place myself at your disposal."" ",2863,2933
34,"The goddess said: ""For hundreds of years my family has been living in the depth of the Eastern Sea. ",2933,3033
35,But we were unfortunate in that our treasures excited the jealousy of men. ,3033,3108
36,The ancestor of Pi-Lo nearly destroyed our entire clan by fire. ,3108,3172
37,My ancestors had to fly and hide themselves. ,3172,3217
38,"And not long ago, our enemy Pi-Lo himself wanted to deliver an imperial letter in the cave of the Sea of Dungting. ",3217,3332
39,"Under the pretext of begging for pearls and treasures, he wished to enter the dragon-castle and destroy our family. ",3332,3448
40,"Fortunately a wise man saw through his treacherous purpose, and Lo-Dsi-Tschun and his brothers were sent in his stead. ",3448,3567
41,Yet my people did not feel safe from future attacks. ,3567,3620
42,For this reason they withdrew to the distant West. ,3620,3671
43,My father has done much good to mankind and hence is highly honored there. ,3671,3746
44,I am his ninth daughter. ,3746,3771
45,When I was sixteen I was wedded to the youngest son of the Rock-Dragon. ,3771,3843
46,"But my good husband had a fiery temper, which often caused him to offend against the laws of courtesy, and in less than a year's time the punishment of heaven was his portion. ",3843,4019
47,I was left alone and returned to the home of my parents. ,4019,4076
48,My father wished me to marry again; ,4076,4112
49," but I had promised to remain true to the memory of my husband, and made a vow not to comply with my father's wish. ",4111,4227
50,"My parents grew angry, and I was obliged to retire to this place in view of their anger. ",4227,4316
51,That was three years ago. ,4316,4342
52,"Who could imagine that the contemptible dragon Tschauna, who was seeking a wife for his youngest brother, would try to force the wedding-gift upon me? ",4342,4493
53,I refused to accept it; ,4493,4517
54," but Tschauna knew how to gain his point with my father, and was determined to carry out his intention. ",4516,4620
55,"My father, regardless of my wishes, promised me to him. ",4620,4676
56,And then the dragon Tschauna appeared with his youngest brother and wanted to carry me off by sheer force of arms. ,4676,4791
57,"I encountered him with fifty faithful followers, and we fought on the meadow before the city. ",4791,4885
58,"We were defeated, and I am more than ever afraid that Tschauna will attempt to drag me off. ",4885,4977
59,So I have plucked up courage to beg you to lend me your mercenaries so that I may beat off my foes and remain as I am. ,4977,5096
60,"If you will help me I will be grateful to you till the end of my days."" ",5096,5168
61,"Dschou Bau answered: ""You come from a noble family. ",5168,5220
62,"Have you no kinsfolk who will hasten to help you in your need, that you are compelled to turn to a mortal man?"" ",5220,5332
63,"""It is true that my kinsfolk are far-famed and numerous. ",5332,5389
64,"If I were to send out letters and they came to my aid, they would rub out that scaly scoundrel Tschauna as one might rub garlic. ",5389,5518
65,But my deceased husband offended the high heavens and he has not yet been pardoned. ,5518,5602
66,"And my parents' will, too, is opposed to mine, so that I dare not call upon my kinsfolk for help. ",5602,5700
67,"You will understand my need."" ",5700,5730
68,"Then Dschou Bau promised to help her, and the princess thanked him and departed. ",5730,5811
69,"When he awoke, he sighed long thinking over his strange experience. ",5811,5879
70,And the following day he sent off fifteen hundred soldiers to stand guard by the Lake of the Maidens. ,5879,5981
71,On the seventh day of the sixth month Dschou Bau rose early. ,5981,6042
72,"Darkness still lay before the windows, yet it seemed to him as though he could glimpse a man before the curtain. ",6042,6155
73,He asked who it might be. ,6155,6181
74,"The man said: ""I am the princess's adviser. ",6181,6225
75,Yesterday you were kind enough to send soldiers to aid us in our distress. ,6225,6300
76,"But they were all living men, and such cannot fight against invisible spirits. ",6300,6379
77,"You will have to send us soldiers of yours who have died, if you wish to aid us."" ",6379,6461
78,"Dschou Bau reflected for a time, and then it occurred to him that of course such must be the case. ",6461,6560
79,So he had his field-secretary examine the roster to see how many of his soldiers had fallen in battle. ,6560,6663
80,And the latter counted up to some two thousand foot-soldiers and five-hundred horsemen. ,6663,6751
81,"Dschou Bau appointed his deceased officer Mong Yuan as their leader, and wrote his commands on a paper which he burned, in order thus to place them at the princess's disposal. ",6751,6927
82,The living soldiers he recalled. ,6927,6960
83,"When they were being reviewed in the courtyard after their return, a soldier suddenly fell unconscious. ",6960,7064
84,It was not until early the following morning that he came to his senses again. ,7064,7143
85,"He was questioned and replied: ""I saw a man clad in red who approached me and said: 'Our princess is grateful for the aid your master has so kindly given her. ",7143,7302
86,Yet she still has a request to make and has asked me to call you.' ,7302,7369
87,I followed him to the temple. ,7369,7399
88,"The princess bade me come forward and said to me: 'I thank your master from my heart for sending me the ghost soldiers, but Mong Yuan, their leader is incapable. ",7399,7561
89,"Yesterday the robbers came with three thousand men, and Mong Yuan was beaten by them. ",7561,7647
90,"When you return and again see your master, say that I earnestly beg him to send me a good general. ",7647,7746
91,Perhaps that will save me in my need.' ,7746,7785
92,"Then she had me led back again and I regained consciousness."" ",7785,7847
93,"When Dschou Bau had heard these words, which seemed to fit strangely well with what he had dreamed, he thought he would try to see if this were really the case. ",7847,8008
94,Therefore he chose his victorious general Dschong Tschong-Fu to take the place of Mong Yuan. ,8008,8101
95,"That evening he burned incense, offered wine and handed over to the princess this captain's soul. ",8101,8199
96,On the twenty-sixth of the month news came from the general's camp that he had suddenly died at midnight on the thirteenth. ,8199,8323
97,"Dschou Bau was frightened, and sent a man to bring him a report. ",8323,8388
98,"The latter informed him that the general's heart had hardly ceased to beat, and that, in spite of the hot summer weather, his body was free from any trace of decay. ",8388,8553
99,So the order was given not to bury him. ,8553,8593
100,"Then one night an icy, spectral wind arose, which whirled up sand and stones, broke trees and tore down houses. ",8593,8705
101,The standing corn in the fields was blown down. ,8705,8753
102,The storm lasted all day. ,8753,8779
103,"Finally, the crash of a terrific thunderbolt was heard, and then the skies cleared and the clouds scattered. ",8779,8888
104,"That very hour the dead general began to breathe painfully on his couch, and when his attendants came to him, he had returned to life again. ",8888,9029
105,"They questioned him and he told them: ""First I saw a man in a purple gown riding a black horse, who came up with a great retinue. ",9029,9159
106,He dismounted before the door. ,9159,9190
107,"In his hand he held a decree of appointment which he gave me, saying: 'Our princess begs you most respectfully to become her general. ",9190,9324
108,I hope that you will not refuse.' ,9324,9358
109,Then he brought forth gifts and heaped them up before the steps. ,9358,9423
110,"Jade-stones, brocades, and silken garments, saddles, horses, helmets and suits of mail-he heaped them all up in the courtyard. ",9423,9550
111,"I wished to decline, but this he would not allow, and urged me to enter his chariot with him. ",9550,9644
112,We drove a hundred miles and met a train of three-hundred armored horsemen who had ridden out to escort me. ,9644,9752
113,"They led me to a great city, and before the city a tent had been erected in which played a band of musicians. ",9752,9862
114,A high official welcomed me. ,9862,9891
115,When I entered the city the onlookers were crowded together like walls. ,9891,9963
116,Servants ran to and fro bearing orders. ,9963,10003
117,We passed through more than a dozen gates before we reached the princess. ,10003,10077
118,"There I was requested to dismount and change my clothes in order to enter the presence of the princess, for she wished to receive me as her guest. ",10077,10224
119,"But I thought this too great an honor and greeted her below, on the steps. ",10224,10299
120,"She, however, invited me to seat myself near her in the hall. ",10299,10361
121,"She sat upright in all her incomparable beauty, surrounded by female attendants adorned with the richest jewels. ",10361,10474
122,These plucked lute-strings and played flutes. ,10474,10520
123,"A throng of servitors stood about in golden girdles with purple tassels, ready to carry out her commands. ",10520,10626
124,Countless crowds were assembled before the palace. ,10626,10677
125,"Five or six visitors sat in a circle about the princess, and a general led me to my place. ",10677,10768
126,The princess said to me: 'I have begged you to come here in order to entrust the command of my army to you. ,10768,10876
127,If you will break the power of my foe I will reward you richly.' ,10876,10941
128,I promised to obey her. ,10941,10965
129,"Then wine was brought in, and the banquet was served to the sound of music. ",10965,11041
130,"While we were at table a messenger entered: 'The robber Tschauna has invaded our land with ten thousand footmen and horsemen, and is approaching our city by various roads. ",11041,11213
131,His way is marked by columns of fire and smoke!' ,11213,11262
132,The guests all grew pale with terror when they heard the news. ,11262,11325
133,And the princess said: 'This is the foe because of whom I have sought your aid. ,11325,11405
134,Save me in my hour of need!' ,11405,11434
135,"Then she gave me two chargers, a suit of golden armor, and the insignia of a commander-in-chief, and bowed to me. ",11434,11548
136,"I thanked her and went, called together the captains, had the army mustered and rode out before the city. ",11548,11654
137,At several decisive points I placed troops in ambush. ,11654,11708
138,"The enemy was already approaching in great force, careless and unconcerned, intoxicated by his former victories. ",11708,11821
139,"I sent out my most untrustworthy soldiers in advance, who allowed themselves to be beaten in order to lure him on. ",11821,11936
140,"Light-armed men then went out against him, and retreated in skirmish order. ",11936,12012
141,And thus he fell into my ambush. ,12012,12045
142,"Drums and kettledrums sounded together, the ring closed around them on all sides and the robber army suffered a grievous defeat. ",12045,12174
143,"The dead lay about like hemp-stalks, but little Tschauna succeeded in breaking through the circle. ",12174,12273
144,"I sent out the light horsemen after him, and they seized him before the tent of the enemy's commanding general. ",12273,12385
145,"Hastily I sent word to the princess, and she reviewed the prisoners before the palace. ",12385,12472
146,"All the people, high and low, streamed together, to acclaim her. ",12472,12537
147,Little Tschauna was about to be executed in the market place when a messenger came spurring up with a command from the princess's father to pardon him. ,12537,12689
148,The princess did not dare to disobey. ,12689,12727
149,So he was dismissed to his home after he had sworn to give up all thought of realizing his traitorous plans. ,12727,12836
150,I was loaded with benefits as a reward for my victory. ,12836,12891
151,"I was invested with an estate with three thousand peasants, and was given a palace, horses and wagons, all sorts of jewels, men-servants and women-servants, gardens and forests, banners and suits of mail. ",12891,13096
152,"And my subordinate officers, too, were duly rewarded. ",13096,13150
153,"On the following day a banquet was held, and the princess herself filled a goblet, sent it to me by one of her attendants, and said: 'Widowed early in life, I opposed the wishes of my stern father and fled to this spot. ",13150,13370
154,Here the infamous Tschauna harassed me and well-nigh put me to shame. ,13370,13440
155,"Had not your master's great kindness and your own courage come to my assistance, hard would have been my lot!' ",13440,13551
156,Then she began to thank me and her tears of emotion flowed like a stream. ,13551,13625
157,"I bowed and begged her to grant me leave of absence, so that I might look after my family. ",13625,13716
158,I was given a month's leave and the following day she dismissed me with a splendid retinue. ,13716,13808
159,Before the city a pavilion had been erected in which I drank the stirrup-cup. ,13808,13886
160,"Then I rode away and when I arrived before our own gate a thunder-peal crashed and I awoke."" ",13886,13979
161,"Thereupon the general wrote an account of what had happened to Dschou Bau, in which he conveyed the princess's thanks. ",13979,14098
162,"Then he paid no further heed to worldly matters, but set his house in order and turned it over to his wife and son. ",14098,14214
163,"When a month had passed, he died without any sign of illness. ",14214,14276
164,That same day one of his officers was out walking. ,14276,14327
165,"Suddenly he saw a heavy cloud of dust rising along the highway, while flags and banners darkened the sun. ",14327,14433
166,A thousand knights were escorting a man who sat his horse proudly and like a hero. ,14433,14516
167,"And when the officer looked at his face, it was the general Dschong Tschong-Fu. ",14516,14596
168,"Hastily he stepped to the edge of the road, in order to allow the cavalcade to pass, and watched it ride by. ",14596,14705
169,"The horsemen took the way to the Lake of the Maidens, where they disappeared.",14705,14783
