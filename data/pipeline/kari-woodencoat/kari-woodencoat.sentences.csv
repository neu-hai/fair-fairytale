0,"ONCE upon a time there was a king whose wife had died, but he had a daughter who was so good and so beautiful that no one could have been kinder or lovelier than she. ",0,167
1,"The king mourned a long time for the queen, because he had loved her greatly; ",167,245
2," but in the course of time he grew weary of his lonely life, and married again with the widow of another king, who also had a daughter; ",244,380
3, but one who was just as ugly and evil as the other was handsome and kind. ,379,454
4,"The step-mother and daughter were jealous of the king's daughter, because she was so handsome; ",454,549
5," yet so long as the king was at home, they did not dare harm her, for he was very fond of her. ",548,643
6,"But after a time, the king began to war against another king, and went out to battle. ",643,729
7,"Then the queen thought she now could do as she wished, and she let the king's daughter starve, and beat and pushed her about everywhere. ",729,866
8,"At last everything else was too good for her, and she had to herd the cows. ",866,942
9,"So she went out with the cows, and pastured them in the forest or on the hill. ",942,1021
10,"Food she had little or none, and she grew pale and thin, and was sad most of the time, and wept. ",1021,1118
11,"In the herd there was also a great blue bull, who always kept himself neat and clean, and often came to the king's daughter and let her scratch him. ",1118,1267
12,"Once, as she sat there and cried and was sad, he came to her again, and asked why she was so unhappy. ",1267,1369
13,She did not answer him but kept on weeping. ,1369,1413
14,"""Well, I know what your trouble is,"" said the bull, ""even though you will not tell me. ",1413,1500
15,"You are weeping because the queen is so unkind to you, and would gladly starve you to death. ",1500,1593
16,"But you need not worry about food, for in my left ear is a cloth and, if you will take it out and spread it, you can have as much as you want to eat."" ",1593,1744
17,"She did so, took out the cloth, laid it on the grass, and it was at once covered with the finest dishes one might desire: bread and mead and honey-cake. ",1744,1897
18,"Then she soon regained her strength, and grew so plump, and so rose and white complexioned that the queen and her daughter, who was as thin as a rail, turned green and yellow with envy. ",1897,2083
19,The queen could not understand how it was that her step-daughter came to look so well in spite of such poor fare. ,2083,2197
20,"So she told a maid to follow her to the forest, and watch and see how it came about; ",2197,2282
21, for she thought some of the servants secretly gave her food. ,2281,2343
22,"The maid followed her into the forest, and watched carefully, and saw how the step-daughter drew the cloth out of the blue bull's left ear, and spread it out, and how it covered itself with the finest dishes, and also how the king's daughter ate heartily. ",2343,2599
23,And the maid told the queen at home about it. ,2599,2645
24,"Now the king came home, and he had defeated the other king, against whom he had warred; ",2645,2733
25," and the whole castle was overjoyed, and none was more joyful than the king's daughter. ",2732,2820
26,"But the queen pretended to be ill, and gave the physician a great deal of money so that he should say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull's flesh to eat. ",2820,3002
27,"The king's daughter and others as well asked the physician whether nothing else would do, and pleaded for the bull; ",3002,3118
28," for all liked him, and said that there was not such another in the whole kingdom. ",3117,3200
29,"But no, he must be slaughtered, and he should be slaughtered, and there was no help for it. ",3200,3292
30,"When the king's daughter heard this, she felt sad, and went into the stable to the bull. ",3292,3381
31,"He stood and hung his head, and looked so mournful that she could not keep from weeping. ",3381,3470
32,"""Why do you weep?"" ",3470,3489
33,asked the bull. ,3489,3505
34,"Then she told him that the king had come home, and that the queen had pretended to be ill, and had forced the physician to say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull's flesh to eat, and that now he was to be slaughtered. ",3505,3751
35,"""Once she has done away with me, it will not be long before she does away with you,"" said the bull. ",3751,3851
36,"""But if it suits you, we will run away from here to-night."" ",3851,3911
37,"The king's daughter did say that it would be bad enough to leave her father, but that at the same time it would be worse to remain under the same roof with the queen, and so she promised the bull to go with him. ",3911,4123
38,"In the evening, while the rest were asleep, the king's daughter crept down to the bull in the stable. ",4123,4225
39,"He took her on his back, and ran off as quickly as ever he could. ",4225,4291
40,"And when the people rose the following morning, and wanted to slaughter the bull, he was gone; ",4291,4386
41," and when the king rose and asked for his daughter, she was gone as well. ",4385,4459
42,"The king sent out messengers on all sides, and had the church-bells rung for her, but no one had seen anything of her. ",4459,4578
43,"In the meantime the bull trotted through many lands with the king's daughter, and they came to a great copper forest, whose trees, leaves and flowers were all of copper. ",4578,4748
44,"But before they entered it, the bull said to the king's daughter: ""Now when we get into the forest you must be very careful not to touch so much as a single leaf, or else it is all up with you and with me; ",4748,4954
45," for a troll with three heads lives here, and the forest belongs to him."" ",4953,5027
46,"Yes, indeed, she would be careful, and not touch anything. ",5027,5086
47,"And she was very careful, and leaned to one side, and thrust aside the branches; ",5086,5167
48," but the forest was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through, and for all that she was so careful, she did tear off a leaf, and it remained in her hand. ",5166,5332
49,"""Alas, alas!"" ",5332,5346
50,cried the bull. ,5346,5362
51,"""What have you done! ",5362,5383
52,Now I must fight for my very life. ,5383,5418
53,"But see that you keep the leaf carefully!"" ",5418,5461
54,"Straightway they reached the end of the forest, and at once a troll with three heads came rushing up. ",5461,5563
55,"""Who has touched my forest?"" ",5563,5592
56,cried he. ,5592,5602
57,"""The forest is as much mine as yours!"" ",5602,5641
58,was the bull's reply. ,5641,5663
59,"""We'll see if it is!"" ",5663,5685
60,shouted the troll. ,5685,5704
61,"""That suits me!"" ",5704,5721
62,cried the bull. ,5346,5362
63,"Then they rushed at each other, and the bull gored and butted with might and main. ",5737,5820
64,"But the troll was just as strong, and it took all day before the bull gained the upper hand. ",5820,5913
65,"And then he had so many wounds, and was so weak that he could scarcely walk. ",5913,5990
66,So they had to halt for a whole day; ,5990,6027
67," but the bull told the queen's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll's girdle, and anoint him with the salve. ",6026,6159
68,"Thereupon he grew strong and well again, and they went on the next day. ",6159,6231
69,"Now they wandered for many, many days, and at last came to a silver forest, whose trees, branches, leaves, buds and all were of silver. ",6231,6367
70,"Before the bull entered the forest he said to the king's daughter: ""Now when we get into this forest, in heaven's name be careful! ",6367,6498
71,"You must touch nothing, and not even tear off so much as a single leaf, or else it is all up with you and me. ",6498,6608
72,"A troll with six heads lives here, and the forest belongs to him, and I will hardly be able to hold my own against him!"" ",6608,6729
73,"""Yes,"" said the king's daughter, ""indeed I will be careful, and not touch the least thing, just as you have told me."" ",6729,6847
74,"But when they entered the forest, it was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through. ",6847,6943
75,"She was as careful as she could be, and avoided the branches, and thrust them aside with her hands; ",6943,7043
76," but the branches struck her in the face each moment, and in spite of all her care a leaf did remain in her hand. ",7042,7156
77,"""Alas, alas!"" ",5332,5346
78,cried the bull. ,5346,5362
79,"""What have you done! ",5362,5383
80,"Now I must fight for my very life, for the troll with six heads is twice as strong as the first one; ",7207,7308
81," but see that you take care of the leaf and keep it carefully!"" ",7307,7371
82,At once the troll came rushing up. ,7371,7406
83,"""Who has touched my forest?"" ",5563,5592
84,cried he. ,5592,5602
85,"""The forest is as much mine as yours!"" ",5602,5641
86,cried the bull. ,5346,5362
87,"""Oho, we'll see if it is!"" ",7500,7527
88,cried the troll. ,7527,7544
89,"""That suits me!"" ",5704,5721
90,"said the bull, and rushed on the troll, gored him, and thrust his horns right through him. ",7561,7652
91,"But the troll was just as strong, and it took three whole days before the bull got the better of him. ",7652,7754
92,"After that he was so weak and feeble that he could scarcely move, and so full of wounds that his blood ran in streams. ",7754,7873
93,"Then he told the king's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll's girdle, and anoint him with the salve. ",7873,7999
94,"She did so, and he recovered again: yet they had to remain a time on the spot, until he was once more able to go on. ",7999,8116
95,At last they set out again; ,8116,8144
96," but the bull was still weak, and at first they went slowly. ",8143,8204
97,"The king's daughter wanted to spare him, and said she was young and quick on her feet, and could walk very well; ",8204,8317
98," but this he would not allow, and she had to sit on his back. ",8316,8378
99,"Thus they wandered for a long time, and through many lands, and the king's daughter had no idea where they might be going; ",8378,8501
100, but at length they came to a golden forest. ,8500,8545
101,"It was very beautiful, and the gold dripped down from it, for the trees, and branches and leaves and buds were all of purest gold. ",8545,8676
102,And here all went as it had in the copper and silver forests. ,8676,8738
103,"The bull told the king's daughter that in no case was she to touch anything, since a troll with nine heads lived here, to whom the forest belonged. ",8738,8886
104,"And he was much larger and stronger than the two others together, and he did not believe he could hold his own against him. ",8886,9010
105,"Yes, said she, she would be sure to pay attention and positively would not touch a thing. ",9010,9100
106,"But when they entered the forest, it was even thicker than the silver forest, and the further they went the worse it became. ",9100,9225
107,"The forest grew thicker and denser, and at last it seemed as though it would be impossible to push on at all. ",9225,9335
108,"She was much afraid of tearing off anything, and wound and twisted and bent herself in every direction, in order to avoid the branches, and thrust them aside with her hands. ",9335,9509
109,"But each moment they struck her in the face, so that she could not see where she was reaching, and before she had a chance to think, she held a golden apple in her hand. ",9509,9679
110,"Then she was terribly frightened, and began to cry, and wanted to throw it away. ",9679,9760
111,"But the bull told her to keep it, and hide it carefully, and consoled her as best he could. ",9760,9852
112,"Yet he thought that the battle would be a hard one, and was in doubt as to whether it would end well. ",9852,9954
113,"But now the troll with the nine heads came rushing up, and he was so frightful that the king's daughter could scarcely bear to look at him. ",9954,10094
114,"""Who has touched my forest?"" ",5563,5592
115,he shouted. ,10123,10135
116,"""The forest is as much mine as yours!"" ",5602,5641
117,cried the bull. ,5346,5362
118,"""We'll see if it is!"" ",5663,5685
119,cried the troll. ,7527,7544
120,"""That suits me!"" ",5704,5721
121,"said the bull, and with this they rushed on each other, so that it was a fearsome sight, and the king's daughter nearly fainted. ",10246,10375
122,The bull gored the troll through and through with his horns; ,10375,10436
123," but the troll was as strong as he, and as soon as the bull killed one of his heads, the others breathed fresh life into it, and it took a full week before the bull got the better of him. ",10435,10623
124,But then he was so wretched and so weak that he could not move a bit. ,10623,10693
125,His whole body was covered with wounds; ,10693,10733
126, and he could not even tell the king's daughter to take the horn of ointment from the troll's girdle and anoint him with the salve. ,10732,10864
127,"But she did so of her own accord, and then he recovered again. ",10864,10927
128,"Yet they had to stay where they were for three whole weeks, until he was able to go on again. ",10927,11021
129,At last they once more went slowly on their way; ,11021,11070
130," for the bull said they still had a little further to go, and they went over many great hills and through thick forests. ",11069,11190
131,After a time they came to a rock. ,11190,11224
132,"""Do you see anything?"" ",11224,11247
133,asked the bull. ,3489,3505
134,"""No, I see only the sky and the rock,"" said the king's daughter. ",11263,11328
135,"But when they went on up the hills were more level, so that they had a broader outlook. ",11328,11416
136,"""Do you see something now?"" ",11416,11444
137,asked the bull. ,3489,3505
138,"""Yes, I see a small castle, far, far in the distance,"" said the princess. ",11460,11534
139,"""And yet it is not so small,"" said the bull. ",11534,11579
140,"At length they came to a great mountain with a steep, rocky face. ",11579,11645
141,"""Do you see something now?"" ",11416,11444
142,asked the bull. ,3489,3505
143,"""Yes, now I see the castle close by, and it is much, much larger,"" said the king's daughter. ",11689,11782
144,"""That is where you must go!"" ",11782,11811
145,said the bull. ,3836,3851
146,"""Just below the castle is a pig-sty, and if you go into it you will find a wooden coat. ",11826,11914
147,"You must put it on, and go with it into the castle, and say your name is Kari Woodencoat, and ask for a place. ",11914,12025
148,But now take your little knife and cut off my head; ,12025,12077
149," then draw off my skin, roll it up and lay it at the foot of the rock. ",12076,12147
150,"But in it you must place the copper leaf, and the silver leaf, and the golden apple. ",12147,12232
151,"Outside, against the hill, is a stick, and if you want anything of me, all you need do is to knock at the mountain-side."" ",12232,12354
152,At first the princess could not at all make up her mind to do this; ,12354,12422
153," but when the bull told her that this was the only reward he wanted for all the good he had done her, she could not refuse. ",12421,12545
154,"It made her heart ache, yet in spite of it, she took her knife and cut until she had cut off the head of the great beast, and had drawn off his skin, and then she laid the latter at the foot of the rock, and in it she placed the copper leaf, and the silver leaf, and the golden apple. ",12545,12830
155,"When she had done this she went to the pig-sty, but she wept a great deal and felt sad. ",12830,12918
156,"Then she put on the wooden coat, and went to the king's castle in it. ",12918,12988
157,"She asked for a place in the kitchen, and said her name was Kari Woodencoat. ",12988,13065
158,"Yes, said the cook, she might have a place if she cared to wash up, for the girl who had formerly attended to it had run away. ",13065,13192
159,"""And after you have been here a while, no doubt you will have enough of it, and run away from us, too,"" said he. ",13192,13305
160,"No, indeed, she would not do so. ",13305,13338
161,She was most industrious at her washing up. ,13338,13382
162,On Sunday they expected company at the king's castle; ,13382,13436
163, and Kari asked permission to take up water to wash in to the prince. ,13435,13505
164,But the others laughed at her and cried; ,13505,13546
165," ""What do you want to do there? ",13545,13577
166,"Do you think the prince will have anything to do with you, homely as you are?"" ",13577,13656
167,"But she kept on asking, and at length received permission. ",13656,13715
168,"And then, as she ran up the stairs, her wooden coat clattered so loudly that the prince came out and asked: ""And who are you?"" ",13715,13842
169,"""I came to bring you water to wash in,"" said Kari. ",13842,13893
170,"""Do you think I want the water you are bringing me?"" ",13893,13946
171,"cried the prince, and poured the water out over her head. ",13946,14004
172,So she had to go off; ,14004,14026
173, but she asked permission to go to church. ,14025,14068
174,"And she received permission, for the church was close by. ",14068,14126
175,"But first she went to the rock and knocked at it with a stick, as the bull had told her. ",14126,14215
176,And a man came out at once and asked what she wanted. ,14215,14269
177,"The king's daughter said that she had permission to go to church and hear the sermon, but that she had no dress to wear. ",14269,14390
178,"Then the man gave her a dress that shone like the copper forest, and a horse and a saddle as well. ",14390,14489
179,"When she came to church she looked so beautiful that all the people wondered who she might be, and none of them listened to the sermon, because they were all looking at her. ",14489,14663
180,She even pleased the prince so much that he could not keep from looking at her. ,14663,14743
181,"When she left the church, the prince came after her, and closed the church door behind her, and kept one of the gloves she wore in his hand. ",14743,14884
182,"And then when she wanted to mount her horse, the prince came again, and asked her where she came from. ",14884,14987
183,"""From Washwaterland!"" ",14987,15009
184,"said Kari, and while the prince pulled out the glove and wanted to give it to her, she said: ""Be there light before me, and darkness behind, That the place I ride to the prince may not find!"" ",15009,15201
185,"The prince had never yet seen such a handsome glove, and he traveled far, looking for the native land of the noble lady who had abandoned her glove, but no one could tell him where it might be. ",15201,15395
186,"The following Sunday some one had to go up to the prince, and bring him a towel. ",15395,15476
187,"""Cannot I go up?"" ",15476,15494
188,begged Kari. ,15494,15507
189,"""Is that all you want?"" ",15507,15531
190,said the rest in the kitchen. ,15531,15561
191,"""You saw yourself what happened to you the last time!"" ",15561,15616
192,"But Kari kept on asking, and finally she received permission, after all, and ran up the stairs so that her wooden coat fairly clattered. ",15616,15753
193,"The prince at once thrust his head out of the door, and when he saw that it was Kari, he tore the towel out of her hand and flung it at her head. ",15753,15899
194,"""Off with you, you horrid creature!"" ",15899,15936
195,cried he. ,5592,5602
196,"""Do you think I want a towel that you have touched with your dirty fingers?"" ",15946,16023
197,"After that the prince went to church, and Kari also begged permission to go. ",16023,16100
198,"The people asked her why she wanted to go to church, since she had nothing to wear but her ugly, black wooden coat. ",16100,16216
199,"But Kari said the pastor preached so beautifully that she loved to listen to him, and finally they allowed her to go. ",16216,16334
200,"She went to the wall of rock and knocked, and the man came out and gave her a dress that was far handsomer than the first; ",16334,16457
201," it was embroidered all over with silver, and gleamed like the silver forest; ",16456,16534
202," and she also received a splendid horse, with housings embroidered with silver, and a silver bridle. ",16533,16634
203,"When the king's daughter came to the church, the people were still standing before the church door. ",16634,16734
204,"In their astonishment they all asked each other who she might be, and the prince came running up at once, and wanted to hold her horse while she dismounted. ",16734,16891
205,"But she jumped right down, and said it would not be necessary, since the horse was so tame that it would stand still when she commanded, and come to her if she wished. ",16891,17059
206,Then every one went into the church. ,17059,17096
207,But hardly any one paid any attention to the sermon; ,17096,17149
208," for they were all looking at Kari, and the prince fell deeper in love with her than he had the first time. ",17148,17256
209,"When the sermon was over, and she left the church and was about to mount her horse, the prince again came, and asked where she came from. ",17256,17394
210,"""From Towelland!"" ",17394,17412
211,"said she, and let fall her riding-whip. ",17412,17452
212,"And when the prince stooped to pick it up, she said: ""Be there light before me, and darkness behind, That the place I ride to the prince may not find!"" ",17452,17604
213,"Off she was, and the prince did not know what had become of her. ",17604,17669
214,"He wandered about in the world, far and wide, looking for her native land. ",17669,17744
215,"But no one could tell him where it might be, and with that the prince finally had to content himself. ",17744,17846
216,"The following Sunday some one was to go up to the prince, and bring him a comb. ",17846,17926
217,"Kari begged that they would let her go, but the others reminded her of what had happened the last time, and scolded her for showing herself to the prince, ugly as she was, and in her wooden coat. ",17926,18122
218,"But she kept on asking, and finally they let her go with the comb. ",18122,18189
219,"When she once more came clattering up the stairs, the prince thrust his head out of the door, tore the comb from her hand, and shouted at her to be off. ",18189,18342
220,"Then the prince went to church, and Kari wanted to go as well. ",18342,18405
221,"The rest again asked her why she wanted to go to church, ugly as she was, since she did not even have clothes fit to appear in before other people. ",18405,18553
222,"The prince, or some one else might happen to see her, and that would mean unhappiness for herself and others. ",18553,18663
223,"But Kari said that the people would have other things to look at besides herself, and finally they let her go. ",18663,18774
224,Then everything happened exactly as on the other two occasions. ,18774,18838
225,"She went to the wall of rock, and knocked with the stick, and then the man came out, and gave her a dress that was far more beautiful than both of the others. ",18838,18997
226,"It was all pure gold and diamonds, and she also received a beautiful horse, with housings embroidered with gold, and a golden bridle. ",18997,19131
227,"When the king's daughter came to the church, the pastor and all the congregation were still standing before the church door, waiting for her. ",19131,19273
228,"The prince came running up at once, and wanted to hold her horse, but she jumped down and said: ""No, thanks, it is not necessary, for my horse is so tame that he will remain standing when I tell him to do so."" ",19273,19483
229,"So they all went into the church, and the pastor mounted the pulpit. ",19483,19552
230,"But not a soul listened to the sermon, because all the people were looking at the princess, and wondering where she came from, and the prince fell still more deeply in love than he had on the two other occasions. ",19552,19765
231,"He paid no attention to anything, and looked only at her. ",19765,19823
232,"When the sermon was over, and the king's daughter left the church, the prince had poured tar on the floor of the vestibule, so that he might have a chance to help the king's daughter across. ",19823,20014
233,"But she paid no attention to it, stepped right into the middle of the tar, and leaped over. ",20014,20106
234,"But one of her golden shoes stuck fast, and when she had mounted her horse, the prince came running out of the church and asked her whence she came. ",20106,20255
235,"""From Combland!"" ",20255,20272
236,she answered. ,20272,20286
237,"But when the prince wanted to hand her the golden shoe, she said: ""Be there light before me, and darkness behind, That the place I ride to the prince may not find!"" ",20286,20451
238,"And again the prince did not know where she had gone, and he wandered about the world a long time, looking for Combland; ",20451,20572
239," but since no one could tell him where it might be, he let it be known that he would marry the girl whose foot the golden shoe fitted. ",20571,20706
240,Then the handsome and the homely came scurrying up from the ends of the earth; ,20706,20785
241, but none of them had a foot so small that they could put on the golden shoe. ,20784,20862
242,"At last Kari's evil stepmother and her daughter also came, and the shoe fitted the latter. ",20862,20953
243,"But she was very homely, and looked so unsatisfactory that the prince kept his promise most unwillingly. ",20953,21058
244,"Notwithstanding, preparations were made for the wedding, and she was adorned with her bridal finery, but when they rode to church, a little bird sat in a tree and sang: ""A bit of the heel, And a bit of the toe, Kari Woodencoat's shoe Is filled with blood, I know!"" ",21058,21323
245,"And when they looked, the bird had told the truth, for blood was dripping from the shoe. ",21323,21412
246,"Then all the maids and all the women who were at the castle had to try on the shoe, but it would fit none of them. ",21412,21527
247,"""But where is Kari Woodencoat?"" ",21527,21559
248,"asked the prince, for he had understood the song of the bird, and remembered it well. ",21559,21645
249,"""O she!"" ",21645,21654
250,said the others. ,21654,21671
251,"""It is not worth while having her come, for she has feet like a horse."" ",21671,21743
252,"""Be that as it may,"" said the prince. ",21743,21781
253,"""But all the rest have tried it on, so she shall try it on as well. ",21781,21849
254,"Kari!"" ",21849,21856
255,"he called out through the door, and Kari came clattering up the stairs so that everything shook, just as though a whole regiment of dragoons had arrived. ",21856,22010
256,"""Now you shall try on the golden shoe, and be a princess!"" ",22010,22069
257,"said the others, and made fun of her. ",22069,22107
258,"But Kari took the shoe, put her foot into it without a bit of trouble, cast off her wooden coat, and stood there in her golden dress, so that she was all a-sparkle, and on her other foot she had the golden shoe's mate. ",22107,22326
259,"The prince recognized her at once, put his arm around her, and kissed her. ",22326,22401
260,"And she told him that she was a king's daughter, which made him still more happy, and then they celebrated their wedding. ",22401,22523
261,"""spin, span, spun, Now our tale is done!""",22523,22565
