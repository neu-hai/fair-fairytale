0,"Once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a princess, but she could not marry anyone, because she was under an enchantment. ",0,146
1,"So the King set out to seek a fairy, and asked what he could do to win the Princess's love. ",146,238
2,"The Fairy said to him: ""You know that the Princess has a great cat which she is very fond of. ",238,332
3,"Whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat's tail is the man she is destined to marry."" ",332,423
4,"The King said to himself that this would not be very difficult, and he left the Fairy, determined to grind the cat's tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all. ",423,591
5,"You may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the Princess, and puss, as usual, marched in before him, arching his back. ",591,725
6,"The King took a long step, and quite thought he had the tail under his foot, but the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air. ",725,864
7,"And so it went on for eight days, till the King began to think that this fatal tail must be full of quicksilver-it was never still for a moment. ",864,1009
8,"At last, however, he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out. ",1009,1120
9,"So the King, without losing a moment, set his foot upon it heavily. ",1120,1188
10,"With one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man, who, fixing his angry eyes upon the King, said: ""You shall marry the Princess because you have been able to break the enchantment, but I will have my revenge. ",1188,1427
11,"You shall have a son, who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long, and if you ever tell anyone what I have just said to you, you shall vanish away instantly, and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again."" ",1427,1663
12,"Though the King was horribly afraid of the enchanter, he could not help laughing at this threat. ",1663,1760
13,"""If my son has such a long nose as that,"" he said to himself, ""he must always see it or feel it; ",1760,1857
14," at least, if he is not blind or without hands."" ",1856,1905
15,"But, as the enchanter had vanished, he did not waste any more time in thinking, but went to seek the Princess, who very soon consented to marry him. ",1905,2054
16,"But after all, they had not been married very long when the King died, and the Queen had nothing left to care for but her little son, who was called Hyacinth. ",2054,2213
17,"The little Prince had large blue eyes, the prettiest eyes in the world, and a sweet little mouth, but, alas! ",2213,2322
18,his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face. ,2322,2378
19,"The Queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose, but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked; ",2378,2508
20," that it was a Roman nose, and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose. ",2507,2612
21,"The Queen, who was devoted to her baby, was pleased with what they told her, and when she looked at Hyacinth again, his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large. ",2612,2783
22,The Prince was brought up with great care; ,2783,2826
23," and, as soon as he could speak, they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses. ",2825,2936
24,"No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own, and the courtiers, to get into favor with the Queen, took to pulling their babies' noses several times every day to make them grow long. ",2936,3159
25,"But, do what they would, they were nothing by comparison with the Prince's. ",3159,3235
26,When he grew sensible he learned history; ,3235,3277
27," and whenever any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of, his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses. ",3276,3405
28,"His room was hung with pictures, all of people with very large noses; ",3405,3475
29," and the Prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty, that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter! ",3474,3621
30,"When his twentieth birthday was passed the Queen thought it was time that he should be married, so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see, and among the others was a picture of the Dear Little Princess! ",3621,3873
31,"Now, she was the daughter of a great king, and would some day possess several kingdoms herself; ",3873,3969
32," but Prince Hyacinth had not a thought to spare for anything of that sort, he was so much struck with her beauty. ",3968,4082
33,"The Princess, whom he thought quite charming, had, however, a little saucy nose, which, in her face, was the prettiest thing possible, but it was a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers, who had got into such a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves laughing at hers before they had time to think; ",4082,4420
34," but this did not do at all before the Prince, who quite failed to see the joke, and actually banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully the Dear Little Princess's tiny nose! ",4419,4622
35,"The others, taking warning from this, learned to think twice before they spoke, and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose, still, a woman's beauty was a different thing; ",4622,4890
36," and he knew a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a ""tip-tilted"" nose! ",4889,5036
37,"The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news, and at once sent ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in marriage. ",5036,5181
38,"The King, her father, gave his consent; ",5181,5221
39," and Prince Hyacinth, who, in his anxiety to see the Princess, had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when, to the horror of all who stood by, the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning, and, snatching up the Dear Little Princess, whirled her away out of their sight! ",5220,5536
40,"The Prince was left quite unconsolable, and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again, and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him, he mounted his horse and rode sadly away, letting the animal choose his own path. ",5536,5816
41,"So it happened that he came presently to a great plain, across which he rode all day long without seeing a single house, and horse and rider were terribly hungry, when, as the night fell, the Prince caught sight of a light, which seemed to shine from a cavern. ",5816,6077
42,"He rode up to it, and saw a little old woman, who appeared to be at least a hundred years old. ",6077,6172
43,"She put on her spectacles to look at Prince Hyacinth, but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short. ",6172,6326
44,"The Prince and the Fairy (for that was who she was) had no sooner looked at one another than they went into fits of laughter, and cried at the same moment, ""Oh, what a funny nose!"" ",6326,6507
45,"""Not so funny as your own,"" said Prince Hyacinth to the Fairy; ",6507,6570
46," ""but, madam, I beg you to leave the consideration of our noses-such as they are-and to be good enough to give me something to eat, for I am starving, and so is my poor horse."" ",6569,6746
47,"""With all my heart,"" said the Fairy. ",6746,6783
48,"""Though your nose is so ridiculous you are, nevertheless, the son of my best friend. ",6783,6868
49,I loved your father as if he had been my brother. ,6868,6918
50,"Now he had a very handsome nose!"" ",6918,6952
51,"""And pray what does mine lack?"" ",6952,6984
52,said the Prince. ,6984,7001
53,"""Oh! ",7001,7006
54,"it doesn't lack anything,"" replied the Fairy. ",7006,7052
55,"""On the contrary quite, there is only too much of it. ",7052,7106
56,"But never mind, one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long. ",7106,7180
57,I was telling you that I was your father's friend; ,7180,7231
58," he often came to see me in the old times, and you must know that I was very pretty in those days; ",7230,7329
59," at least, he used to say so. ",7328,7358
60,"I should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time I ever saw him."" ",7358,7440
61,"""Indeed,"" said the Prince, ""when I have supped it will give me the greatest pleasure to hear it; ",7440,7537
62," but consider, madam, I beg of you, that I have had nothing to eat to-day."" ",7536,7612
63,"""The poor boy is right,"" said the Fairy; ",7612,7653
64," ""I was forgetting. ",7652,7672
65,"Come in, then, and I will give you some supper, and while you are eating I can tell you my story in a very few words-for I don't like endless tales myself. ",7672,7828
66,"Too long a tongue is worse than too long a nose, and I remember when I was young that I was so much admired for not being a great chatterer. ",7828,7969
67,"They used to tell the Queen, my mother, that it was so. ",7969,8025
68,"For though you see what I am now, I was the daughter of a great king. ",8025,8095
69,"My father--"" ""Your father, I dare say, got something to eat when he was hungry!"" ",8095,8176
70,interrupted the Prince. ,8176,8200
71,"""Oh! ",7001,7006
72,"certainly,"" answered the Fairy, ""and you also shall have supper directly. ",8205,8279
73,"I only just wanted to tell you--"" ""But I really cannot listen to anything until I have had something to eat,"" cried the Prince, who was getting quite angry; ",8279,8436
74," but then, remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the Fairy's help, he added: ""I know that in the pleasure of listening to you I should quite forget my own hunger; ",8435,8619
75," but my horse, who cannot hear you, must really be fed!"" ",8618,8675
76,"The Fairy was very much flattered by this compliment, and said, calling to her servants: ""You shall not wait another minute, you are so polite, and in spite of the enormous size of your nose you are really very agreeable."" ",8675,8898
77,"""Plague take the old lady! ",8898,8925
78,"How she does go on about my nose!"" ",8925,8960
79,said the Prince to himself. ,8960,8988
80,"""One would almost think that mine had taken all the extra length that hers lacks! ",8988,9070
81,If I were not so hungry I would soon have done with this chatterpie who thinks she talks very little! ,9070,9172
82,How stupid people are not to see their own faults! ,9172,9223
83,"That comes of being a princess: she has been spoiled by flatterers, who have made her believe that she is quite a moderate talker!"" ",9223,9355
84,"Meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the table, and the prince was much amused to hear the Fairy who asked them a thousand questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself speak; ",9355,9551
85," especially he noticed one maid who, no matter what was being said, always contrived to praise her mistress's wisdom. ",9550,9668
86,"""Well!"" ",9668,9676
87,"he thought, as he ate his supper, ""I'm very glad I came here. ",9676,9738
88,This just shows me how sensible I have been in never listening to flatterers. ,9738,9816
89,"People of that sort praise us to our faces without shame, and hide our faults or change them into virtues. ",9816,9923
90,For my part I never will be taken in by them. ,9923,9969
91,"I know my own defects, I hope."" ",9969,10001
92,Poor Prince Hyacinth! ,10001,10023
93,"He really believed what he said, and hadn't an idea that the people who had praised his nose were laughing at him, just as the Fairy's maid was laughing at her; ",10023,10184
94, for the Prince had seen her laugh slyly when she could do so without the Fairy's noticing her. ,10183,10279
95,"However, he said nothing, and presently, when his hunger began to be appeased, the Fairy said: ""My dear Prince, might I beg you to move a little more that way, for your nose casts such a shadow that I really cannot see what I have on my plate. ",10279,10523
96,Ah! ,10523,10527
97,thanks. ,10527,10535
98,Now let us speak of your father. ,10535,10568
99,"When I went to his Court he was only a little boy, but that is forty years ago, and I have been in this desolate place ever since. ",10568,10699
100,Tell me what goes on nowadays; ,10699,10730
101, are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever? ,10729,10775
102,"In my time one saw them at parties, theatres, balls, and promenades every day. ",10775,10854
103,Dear me! ,10854,10863
104,what a long nose you have! ,10863,10890
105,"I cannot get used to it!"" ",10890,10916
106,"""Really, madam,"" said the Prince, ""I wish you would leave off mentioning my nose. ",10916,10998
107,It cannot matter to you what it is like. ,10998,11039
108,"I am quite satisfied with it, and have no wish to have it shorter. ",11039,11106
109,"One must take what is given one."" ",11106,11140
110,"""Now you are angry with me, my poor Hyacinth,"" said the Fairy, ""and I assure you that I didn't mean to vex you; ",11140,11252
111," on the contrary, I wished to do you a service. ",11251,11299
112,"However, though I really cannot help your nose being a shock to me, I will try not to say anything about it. ",11299,11408
113,I will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose. ,11408,11465
114,"To tell the truth, it would make three reasonable ones."" ",11465,11522
115,"The Prince, who was no longer hungry, grew so impatient at the Fairy's continual remarks about his nose that at last he threw himself upon his horse and rode hastily away. ",11522,11694
116,"But wherever he came in his journeyings he thought the people were mad, for they all talked of his nose, and yet he could not bring himself to admit that it was too long, he had been so used all his life to hear it called handsome. ",11694,11926
117,"The old Fairy, who wished to make him happy, at last hit upon a plan. ",11926,11996
118,"She shut the Dear Little Princess up in a palace of crystal, and put this palace down where the Prince would not fail to find it. ",11996,12126
119,"His joy at seeing the Princess again was extreme, and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison; ",12126,12242
120, but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly. ,12241,12293
121,"In despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the Dear Little Princess, who, on her part, stretched out her hand that he might kiss it; ",12293,12463
122," but turn which way he might, he never could raise it to his lips, for his long nose always prevented it. ",12462,12568
123,"For the first time he realized how long it really was, and exclaimed: ""Well, it must be admitted that my nose is too long!"" ",12568,12692
124,"In an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters, and the old Fairy, taking the Dear Little Princess by the hand, said to the Prince: ""Now, say if you are not very much obliged to me. ",12692,12891
125,Much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose! ,12891,12947
126,You would never have found out how extraordinary it was if it hadn't hindered you from doing what you wanted to. ,12947,13060
127,You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own defects of mind and body. ,13060,13138
128,Our reason tries in vain to show them to us; ,13138,13183
129," we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests."" ",13182,13253
130,"Prince Hyacinth, whose nose was now just like anyone's else, did not fail to profit by the lesson he had received. ",13253,13368
131,"He married the Dear Little Princess, and they lived happily ever after.",13368,13440
