121,He went up into a tree and began throwing down the apples. ,12140,12199
122,"The second giant came running, and said, ""What's the meaning of throwing my wall and letting in your cattle on my estate? ",12199,12321

134,"""Oh, I'll take care of that myself,"" says the boy. ",13245,13296
135,When he drove the cows home that night there was wonder on the people when they saw the quantity of milk they had. ,13296,13411
136,"The gentleman said that there was another change in the caher that day again, as he did not hear but only one shout, but the lad said that he saw another one going away that day, and that it was likely that he did not come back yet. ",13411,13644
137,"On the next day he went out, and drove the pigs and the cows up to the hall door, and was throwing down the apples to them. ",13644,13768
138,"The third giant came out--the eldest man of them--and he was full mad after his two brothers being dead, and the teeth that were in his head were making a hand-stick for him. ",13768,13943
139,He told the boy to come down; ,13943,13973

156,"He was a while in that way herding the cows and everything that was in the castle, he had it. ",15464,15558
157,"There was no one at all going near the castle, for there was fear on them. ",15558,15633

166,"But when he got them all gone he went to the castle of the three giants, and he put a saddle on the best steed they had, and a fine suit on himself, and he took the first giant's sword in his hand, and he went to where the dragon was. ",16312,16547
167,"It was like a fair there, with the number of riders and coaches and horses and people that were gathered in it. ",16547,16659
168,"There was a young lady bound to a post on the brink of the sea, and she waiting for the dragon to come to swallow her. ",16659,16778
169,"It was the King's daughter that was in it, for the dragon would not take any other woman. ",16778,16868
170,"When the dragon came out of the sea the lad went against him, and they fought with one another, and were fighting till the evening, until the dragon was frothing at the mouth, and till the sea was red with its blood. ",16868,17085
171,He turned the dragon out into the sea at last. ,17085,17132
172,"He went away then, and said that he would return the next day. ",17132,17195
173,"He left the steed again in the place where he found it, and he took the fine suit off him, and when the other people returned he was before them. ",17195,17341

175,"That was the story that every person had, but they did not know who was the champion who did it. ",17499,17596
176,"The next day, when his master and the other people were gone, he went to the castle of the three giants again, and he took out another steed and another suit of valour (i.e., armour), and he brought with him the second giant's sword, and he went to the place where the dragon was to come.

177,"The King's daughter was bound to a post on the shore, waiting for him, and the eyes going out on her head looking would she see the champion coming who fought the dragon the day before. ",17885,18071
178,"There were twice as many people in it as there were on the first day, and they were all waiting till they would see the champion coming. ",18071,18208
179,"When the dragon came the lad went in face of him, and the dragon was half confused and sickened after the fight that he had made the day before. ",18208,18353

183,When his master came home that evening the lad was in the house before him. ,18509,18585
184,"The master told him that another champion came that day, and that he had turned the dragon into the sea. ",18585,18690
185,But no doubt the lad knew the story better himself than he did. ,18690,18754
186,"On the next day, when the gentleman was gone, he went to the caher of the giants, and he took with him another steed and another suit and the sword of the third giant, and when he came to fight with the dragon the people thought it was another champion who was in it. ",18754,19022
187,"He himself and the dragon were beating each other, then, and the sorra such a fight you ever saw. ",19022,19120
188,"There were wings on the dragon, and when he was getting it tight he rose up in the air, and he was thrusting and beating the boy in his skull till he was nearly destroyed. ",19120,19292
189,"He remembered the black thong then, and said, ""Black thong, bind that one so hard that they'll be listening to his screeching in the two divisions of the world with the squeezing that you'll give him."" ",19292,19494
190,"The black thong leapt away, and she bound him, and then the lad took the head off him, and the sea was red with his blood, and the waves of blood were going on the top of the water. ",19494,19676
