0,"Long, long ago there lived, an old man and an old woman; ",0,57
1," they were peasants, and had to work hard to earn their daily rice. ",56,124
2,"The old man used to go and cut grass for the farmers around, and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little rice field. ",124,301
3,One day the old man went to the hills as usual to cut grass and the old woman took some clothes to the river to wash. ,301,419
4,"It was nearly summer, and the country was very beautiful to see in its fresh greenness as the two old people went on their way to work. ",419,555
5,"The grass on the banks of the river looked like emerald velvet, and the pussy willows along the edge of the water were shaking out their soft tassels. ",555,706
6,"The breezes blew and ruffled the smooth surface of the water into wavelets, and passing on touched the cheeks of the old couple who, for some reason they could not explain, felt very happy that morning. ",706,909
7,The old woman at last found a nice spot by the river bank and put her basket down. ,909,992
8,Then she set to work to wash the clothes; ,992,1034
9, she took them one by one out of the basket and washed them in the river and rubbed them on the stones. ,1033,1137
10,"The water was as clear as crystal, and she could see the tiny fish swimming to and fro, and the pebbles at the bottom. ",1137,1256
11,As she was busy washing her clothes a great peach came bumping down the stream. ,1256,1336
12,The old woman looked up from her work and saw this large peach. ,1336,1400
13,"She was sixty years of age, yet in all her life she had never seen such a big peach as this. ",1400,1493
14,"""How delicious that peach must be!"" ",1493,1529
15,she said to herself. ,1529,1550
16,"""I must certainly get it and take it home to my old man."" ",1550,1608
17,"She stretched out her arm to try and get it, but it was quite out of her reach. ",1608,1688
18,"She looked about for a stick, but there was not one to be seen, and if she went to look for one she would lose the peach. ",1688,1810
19,"Stopping a moment to think what she would do, she remembered an old charm-verse. ",1810,1891
20,"Now she began to clap her hands to keep time to the rolling of the peach down stream, and while she clapped she sang this song: ""Distant water is bitter, The near water is sweet; ",1891,2070
21," Pass by the distant water And come into the sweet."" ",2069,2122
22,"Strange to say, as soon as she began to repeat this little song the peach began to come nearer and nearer the bank where the old woman was standing, till at last it stopped just in front of her so that she was able to take it up in her hands. ",2122,2365
23,The old woman was delighted. ,2365,2394
24,"She could not go on with her work, so happy and excited was she, so she put all the clothes back in her bamboo basket, and with the basket on her back and the peach in her hand she hurried homewards. ",2394,2594
25,It seemed a very long time to her to wait till her husband returned. ,2594,2663
26,"The old man at last came back as the sun was setting, with a big bundle of grass on his back--so big that he was almost hidden and she could hardly see him. ",2663,2820
27,"He seemed very tired and used the scythe for a walking stick, leaning on it as he walked along. ",2820,2916
28,"As soon as the old woman saw him she called out: ""O Fii San! ",2916,2977
29,"(old man) I have been waiting for you to come home for such a long time to-day!"" ",2977,3058
30,"""What is the matter? ",3058,3079
31,"Why are you so impatient?"" ",3079,3106
32,"asked the old man, wondering at her unusual eagerness. ",3106,3161
33,"""Has anything happened while I have been away?"" ",3161,3209
34,"""Oh, no!"" ",3209,3219
35,"answered the old woman, ""nothing has happened, only I have found a nice present for you!"" ",3219,3309
36,"""That is good,"" said the old man. ",3309,3343
37,He then washed his feet in a basin of water and stepped up to the veranda. ,3343,3418
38,The old woman now ran into the little room and brought out from the cupboard the big peach. ,3418,3510
39,It felt even heavier than before. ,3510,3544
40,"She held it up to him, saying: ""Just look at this! ",3544,3595
41,"Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?"" ",3595,3650
42,"When the old man looked at the peach he was greatly astonished and said: ""This is indeed the largest peach I have ever seen! ",3650,3775
43,"Wherever did you buy it?"" ",3775,3801
44,"""I did not buy it,"" answered the old woman. ",3801,3845
45,"""I found it in the river where I was washing."" ",3845,3892
46,And she told him the whole story. ,3892,3926
47,"""I am very glad that you have found it. ",3926,3966
48,"Let us eat it now, for I am hungry,"" said the O Fii San. ",3966,4023
49,"He brought out the kitchen knife, and, placing the peach on a board, was about to cut it when, wonderful to tell, the peach split in two of itself and a clear voice said: ""Wait a bit, old man!"" ",4023,4217
50,and out stepped a beautiful little child. ,4217,4259
51,The old man and his wife were both so astonished at what they saw that they fell to the ground. ,4259,4355
52,"The child spoke again: ""Don't be afraid. ",4355,4396
53,I am no demon or fairy. ,4396,4420
54,I will tell you the truth. ,4420,4447
55,Heaven has had compassion on you. ,4447,4481
56,Every day and every night you have lamented that you had no child. ,4481,4548
57,"Your cry has been heard and I am sent to be the son of your old age!"" ",4548,4618
58,On hearing this the old man and his wife were very happy. ,4618,4676
59,"They had cried night and day for sorrow at having no child to help them in their lonely old age, and now that their prayer was answered they were so lost with joy that they did not know where to put their hands or their feet. ",4676,4902
60,"First the old man took the child up in his arms, and then the old woman did the same; ",4902,4988
61," and they named him MOMOTARO, OR SON OF A PEACH, because he had come out of a peach. ",4987,5072
62,The years passed quickly by and the child grew to be fifteen years of age. ,5072,5147
63,"He was taller and far stronger than any other boys of his own age, he had a handsome face and a heart full of courage, and he was very wise for his years. ",5147,5302
64,"The old couple's pleasure was very great when they looked at him, for he was just what they thought a hero ought to be like. ",5302,5427
65,"One day Momotaro came to his foster-father and said solemnly: ""Father, by a strange chance we have become father and son. ",5427,5549
66,"Your goodness to me has been higher than the mountain grasses which it was your daily work to cut, and deeper than the river where my mother washes the clothes. ",5549,5710
67,"I do not know how to thank you enough."" ",5710,5750
68,"""Why,"" answered the old man, ""it is a matter of course that a father should bring up his son. ",5750,5844
69,"When you are older it will be your turn to take care of us, so after all there will be no profit or loss between us--all will be equal. ",5844,5980
70,"Indeed, I am rather surprised that you should thank me in this way!"" ",5980,6049
71,and the old man looked bothered. ,6049,6082
72,"""I hope you will be patient with me,"" said Momotaro; ",6082,6135
73," ""but before I begin to pay back your goodness to me I have a request to make which I hope you will grant me above everything else."" ",6134,6267
74,"""I will let you do whatever you wish, for you are quite different to all other boys!"" ",6267,6353
75,"""Then let me go away at once!"" ",6353,6384
76,"""What do you say? ",6384,6402
77,"Do you wish to leave your old father and mother and go away from your old home?"" ",6402,6483
78,"""I will surely come back again, if you let me go now!"" ",6483,6538
79,"""Where are you going?"" ",6538,6561
80,"""You must think it strange that I want to go away,"" said Momotaro, ""because I have not yet told you my reason. ",6561,6672
81,Far away from here to the northeast of Japan there is an island in the sea. ,6672,6748
82,This island is the stronghold of a band of devils. ,6748,6799
83,"I have often heard how they invade this land, kill and rob the people, and carry off all they can find. ",6799,6903
84,They are not only very wicked but they are disloyal to our Emperor and disobey his laws. ,6903,6992
85,"They are also cannibals, for they kill and eat some of the poor people who are so unfortunate as to fall into their hands. ",6992,7115
86,These devils are very hateful beings. ,7115,7153
87,I must go and conquer them and bring back all the plunder of which they have robbed this land. ,7153,7248
88,"It is for this reason that I want to go away for a short time!"" ",7248,7312
89,The old man was much surprised at hearing all this from a mere boy of fifteen. ,7312,7391
90,He thought it best to let the boy go. ,7391,7429
91,"He was strong and fearless, and besides all this, the old man knew he was no common child, for he had been sent to them as a gift from Heaven, and he felt quite sure that the devils would be powerless to harm him. ",7429,7643
92,"""All you say is very interesting, Momotaro,"" said the old man. ",7643,7706
93,"""I will not hinder you in your determination. ",7706,7752
94,You may go if you wish. ,7752,7776
95,"Go to the island as soon as ever you like and destroy the demons and bring peace to the land."" ",7776,7871
96,"""Thank you, for all your kindness,"" said Momotaro, who began to get ready to go that very day. ",7871,7966
97,He was full of courage and did not know what fear was. ,7966,8021
98,The old man and woman at once set to work to pound rice in the kitchen mortar to make cakes for Momotaro to take with him on his journey. ,8021,8159
99,At last the cakes were made and Momotaro was ready to start on his long journey. ,8159,8240
100,Parting is always sad. ,8240,8263
101,So it was now. ,8263,8278
102,"The eyes of the two old people were filled with tears and their voices trembled as they said: ""Go with all care and speed. ",8278,8401
103,"We expect you back victorious!"" ",8401,8433
104,"Momotaro was very sorry to leave his old parents (though he knew he was coming back as soon as he could), for he thought of how lonely they would be while he was away. ",8433,8601
105,"But he said ""Good-by!"" ",8601,8624
106,quite bravely. ,8624,8639
107,"""I am going now. ",8639,8656
108,Take good care of yourselves while I am away. ,8656,8702
109,"Good-by!"" ",8614,8624
110,And he stepped quickly out of the house. ,8712,8753
111,In silence the eyes of Momotaro and his parents met in farewell. ,8753,8818
112,Momotaro now hurried on his way till it was midday. ,8818,8870
113,"He began to feel hungry, so he opened his bag and took out one of the rice-cakes and sat down under a tree by the side of the road to eat it. ",8870,9012
114,While he was thus having his lunch a dog almost as large as a colt came running out from the high grass. ,9012,9117
115,"He made straight for Momotaro, and showing his teeth, said in a fierce way: ""You are a rude man to pass my field without asking permission first. ",9117,9263
116,If you leave me all the cakes you have in your bag you may go; ,9263,9326
117," otherwise I will bite you till I kill you!"" ",9325,9370
118,"Momotaro only laughed scornfully: ""What is that you are saying? ",9370,9434
119,Do you know who I am? ,9434,9456
120,"I am Momotaro, and I am on my way to subdue the devils in their island stronghold in the northeast of Japan. ",9456,9565
121,"If you try to stop me on my way there I will cut you in two from the head downwards!"" ",9565,9651
122,The dog's manner at once changed. ,9651,9685
123,"His tail dropped between his legs, and coming near he bowed so low that his forehead touched the ground. ",9685,9790
124,"""What do I hear? ",9790,9807
125,The name of Momotaro? ,9807,9829
126,Are you indeed Momotaro? ,9829,9854
127,I have often heard of your great strength. ,9854,9897
128,Not knowing who you were I have behaved in a very stupid way. ,9897,9959
129,Will you please pardon my rudeness? ,9959,9995
130,Are you indeed on your way to invade the Island of Devils? ,9995,10054
131,"If you will take such a rude fellow with you as one of your followers, I shall be very grateful to you."" ",10054,10159
132,"""I think I can take you with me if you wish to go,"" said Momotaro. ",10159,10226
133,"""Thank you!"" ",10226,10239
134,said the dog. ,10239,10253
135,"""By the way, I am very very hungry. ",10253,10289
136,"Will you give me one of the cakes you are carrying?"" ",10289,10342
137,"""This is the best kind of cake there is in Japan,"" said Momotaro. ",10342,10408
138,"""I cannot spare you a whole one; ",10408,10441
139," I will give you half of one."" ",10440,10471
140,"""Thank you very much,"" said the dog, taking the piece thrown to him. ",10471,10540
141,Then Momotaro got up and the dog followed. ,10540,10583
142,For a long time they walked over the hills and through the valleys. ,10583,10651
143,As they were going along an animal came down from a tree a little ahead of them. ,10651,10732
144,"The creature soon came up to Momotaro and said: ""Good morning, Momotaro! ",10732,10805
145,You are welcome in this part of the country. ,10805,10850
146,"Will you allow me to go with you?"" ",10850,10885
147,"The dog answered jealously: ""Momotaro already has a dog to accompany him. ",10885,10959
148,Of what use is a monkey like you in battle? ,10959,11003
149,We are on our way to fight the devils! ,11003,11042
150,"Get away!"" ",11042,11053
151,"The dog and the monkey began to quarrel and bite, for these two animals always hate each other. ",11053,11149
152,"""Now, don't quarrel!"" ",11149,11171
153,"said Momotaro, putting himself between them. ",11171,11216
154,"""Wait a moment, dog!"" ",11216,11238
155,"""It is not at all dignified for you to have such a creature as that following you!"" ",11238,11322
156,said the dog. ,10239,10253
157,"""What do you know about it?"" ",11336,11365
158,asked Momotaro; ,11365,11381
159," and pushing aside the dog, he spoke to the monkey: ""Who are you?"" ",11380,11447
160,"""I am a monkey living in these hills,"" replied the monkey. ",11447,11506
161,"""I heard of your expedition to the Island of Devils, and I have come to go with you. ",11506,11591
162,"Nothing will please me more than to follow you!"" ",11591,11640
163,"""Do you really wish to go to the Island of Devils and fight with me?"" ",11640,11710
164,"""Yes, sir,"" replied the monkey. ",11710,11742
165,"""I admire your courage,"" said Momotaro. ",11742,11782
166,"""Here is a piece of one of my fine rice-cakes. ",11782,11829
167,"Come along!"" ",11829,11842
168,So the monkey joined Momotaro. ,11842,11873
169,The dog and the monkey did not get on well together. ,11873,11926
170,"They were always snapping at each other as they went along, and always wanting to have a fight. ",11926,12022
171,"This made Momotaro very cross, and at last he sent the dog on ahead with a flag and put the monkey behind with a sword, and he placed himself between them with a war-fan, which is made of iron. ",12022,12216
172,By and by they came to a large field. ,12216,12254
173,Here a bird flew down and alighted on the ground just in front of the little party. ,12254,12338
174,It was the most beautiful bird Momotaro had ever seen. ,12338,12393
175,On its body were five different robes of feathers and its head was covered with a scarlet cap. ,12393,12488
176,The dog at once ran at the bird and tried to seize and kill it. ,12488,12552
177,"But the bird struck out its spurs and flew at the dog's tail, and the fight went hard with both. ",12552,12649
178,"Momotaro, as he looked on, could not help admiring the bird; ",12649,12710
179, it showed so much spirit in the fight. ,12709,12749
180,It would certainly make a good fighter. ,12749,12789
181,"Momotaro went up to the two combatants, and holding the dog back, said to the bird: ""You rascal! ",12789,12886
182,you are hindering my journey. ,12886,12916
183,"Surrender at once, and I will take you with me. ",12916,12964
184,"If you don't I will set this dog to bite your head off!"" ",12964,13021
185,"Then the bird surrendered at once, and begged to be taken into Momotaro's company. ",13021,13104
186,"""I do not know what excuse to offer for quarreling with the dog, your servant, but I did not see you. ",13104,13206
187,I am a miserable bird called a pheasant. ,13206,13247
188,It is very generous of you to pardon my rudeness and to take me with you. ,13247,13321
189,"Please allow me to follow you behind the dog and the monkey!"" ",13321,13383
190,"""I congratulate you on surrendering so soon,"" said Momotaro, smiling. ",13383,13453
191,"""Come and join us in our raid on the devils."" ",13453,13499
192,"""Are you going to take this bird with you also?"" ",13499,13548
193,"asked the dog, interrupting. ",13548,13577
194,"""Why do you ask such an unnecessary question? ",13577,13623
195,Didn't you hear what I said? ,13623,13652
196,"I take the bird with me because I wish to!"" ",13652,13696
197,"""Humph!"" ",13696,13705
198,said the dog. ,10239,10253
199,"Then Momotaro stood and gave this order: ""Now all of you must listen to me. ",13719,13795
200,The first thing necessary in an army is harmony. ,13795,13844
201,It is a wise saying which says that 'Advantage on earth is better than advantage in Heaven!' ,13844,13937
202,Union amongst ourselves is better than any earthly gain. ,13937,13994
203,When we are not at peace amongst ourselves it is no easy thing to subdue an enemy. ,13994,14077
204,"From now, you three, the dog, the monkey and the pheasant, must be friends with one mind. ",14077,14167
205,"The one who first begins a quarrel will be discharged on the spot!"" ",14167,14235
206,All the three promised not to quarrel. ,14235,14274
207,"The pheasant was now made a member of Momotaro's suite, and received half a cake. ",14274,14356
208,"Momotaro's influence was so great that the three became good friends, and hurried onwards with him as their leader. ",14356,14472
209,Hurrying on day after day they at last came out upon the shore of the North-Eastern Sea. ,14472,14561
210,There was nothing to be seen as far as the horizon--not a sign of any island. ,14561,14639
211,All that broke the stillness was the rolling of the waves upon the shore. ,14639,14713
212,"Now, the dog and the monkey and the pheasant had come very bravely all the way through the long valleys and over the hills, but they had never seen the sea before, and for the first time since they set out they were bewildered and gazed at each other in silence. ",14713,14976
213,How were they to cross the water and get to the Island of Devils? ,14976,15042
214,"Momotaro soon saw that they were daunted by the sight of the sea, and to try them he spoke loudly and roughly: ""Why do you hesitate? ",15042,15175
215,Are you afraid of the sea? ,15175,15202
216,Oh! ,15202,15206
217,what cowards you are! ,15206,15228
218,It is impossible to take such weak creatures as you with me to fight the demons. ,15228,15309
219,It will be far better for me to go alone. ,15309,15351
220,"I discharge you all at once!"" ",15351,15381
221,"The three animals were taken aback at this sharp reproof, and clung to Momotaro's sleeve, begging him not to send them away. ",15381,15506
222,"""Please, Momotaro!"" ",15506,15526
223,said the dog. ,10239,10253
224,"""We have come thus far!"" ",15540,15565
225,said the monkey. ,15565,15582
226,"""It is inhuman to leave us here!"" ",15582,15616
227,said the pheasant. ,15616,15635
228,"""We are not at all afraid of the sea,"" said the monkey again. ",15635,15697
229,"""Please do take us with you,"" said the pheasant. ",15697,15746
230,"""Do please,"" said the dog. ",15746,15773
231,"They had now gained a little courage, so Momotaro said: ""Well, then, I will take you with me, but be careful!"" ",15773,15884
232,"Momotaro now got a small ship, and they all got on board. ",15884,15942
233,"The wind and weather were fair, and the ship went like an arrow over the sea. ",15942,16020
234,"It was the first time they had ever been on the water, and so at first the dog, the monkey and the pheasant were frightened at the waves and the rolling of the vessel, but by degrees they grew accustomed to the water and were quite happy again. ",16020,16265
235,"Every day they paced the deck of their little ship, eagerly looking out for the demons' island. ",16265,16361
236,"When they grew tired of this, they told each other stories of all their exploits of which they were proud, and then played games together; ",16361,16500
237," and Momotaro found much to amuse him in listening to the three animals and watching their antics, and in this way he forgot that the way was long and that he was tired of the voyage and of doing nothing. ",16499,16704
238,He longed to be at work killing the monsters who had done so much harm in his country. ,16704,16791
239,"As the wind blew in their favor and they met no storms the ship made a quick voyage, and one day when the sun was shining brightly a sight of land rewarded the four watchers at the bow. ",16791,16977
240,Momotaro knew at once that what they saw was the devils' stronghold. ,16977,17046
241,"On the top of the precipitous shore, looking out to sea, was a large castle. ",17046,17123
242,"Now that his enterprise was close at hand, he was deep in thought with his head leaning on his hands, wondering how he should begin the attack. ",17123,17267
243,"His three followers watched him, waiting for orders. ",17267,17320
244,"At last he called to the pheasant: ""It is a great advantage for us to have you with us."" ",17320,17409
245,"said Momotaro to the bird, ""for you have good wings. ",17409,17462
246,Fly at once to the castle and engage the demons to fight. ,17462,17520
247,"We will follow you."" ",17520,17541
248,The pheasant at once obeyed. ,17541,17570
249,He flew off from the ship beating the air gladly with his wings. ,17570,17635
250,"The bird soon reached the island and took up his position on the roof in the middle of the castle, calling out loudly: ""All you devils listen to me! ",17635,17784
251,The great Japanese general Momotaro has come to fight you and to take your stronghold from you. ,17784,17880
252,"If you wish to save your lives surrender at once, and in token of your submission you must break off the horns that grow on your forehead. ",17880,18019
253,"If you do not surrender at once, but make up your mind to fight, we, the pheasant, the dog and the monkey, will kill you all by biting and tearing you to death!"" ",18019,18181
254,"The horned demons looking up and only seeing a pheasant, laughed and said: ""A wild pheasant, indeed! ",18181,18282
255,It is ridiculous to hear such words from a mean thing like you. ,18282,18346
256,"Wait till you get a blow from one of our iron bars!"" ",18346,18399
257,"Very angry, indeed, were the devils. ",18399,18436
258,"They shook their horns and their shocks of red hair fiercely, and rushed to put on tiger skin trousers to make themselves look more terrible. ",18436,18578
259,"They then brought out great iron bars and ran to where the pheasant perched over their heads, and tried to knock him down. ",18578,18701
260,"The pheasant flew to one side to escape the blow, and then attacked the head of first one and then another demon. ",18701,18815
261,"He flew round and round them, beating the air with his wings so fiercely and ceaselessly, that the devils began to wonder whether they had to fight one or many more birds. ",18815,18987
262,"In the meantime, Momotaro had brought his ship to land. ",18987,19043
263,"As they had approached, he saw that the shore was like a precipice, and that the large castle was surrounded by high walls and large iron gates and was strongly fortified. ",19043,19215
264,"Momotaro landed, and with the hope of finding some way of entrance, walked up the path towards the top, followed by the monkey and the dog. ",19215,19355
265,They soon came upon two beautiful damsels washing clothes in a stream. ,19355,19426
266,"Momotaro saw that the clothes were blood-stained, and that as the two maidens washed, the tears were falling fast down their cheeks. ",19426,19559
267,"He stopped and spoke to them: ""Who are you, and why do you weep?"" ",19559,19625
268,"""We are captives of the Demon King. ",19625,19661
269,"We were carried away from our homes to this island, and though we are the daughters of Daimios (Lords), we are obliged to be his servants, and one day he will kill us""--and the maidens held up the blood-stained clothes--""and eat us, and there is no one to help us!"" ",19661,19927
270,And their tears burst out afresh at this horrible thought. ,19927,19986
271,"""I will rescue you,"" said Momotaro. ",19986,20022
272,"""Do not weep any more, only show me how I may get into the castle."" ",20022,20090
273,Then the two ladies led the way and showed Momotaro a little back door in the lowest part of the castle wall--so small that Momotaro could hardly crawl in. ,20090,20246
274,"The pheasant, who was all this time fighting hard, saw Momotaro and his little band rush in at the back. ",20246,20351
275,Momotaro's onslaught was so furious that the devils could not stand against him. ,20351,20432
276,"At first their foe had been a single bird, the pheasant, but now that Momotaro and the dog and the monkey had arrived they were bewildered, for the four enemies fought like a hundred, so strong were they. ",20432,20637
277,Some of the devils fell off the parapet of the castle and were dashed to pieces on the rocks beneath; ,20637,20739
278, others fell into the sea and were drowned; ,20738,20782
279, many were beaten to death by the three animals. ,20781,20830
280,The chief of the devils at last was the only one left. ,20830,20885
281,"He made up his mind to surrender, for he knew that his enemy was stronger than mortal man. ",20885,20976
282,"He came up humbly to Momotaro and threw down his iron bar, and kneeling down at the victor's feet he broke off the horns on his head in token of submission, for they were the sign of his strength and power. ",20976,21183
283,"""I am afraid of you,"" he said meekly. ",21183,21221
284,"""I cannot stand against you. ",21221,21250
285,"I will give you all the treasure hidden in this castle if you will spare my life!"" ",21250,21333
286,Momotaro laughed. ,21333,21351
287,"""It is not like you, big devil, to beg for mercy, is it? ",21351,21408
288,"I cannot spare your wicked life, however much you beg, for you have killed and tortured many people and robbed our country for many years."" ",21408,21548
289,Then Momotaro tied the devil chief up and gave him into the monkey's charge. ,21548,21625
290,"Having done this, he went into all the rooms of the castle and set the prisoners free and gathered together all the treasure he found. ",21625,21760
291,"The dog and the pheasant carried home the plunder, and thus Momotaro returned triumphantly to his home, taking with him the devil chief as a captive. ",21760,21910
292,"The two poor damsels, daughters of Daimios, and others whom the wicked demon had carried off to be his slaves, were taken safely to their own homes and delivered to their parents. ",21910,22090
293,"The whole country made a hero of Momotaro on his triumphant return, and rejoiced that the country was now freed from the robber devils who had been a terror of the land for a long time. ",22090,22276
294,"The old couple's joy was greater than ever, and the treasure Momotaro had brought home with him enabled them to live in peace and plenty to the end of their days.",22276,22439
