0,On the fifth day of the fifth month the festival of the Dragon Junk is held along the Yangtze-kiang. ,0,101
1,"A dragon is hollowed out of wood, painted with an armor of scales, and adorned with gold and bright colors. ",101,209
2,"A carved red railing surrounds this ship, and its sails and flags are made of silks and brocade. ",209,306
3,The after part of the vessel is called the dragon's tail. ,306,364
4,"It rises ten feet above the water, and a board which floats in the water is tied to it by means of a cloth. ",364,472
5,"Upon this board sit boys who turn somersaults, stand on their heads, and perform all sorts of tricks. ",472,574
6,"Yet, being so close to the water their danger is very great. ",574,635
7,"It is the custom, therefore, when a boy is hired for this purpose, to give his parents money before he is trained. ",635,750
8,"Then, if he falls into the water and is drowned, no one has him on their conscience. ",750,835
9,"Farther South the custom differs in so much that instead of boys, beautiful girls are chosen for this purpose. ",835,946
10,"In Dschen-Giang there once lived a widow named Dsiang, who had a son called Aduan. ",946,1029
11,"When he was no more than seven years of age he was extraordinarily skilful, and no other boy could equal him. ",1029,1139
12,"And his reputation increasing as he grew, he earned more and more money. ",1139,1212
13,So it happened that he was still called upon at the Dragon Junk Festival when he was already sixteen. ,1212,1314
14,But one day he fell into the water below the Gold Island and was drowned. ,1314,1388
15,"He was the only son of his mother, and she sorrowed over him, and that was the end of it. ",1388,1478
16,Yet Aduan did not know that he had been drowned. ,1478,1527
17,"He met two men who took him along with them, and he saw a new world in the midst of the waters of the Yellow River. ",1527,1643
18,"When he looked around, the waves of the river towered steeply about him like walls, and a palace was visible, in which sat a man wearing armor and a helmet. ",1643,1800
19,"His two companions said to him: ""That is the Prince of the Dragon's Cave!"" ",1800,1875
20,and bade him kneel. ,1875,1895
21,"The Prince of the Dragon's Cave seemed to be of a mild and kindly disposition and said: ""We can make use of such a skilful lad. ",1895,2023
22,"He may take part in the dance of the willow branches!"" ",2023,2078
23,So he was brought to a spot surrounded by extensive buildings. ,2078,2141
24,"He entered, and was greeted by a crowd of boys who were all about fourteen years of age. ",2141,2230
25,"An old woman came in and they all called out: ""This is Mother Hia!"" ",2230,2298
26,And she sat down and had Aduan show his tricks. ,2298,2346
27,"Then she taught him the dance of the flying thunders of Tsian-Tang River, and the music that calms the winds on the sea of Dung-Ting. ",2346,2480
28,"When the cymbals and kettledrums reechoed through all the courts, they deafened the ear. ",2480,2569
29,"Then, again, all the courts would fall silent. ",2569,2616
30,Mother Hia thought that Aduan would not be able to grasp everything the very first time; ,2616,2705
31, so she taught him with great patience. ,2704,2744
32,"But Aduan had understood everything from the first, and that pleased old Mother Hia. ",2744,2829
33,"""This boy,"" said she, ""equals our own Rose of Evening!"" ",2829,2885
34,The following day the Prince of the Dragon's Cave held a review of his dancers. ,2885,2965
35,"When all the dancers had assembled, the dance of the Ogres was danced first. ",2965,3042
36,Those who performed it all wore devil-masks and garments of scales. ,3042,3110
37,"They beat upon enormous cymbals, and their kettledrums were so large that four men could just about span them. ",3110,3221
38,"Their sound was like the sound of a mighty thunder, and the noise was so great that nothing else could be heard. ",3221,3334
39,"When the dance began, tremendous waves spouted up to the very skies, and then fell down again like star-glimmer which scatters in the air. ",3334,3473
40,"The Prince of the Dragon Cave hastily bade the dance cease, and had the dancers of the nightingale round step forth. ",3473,3590
41,These were all lovely young girls of sixteen. ,3590,3636
42,"They made a delicate music with flutes, so that the breeze blew and the roaring of the waves was stilled in a moment. ",3636,3754
43,"The water gradually became as quiet as a crystal world, transparent to its lowest depths. ",3754,3844
44,"When the nightingale dancers had finished, they withdrew and posted themselves in the western courtyard. ",3844,3949
45,Then came the turn of the swallow dancers. ,3949,3992
46,These were all little girls. ,3992,4021
47,"One among them, who was about fifteen years of age, danced the dance of the giving of flowers with flying sleeves and waving locks. ",4021,4153
48,"And as their garments fluttered, many-colored flowers dropped from their folds, and were caught up by the wind and whirled about the whole courtyard. ",4153,4303
49,"When the dance had ended, this dancer also went off with the rest of the girls to the western courtyard. ",4303,4408
50,"Aduan looked at her from out the corner of his eye, and fell deeply in love with her. ",4408,4494
51,"He asked his comrades who she might be and they told him she was named ""Rose of Evening."" ",4494,4584
52,But the willow-spray dancers were now called out. ,4584,4634
53,The Prince of the Dragon Cave was especially desirous of testing Aduan. ,4634,4706
54,"So Aduan danced alone, and he danced with joy or defiance according to the music. ",4706,4788
55,When he looked up and when he looked down his glances held the beat of the measure. ,4788,4872
56,"The Dragon Prince, enchanted with his skill, presented him with a garment of five colors, and gave him a carbuncle set in golden threads of fish-beard for a hair-jewel. ",4872,5041
57,"Aduan bowed his thanks for the gift, and then also hastened to the western courtyard. ",5041,5127
58,There all the dancers stood in rank and file. ,5127,5173
59,"Aduan could only look at Rose of Evening from a distance, but still Rose of Evening returned his glances. ",5173,5279
60,"After a time Aduan gradually slipped to the end of his file and Rose of Evening also drew near to him, so that they stood only a few feet away from each other. ",5279,5439
61,"But the strict rules allowed no confusion in the ranks, so they could only gaze and let their souls go out to each other. ",5439,5561
62,Now the butterfly dance followed the others. ,5561,5606
63,"This was danced by the boys and girls together, and the pairs were equal in size, age and the color of their garments. ",5606,5725
64,"When all the dances had ended, the dancers marched out with the goose-step. ",5725,5801
65,"The willow-spray dancers followed the swallow dancers, and Aduan hastened in advance of his company, while Rose of Evening lingered along after hers. ",5801,5951
66,"She turned her head, and when she spied Aduan she purposely let a coral pin fall from her hair. ",5951,6047
67,Aduan hastily hid it in his sleeve. ,6047,6083
68,"When he had returned, he was sick with longing, and could neither eat nor sleep. ",6083,6164
69,"Mother Hia brought him all sorts of dainties, looked after him three or four times a day, and stroked his forehead with loving care. ",6164,6297
70,But his illness did not yield in the least. ,6297,6341
71,"Mother Hia was unhappy, and yet helpless. ",6341,6383
72,"""The birthday of the King of the Wu River is at hand,"" said she. ",6383,6448
73,"""What is to be done?"" ",6448,6470
74,"In the twilight there came a boy, who sat down on the edge of Aduan's bed and chatted with him. ",6470,6566
75,"He belonged to the butterfly dancers, said he, and asked casually: ""Are you sick because of Rose of Evening?"" ",6566,6676
76,"Aduan, frightened, asked him how he came to guess it. ",6676,6730
77,"The other boy said, with a smile: ""Well, because Rose of Evening is in the same case as yourself."" ",6730,6829
78,"Disconcerted, Aduan sat up and begged the boy to advise him. ",6829,6890
79,"""Are you able to walk?"" ",6890,6914
80,asked the latter. ,6914,6932
81,"""If I exert myself,"" said Aduan, ""I think I could manage it."" ",6932,6994
82,So the boy led him to the South. ,6994,7027
83,"There he opened a gate and they turned the corner, to the West. ",7027,7091
84,"Once more the doors of the gate flew open, and now Aduan saw a lotus field about twenty acres in size. ",7091,7194
85,"The lotus flowers were all growing on level earth, and their leaves were as large as mats and their flowers like umbrellas. ",7194,7318
86,The fallen blossoms covered the ground beneath the stalks to the depth of a foot or more. ,7318,7408
87,"The boy led Aduan in and said, ""Now first of all sit down for a little while!"" ",7408,7487
88,Then he went away. ,7487,7506
89,After a time a beautiful girl thrust aside the lotus flowers and came into the open. ,7506,7591
90,It was Rose of Evening. ,7591,7615
91,"They looked at each other with happy timidity, and each told how each had longed for the other. ",7615,7711
92,And they also told each other of their former life. ,7711,7763
93,"Then they weighted the lotus-leaves with stones so that they made a cozy retreat, in which they could be together, and promised to meet each other there every evening. ",7763,7931
94,And then they parted. ,7931,7953
95,Aduan came back and his illness left him. ,7953,7995
96,From that time on he met Rose of Evening every day in the lotus field. ,7995,8066
97,After a few days had passed they had to accompany the Prince of the Dragon Cave to the birthday festival of the King of the Wu River. ,8066,8200
98,"The festival came to an end, and all the dancers returned home. ",8200,8264
99,"Only, the King had kept back Rose of Evening and one of the nightingale dancers to teach the girls in his castle. ",8264,8378
100,"Months passed and no news came from Rose of Evening, so that Aduan went about full of longing and despair. ",8378,8485
101,Now Mother Hia went every day to the castle of the god of the Wu River. ,8485,8557
102,"So Aduan told her that Rose of Evening was his cousin, and entreated her to take him along with her so that he could at least see her a single time. ",8557,8706
103,"So she took him along, and let him stay at the lodge-house of the river-god for a few days. ",8706,8798
104,But the indwellers of the castle were so strictly watched that he could not see Rose of Evening even a single time. ,8798,8914
105,Sadly Aduan went back again. ,8914,8943
106,"Another month passed and Aduan, filled with gloomy thoughts, wished that death might be his portion. ",8943,9044
107,"One day Mother Hia came to him full of pity, and began to sympathize with him. ",9044,9123
108,"""What a shame,"" said she, ""that Rose of Evening has cast herself into the river!"" ",9123,9205
109,"Aduan was extremely frightened, and his tears flowed resistlessly. ",9205,9272
110,"He tore his beautiful garments, took his gold and his pearls, and went out with the sole idea of following his beloved in death. ",9272,9401
111,"Yet the waters of the river stood up before him like walls, and no matter how often he ran against them, head down, they always flung him back. ",9401,9545
112,"He did not dare return, since he feared he might be questioned about his festival garments, and severely punished because he had ruined them. ",9545,9687
113,"So he stood there and knew not what to do, while the perspiration ran down to his ankles. ",9687,9777
114,"Suddenly, at the foot of the water-wall he saw a tall tree. ",9777,9837
115,"Like a monkey he climbed up to its very top, and then, with all his might, he shot into the waves. ",9837,9936
116,"And then, without being wet, he found himself suddenly swimming on the surface of the river. ",9936,10029
117,Unexpectedly the world of men rose up once more before his dazzled eyes. ,10029,10102
118,"He swam to the shore, and as he walked along the river-bank, his thoughts went back to his old mother. ",10102,10205
119,He took a ship and traveled home. ,10205,10239
120,"When he reached the village, it seemed to him as though all the houses in it belonged to another world. ",10239,10343
121,"The following morning he entered his mother's house, and as he did so, heard a girl's voice beneath the window saying: ""Your son has come back again!"" ",10343,10494
122,"The voice sounded like the voice of Rose of Evening, and when she came to greet him at his mother's side, sure enough, it was Rose of Evening herself. ",10494,10645
123,And in that hour the joy of these two who were so fond of each other overcame all their sorrow. ,10645,10741
124,"But in the mother's mind sorrow and doubt, terror and joy mingled in constant succession in a thousand different ways. ",10741,10860
125,"When Rose of Evening had been in the palace of the river-king, and had come to realize that she would never see Aduan again, she determined to die, and flung herself into the waters of the stream. ",10860,11057
126,"But she was carried to the surface, and the waves carried and cradled her till a ship came by and took her aboard. ",11057,11172
127,They asked whence she came. ,11172,11200
128,"Now Rose of Evening had originally been a celebrated singing girl of Wu, who had fallen into the river and whose body had never been found. ",11200,11340
129,"So she thought to herself that, after all, she could not return to her old life again. ",11340,11427
130,"So she answered: ""Madame Dsiang, in Dschen-Giang is my mother-in-law."" ",11427,11498
131,Then the travelers took passage for her in a ship which brought her to the place she had mentioned. ,11498,11598
132,"The widow Dsiang first said she must be mistaken, but the girl insisted that there was no mistake, and told Aduan's mother her whole story. ",11598,11738
133,"Yet, though the latter was charmed by her surpassing loveliness, she feared that Rose of Evening was too young to live a widow's life. ",11738,11873
134,"But the girl was respectful and industrious, and when she saw that poverty ruled in her new home, she took her pearls and sold them for a high price. ",11873,12023
135,Aduan's old mother was greatly pleased to see how seriously the girl took her duties. ,12023,12109
136,Now that Aduan had returned again Rose of Evening could not control her joy. ,12109,12186
137,"And even Aduan's old mother cherished the hope that, after all, perhaps her son had not died. ",12186,12280
138,"She secretly dug up her son's grave, yet all his bones were still lying in it. ",12280,12359
139,So she questioned Aduan. ,12359,12384
140,"And then, for the first time, the latter realized that he was a departed spirit. ",12384,12465
141,Then he feared that Rose of Evening might regard him with disgust because he was no longer a human being. ,12465,12571
142,"So he ordered his mother on no account to speak of it, and this his mother promised. ",12571,12656
143,Then she spread the report in the village that the body which had been found in the river had not been that of her son at all. ,12656,12783
144,"Yet she could not rid herself of the fear that, since Aduan was a departed spirit, heaven might refuse to send him a child. ",12783,12907
145,"In spite of her fear, however, she was able to hold a grandson in her arms in course of time. ",12907,13001
146,"When she looked at him, he was no different from other children, and then her cup of joy was filled to overflowing. ",13001,13117
147,Rose of Evening gradually became aware of the fact that Aduan was not really a human being. ,13117,13209
148,"""Why did you not tell me at once?"" ",13209,13244
149,said she. ,6438,6448
150,"""Departed spirits who wear the garments of the dragon castle, surround themselves with a soul-casing so heavy in texture that they can no longer be distinguished from the living. ",13254,13433
151,"And if one can obtain the lime made of dragon-horn which is in the castle, then the bones may be glued together in such wise that flesh and blood will grow over them again. ",13433,13606
152,"What a pity that we could not obtain the lime while we were there!"" ",13606,13674
153,"Aduan sold his pearl, for which a merchant from foreign parts gave him an enormous sum. ",13674,13762
154,Thus his family grew very wealthy. ,13762,13797
155,"Once, on his mother's birthday, he danced with his wife and sang, in order to please her. ",13797,13887
156,The news reached the castle of the Dragon Prince and he thought to carry off Rose of Evening by force. ,13887,13990
157,"But Aduan, alarmed, went to the Prince, and declared that both he and his wife were departed spirits. ",13990,14092
158,"They examined him and since he cast no shadow, his word was taken, and he was not robbed of Rose of Evening.",14092,14201
