0,"There were formerly a king and a queen, who were so sorry that they had no children; ",0,85
1, so sorry that it cannot be expressed. ,84,123
2,They went to all the waters in the world; ,123,165
3," vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried, and all to no purpose. ",164,228
4,"At last, however, the Queen had a daughter. ",228,272
5,There was a very fine christening; ,272,307
6," and the Princess had for her god-mothers all the fairies they could find in the whole kingdom (they found seven), that every one of them might give her a gift, as was the custom of fairies in those days. ",306,511
7,By this means the Princess had all the perfections imaginable. ,511,574
8,"After the ceremonies of the christening were over, all the company returned to the King's palace, where was prepared a great feast for the fairies. ",574,722
9,"There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife, and fork, all of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies. ",722,899
10,"But as they were all sitting down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy, whom they had not invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted. ",899,1144
11,"The King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case of gold as the others, because they had only seven made for the seven fairies. ",1144,1291
12,"The old Fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some threats between her teeth. ",1291,1376
13,One of the young fairies who sat by her overheard how she grumbled; ,1376,1444
14," and, judging that she might give the little Princess some unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from table, and hid herself behind the hangings, that she might speak last, and repair, as much as she could, the evil which the old Fairy might intend. ",1443,1696
15,In the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the Princess. ,1696,1772
16,The youngest gave her for gift that she should be the most beautiful person in the world; ,1772,1862
17," the next, that she should have the wit of an angel; ",1861,1914
18," the third, that she should have a wonderful grace in everything she did; ",1913,1987
19," the fourth, that she should dance perfectly well; ",1986,2037
20," the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; ",2036,2089
21," and the sixth, that she should play all kinds of music to the utmost perfection. ",2088,2170
22,"The old Fairy's turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite than age, she said that the Princess should have her hand pierced with a spindle and die of the wound. ",2170,2343
23,"This terrible gift made the whole company tremble, and everybody fell a-crying. ",2343,2423
24,"At this very instant the young Fairy came out from behind the hangings, and spake these words aloud: ""Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your daughter shall not die of this disaster. ",2423,2613
25,"It is true, I have no power to undo entirely what my elder has done. ",2613,2682
26,The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; ,2682,2740
27," but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a profound sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the expiration of which a king's son shall come and awake her."" ",2739,2907
28,"The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old Fairy, caused immediately proclamation to be made, whereby everybody was forbidden, on pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle, or to have so much as any spindle in their houses. ",2907,3150
29,"About fifteen or sixteen years after, the King and Queen being gone to one of their houses of pleasure, the young Princess happened one day to divert herself in running up and down the palace; ",3150,3343
30," when going up from one apartment to another, she came into a little room on the top of the tower, where a good old woman, alone, was spinning with her spindle. ",3342,3503
31,This good woman had never heard of the King's proclamation against spindles. ,3503,3580
32,"""What are you doing there, goody?"" ",3580,3615
33,said the Princess. ,3615,3634
34,"""I am spinning, my pretty child,"" said the old woman, who did not know who she was. ",3634,3718
35,"""Ha!"" ",3718,3724
36,"said the Princess, ""this is very pretty; ",3724,3765
37, how do you do it? ,3764,3783
38,"Give it to me, that I may see if I can do so."" ",3783,3830
39,"She had no sooner taken it into her hand than, whether being very hasty at it, somewhat unhandy, or that the decree of the Fairy had so ordained it, it ran into her hand, and she fell down in a swoon. ",3830,4031
40,"The good old woman, not knowing very well what to do in this affair, cried out for help. ",4031,4120
41,People came in from every quarter in great numbers; ,4120,4172
42," they threw water upon the Princess's face, unlaced her, struck her on the palms of her hands, and rubbed her temples with Hungary-water; ",4171,4309
43, but nothing would bring her to herself. ,4308,4349
44,"And now the King, who came up at the noise, bethought himself of the prediction of the fairies, and, judging very well that this must necessarily come to pass, since the fairies had said it, caused the Princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and to be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver. ",4349,4679
45,"One would have taken her for a little angel, she was so very beautiful; ",4679,4751
46, for her swooning away had not diminished one bit of her complexion; ,4750,4819
47," her cheeks were carnation, and her lips were coral; ",4818,4871
48," indeed, her eyes were shut, but she was heard to breathe softly, which satisfied those about her that she was not dead. ",4870,4991
49,"The King commanded that they should not disturb her, but let her sleep quietly till her hour of awaking was come. ",4991,5105
50,"The good Fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a hundred years was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues off, when this accident befell the Princess; ",5105,5286
51," but she was instantly informed of it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that is, boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground in one stride. ",5285,5459
52,"The Fairy came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour after, in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons. ",5459,5567
53,"The King handed her out of the chariot, and she approved everything he had done, but as she had very great foresight, she thought when the Princess should awake she might not know what to do with herself, being all alone in this old palace; ",5567,5808
54," and this was what she did: she touched with her wand everything in the palace (except the King and Queen)-governesses, maids of honor, ladies of the bedchamber, gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, undercooks, scullions, guards, with their beefeaters, pages, footmen; ",5807,6077
55," she likewise touched all the horses which were in the stables, pads as well as others, the great dogs in the outward court and pretty little Mopsey too, the Princess's little spaniel, which lay by her on the bed. ",6076,6290
56,"Immediately upon her touching them they all fell asleep, that they might not awake before their mistress and that they might be ready to wait upon her when she wanted them. ",6290,6463
57,"The very spits at the fire, as full as they could hold of partridges and pheasants, did fall asleep also. ",6463,6569
58,All this was done in a moment. ,6569,6600
59,Fairies are not long in doing their business. ,6600,6646
60,"And now the King and the Queen, having kissed their dear child without waking her, went out of the palace and put forth a proclamation that nobody should dare to come near it. ",6646,6822
61,"This, however, was not necessary, for in a quarter of an hour's time there grew up all round about the park such a vast number of trees, great and small, bushes and brambles, twining one within another, that neither man nor beast could pass through; ",6822,7072
62, so that nothing could be seen but the very top of the towers of the palace; ,7071,7148
63," and that, too, not unless it was a good way off. ",7147,7197
64,Nobody; ,7197,7205
65," doubted but the Fairy gave herein a very extraordinary sample of her art, that the Princess, while she continued sleeping, might have nothing to fear from any curious people. ",7204,7380
66,"When a hundred years were gone and passed the son of the King then reigning, and who was of another family from that of the sleeping Princess, being gone a-hunting on that side of the country, asked: What those towers were which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood? ",7380,7653
67,Everyone answered according as they had heard. ,7653,7700
68,"Some said: That it was a ruinous old castle, haunted by spirits. ",7700,7765
69,"Others, That all the sorcerers and witches of the country kept there their sabbath or night's meeting. ",7765,7868
70,"The common opinion was: That an ogre lived there, and that he carried thither all the little children he could catch, that he might eat them up at his leisure, without anybody being able to follow him, as having himself only the power to pass through the wood. ",7868,8129
71,"The Prince was at a stand, not knowing what to believe, when a very good countryman spake to him thus: ""May it please your royal highness, it is now about fifty years since I heard from my father, who heard my grandfather say, that there was then in this castle a princess, the most beautiful was ever seen; ",8129,8437
72," that she must sleep there a hundred years, and should be waked by a king's son, for whom she was reserved."" ",8436,8545
73,"The young Prince was all on fire at these words, believing, without weighing the matter, that he could put an end to this rare adventure; ",8545,8683
74," and, pushed on by love and honor, resolved that moment to look into it. ",8682,8755
75,"Scarce had he advanced toward the wood when all the great trees, the bushes, and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through; ",8755,8893
76, he walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue which he went into; ,8892,8982
77," and what a little surprised him was that he saw none of his people could follow him, because the trees closed again as soon as he had passed through them. ",8981,9137
78,"However, he did not cease from continuing his way; ",9137,9188
79, a young and amorous prince is always valiant. ,9187,9234
80,"He came into a spacious outward court, where everything he saw might have frozen the most fearless person with horror. ",9234,9353
81,There reigned all over a most frightful silence; ,9353,9402
82," the image of death everywhere showed itself, and there was nothing to be seen but stretched-out bodies of men and animals, all seeming to be dead. ",9401,9549
83,"He, however, very well knew, by the ruby faces and pimpled noses of the beefeaters, that they were only asleep; ",9549,9661
84," and their goblets, wherein still remained some drops of wine, showed plainly that they fell asleep in their cups. ",9660,9775
85,"He then crossed a court paved with marble, went up the stairs and came into the guard chamber, where guards were standing in their ranks, with their muskets upon their shoulders, and snoring as loud as they could. ",9775,9989
86,"After that he went through several rooms full of gentlemen and ladies, all asleep, some standing, others sitting. ",9989,10103
87,"At last he came into a chamber all gilded with gold, where he saw upon a bed, the curtains of which were all open, the finest sight was ever beheld-a princess, who appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and whose bright and, in a manner, resplendent beauty, had somewhat in it divine. ",10103,10403
88,"He approached with trembling and admiration, and fell down before her upon his knees. ",10403,10489
89,"And now, as the enchantment was at an end, the Princess awaked, and looking on him with eyes more tender than the first view might seem to admit of: ""Is it you, my Prince?"" ",10489,10662
90,said she to him. ,10662,10679
91,"""You have waited a long while."" ",10679,10711
92,"The Prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner in which they were spoken, knew not how to show his joy and gratitude; ",10711,10850
93, he assured her that he loved her better than he did himself; ,10849,10911
94," their discourse was not well connected, they did weep more than talk-little eloquence, a great deal of love. ",10910,11020
95,"He was more at a loss than she, and we need not wonder at it; ",11020,11082
96, she had time to think on what to say to him; ,11081,11127
97," for it is very probable (though history mentions nothing of it) that the good Fairy, during so long a sleep, had given her very agreeable dreams. ",11126,11273
98,"In short, they talked four hours together, and yet they said not half what they had to say. ",11273,11365
99,In the meanwhile all the palace awaked; ,11365,11405
100," everyone thought upon their particular business, and as all of them were not in love they were ready to die for hunger. ",11404,11525
101,"The chief lady of honor, being as sharp set as other folks, grew very impatient, and told the Princess aloud that supper was served up. ",11525,11661
102,The Prince helped the Princess to rise; ,11661,11701
103," she was entirely dressed, and very magnificently, but his royal highness took care not to tell her that she was dressed like his great-grandmother, and had a point band peeping over a high collar; ",11700,11898
104, she looked not a bit less charming and beautiful for all that. ,11897,11961
105,"They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped, and were served by the Princess's officers, the violins and hautboys played old tunes, but very excellent, though it was now above a hundred years since they had played; ",11961,12200
106," and after supper, without losing any time, the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief lady of honor drew the curtains. ",12199,12349
107,They had but very little sleep-the Princess had no occasion; ,12349,12410
108," and the Prince left her next morning to return to the city, where his father must needs have been in pain for him. ",12409,12525
109,"The Prince told him: That he lost his way in the forest as he was hunting, and that he had lain in the cottage of a charcoal-burner, who gave him cheese and brown bread. ",12525,12695
110,"The King, his father, who was a good man, believed him; ",12695,12751
111, but his mother could not be persuaded it was true; ,12750,12802
112," and seeing that he went almost every day a-hunting, and that he always had some excuse ready for so doing, though he had lain out three or four nights together, she began to suspect that he was married, for he lived with the Princess above two whole years, and had by her two children, the eldest of which, who was a daughter, was named Morning, and the youngest, who was a son, they called Day, because he was a great deal handsomer and more beautiful than his sister. ",12801,13272
113,"The Queen spoke several times to her son, to inform herself after what manner he did pass his time, and that in this he ought in duty to satisfy her. ",13272,13422
114,But he never dared to trust her with his secret; ,13422,13471
115," he feared her, though he loved her, for she was of the race of the Ogres, and the King would never have married her had it not been for her vast riches; ",13470,13624
116," it was even whispered about the Court that she had Ogreish inclinations, and that, whenever she saw little children passing by, she had all the difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them. ",13623,13820
117,And so the Prince would never tell her one word. ,13820,13869
118,"But when the King was dead, which happened about two years afterward, and he saw himself lord and master, he openly declared his marriage; ",13869,14008
119, and he went in great ceremony to conduct his Queen to the palace. ,14007,14074
120,"They made a magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two children.",14074,14164
