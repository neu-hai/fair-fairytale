0,'Phew!' ,0,8
1,cried Lisa. ,8,20
2,'Ugh!' ,20,27
3,cried Aina. ,27,39
4,'What now?' ,39,51
5,cried the big sister. ,51,73
6,'A worm!' ,73,83
7,cried Lisa. ,8,20
8,'On the raspberry!' ,95,115
9,cried Aina. ,27,39
10,'Kill it!' ,127,138
11,cried Otto. ,138,150
12,'What a fuss over a poor little worm!' ,150,189
13,said the big sister scornfully. ,189,221
14,"'Yes, when we had cleaned the raspberries so carefully,' said Lisa. ",221,289
15,"'It crept out from that very large one,' put in Aina. ",289,343
16,"'And supposing someone had eaten the raspberry,' said Lisa. ",343,403
17,"'Then they would have eaten the worm, too,' said Aina. ",403,458
18,"'Well, what harm?' ",458,477
19,said Otto. ,477,488
20,'Eat a worm!' ,488,502
21,cried Lisa. ,8,20
22,'And kill him with one bite!' ,514,544
23,murmured Aina. ,544,559
24,'Just think of it!' ,559,579
25,said Otto laughing. ,579,599
26,"'Now it is crawling on the table,' cried Aina again. ",599,652
27,'Blow it away!' ,652,668
28,said the big sister. ,668,689
29,'Tramp on it!' ,689,704
30,laughed Otto. ,704,718
31,"But Lisa took a raspberry leaf, swept the worm carefully on to the leaf and carried it out into the yard. ",718,824
32,"Then Aina noticed that a sparrow sitting on the fence was just ready to pounce on the poor little worm, so she took up the leaf, carried it out into the wood and hid it under a raspberry bush where the greedy sparrow could not find it. ",824,1060
33,"Yes, and what more is there to tell about a raspberry worm? ",1060,1120
34,Who would give three straws for such a miserable little thing? ,1120,1183
35,"Yes, but who would not like to live in such a pretty home as it lives in; ",1183,1257
36," in such a fresh fragrant dark-red cottage, far away in the quiet wood among flowers and green leaves! ",1256,1359
37,"Now it was just dinner time, so they all had a dinner of raspberries and cream. ",1359,1439
38,"'Be careful with the sugar, Otto,' said the big sister; ",1439,1495
39," but Otto's plate was like a snowdrift in winter, with just a little red under the snow. ",1494,1583
40,Soon after dinner the big sister said: 'Now we have eaten up the raspberries and we have none left to make preserve for the winter; ,1583,1715
41," it would be fine if we could get two baskets full of berries, then we could clean them this evening, and to-morrow we could cook them in the big preserving pan, and then we should have raspberry jam to eat on our bread!' ",1714,1936
42,"'Come, let us go to the wood and pick,' said Lisa. ",1936,1987
43,"'Yes, let us,' said Aina. ",1987,2013
44,'You take the yellow basket and I will take the green one.' ,2013,2073
45,"'Don't get lost, and come back safely in the evening,' said the big sister. ",2073,2149
46,"'Greetings to the raspberry worm,' said Otto, mockingly. ",2149,2206
47,'Next time I meet him I shall do him the honour of eating him up.' ,2206,2273
48,So Aina and Lisa went off to the wood. ,2273,2312
49,Ah! ,2312,2316
50,"how delightful it was there, how beautiful! ",2316,2360
51,"It was certainly tiresome sometimes climbing over the fallen trees, and getting caught in the branches, and waging war with the juniper bushes and the midges, but what did that matter? ",2360,2545
52,"The girls climbed well in their short dresses, and soon they were deep in the wood. ",2545,2629
53,"There were plenty of bilberries and elder berries, but no raspberries. ",2629,2700
54,"They wandered on and on, and at last they came... No, it could not be true!... ",2700,2779
55,they came to a large raspberry wood. ,2779,2816
56,"The wood had been on fire once, and now raspberry bushes had grown up, and there were raspberry bushes and raspberry bushes as far as the eye could see. ",2816,2969
57,"Every bush was weighted to the ground with the largest, dark red, ripe raspberries, such a wealth of berries as two little berry pickers had never found before! ",2969,3130
58,"Lisa picked, Aina picked. ",3130,3156
59,"Lisa ate, Aina ate, and in a little while their baskets were full. ",3156,3223
60,"'Now we shall go home,' said Aina. ",3223,3258
61,"'No, let us gather a few more,' said Lisa. ",3258,3301
62,"So they put the baskets down on the ground and began to fill their pinafores, and it was not long before their pinafores were full, too. ",3301,3438
63,"'Now we shall go home,' said Lina. ",3438,3473
64,"'Yes, now we shall go home,' said Aina. ",3473,3513
65,Both girls took a basket in one hand and held up her apron in the other and then turned to go home. ,3513,3613
66,But that was easier said than done. ,3613,3649
67,"They had never been so far in the great wood before, they could not find any road nor path, and soon the girls noticed that they had lost their way. ",3649,3798
68,"The worst of it was that the shadows of the tress were becoming so long in the evening sunlight, the birds were beginning to fly home, and the day was closing in. ",3798,3961
69,"At last the sun went down behind the pine tops, and it was cool and dusky in the great wood. ",3961,4054
70,"The girls became anxious but went steadily on, expecting that the wood would soon end, and that they would see the smoke from the chimneys of their home. ",4054,4208
71,After they had wandered on for a long time it began to grow dark. ,4208,4274
72,"At last they reached a great plain overgrown with bushes, and when they looked around them, they saw, as much as they could in the darkness, that they were among the same beautiful raspberry bushes from which they had picked their baskets and their aprons full. ",4274,4536
73,Then they were so tired that they sat down on a stone and began to cry. ,4536,4608
74,"'I am so hungry,' said Lisa. ",4608,4637
75,"'Yes,' said Aina, 'if we had only two good meat sandwiches now.' ",4637,4702
76,"As she said that, she felt something in her hand, and when she looked down, she saw a large sandwich of bread and chicken, and at the same time Lisa said: 'How very queer! ",4702,4874
77,I have a sandwich in my hand.' ,4874,4905
78,"'And I, too,' said Aina. ",4905,4930
79,'Will you dare to eat it?' ,4930,4957
80,"'Of course I will,' said Lisa. ",4957,4988
81,"'Ah, if we only had a good glass of milk now!' ",4988,5035
82,"Just as she said that she felt a large glass of milk between her fingers, and at the same time Aina cried out, 'Lisa! ",5035,5153
83,Lisa! ,5147,5153
84,I have a glass of milk in my hand! ,5159,5194
85,Isn't it queer?' ,5194,5211
86,"The girls, however, were very hungry, so they ate and drank with a good appetite. ",5211,5293
87,"When they had finished Aina yawned, stretched out her arms and said: 'Oh, if only we had a nice soft bed to sleep on now!' ",5293,5416
88,"Scarcely had she spoken before she felt a nice soft bed by her side, and there beside Lisa was one too. ",5416,5520
89,"This seemed to the girls more and more wonderful, but tired and sleepy as they were, they thought no more about it, but crept into the little beds, drew the coverlets over their heads and were soon asleep. ",5520,5726
90,"When they awoke the sun was high in the heavens, the wood was beautiful in the summer morning, and the birds were flying about in the branches and the tree tops. ",5726,5888
91,At first the girls were filled with wonder when they saw that they had slept in the wood among the raspberry bushes. ,5888,6005
92,"They looked at each other, they looked at their beds, which were of the finest flax covered over with leaves and moss. ",6005,6124
93,"At last Lisa said: 'Are you awake, Aina?' ",6124,6166
94,"'Yes,' said Aina. ",6166,6184
95,"'But I am still dreaming,' said Lisa. ",6184,6222
96,"'No,' said Aina, 'but there is certainly some good fairy living among these raspberry bushes. ",6222,6316
97,"Ah, if we had only a hot cup of coffee now, and a nice piece of white bread to dip into it!' ",6316,6409
98,"Scarcely had she finished speaking when she saw beside her a little silver tray with a gilt coffee-pot, two cups of rare porcelain, a sugar basin of fine crystal, silver sugar tongs, and some good fresh white bread. ",6409,6625
99,"The girls poured out the beautiful coffee, put in the cream and sugar, and tasted it; ",6625,6711
100, never in their lives had they drunk such beautiful coffee. ,6710,6770
101,"'Now I should like to know very much who has given us all this,' said Lisa gratefully. ",6770,6857
102,"'I have, my little girls,' said a voice just then from the bushes. ",6857,6924
103,"The children looked round wonderingly, and saw a little kind-looking old man, in a white coat and a red cap, limping out from among the bushes, for he was lame in his left foot; ",6924,7102
104," neither Lisa nor Aina could utter a word, they were so filled with surprise. ",7101,7179
105,"'Don't be afraid, little girls,' he said smiling kindly at them; ",7179,7244
106, he could not laugh properly because his mouth was crooked. ,7243,7303
107,'Welcome to my kingdom! ,7303,7327
108,Have you slept well and eaten well and drunk well?' ,7327,7379
109,he asked. ,7379,7389
110,"'Yes, indeed we have,' said both the girls, 'but tell us...' and they wanted to ask who the old man was, but were afraid to. ",7389,7514
111,"'I will tell you who I am,' said the old man; ",7514,7560
112," 'I am the raspberry king, who reigns over all this kingdom of raspberry bushes, and I have lived here for more than a thousand years. ",7559,7694
113,"But the great spirit who rules over the woods, and the sea, and the sky, did not want me to become proud of my royal power and my long life. ",7694,7835
114,"Therefore he decreed that one day in every hundred years I should change into a little raspberry worm, and live in that weak and helpless form from sunrise to sunset. ",7835,8002
115,"During that time my life is dependent on the little worm's life, so that a bird can eat me, a child can pick me with the berries and trample under foot my thousand years of life. ",8002,8181
116,"Now yesterday was just my transformation day, and I was taken with the raspberry and would have been trampled to death if you had not saved my life. ",8181,8330
117,"Until sunset I lay helpless in the grass, and when I was swept away from your table I twisted one of my feet, and my mouth became crooked with terror; ",8330,8481
118," but when evening came and I could take my own form again, I looked for you to thank you and reward you. ",8480,8585
119,"Then I found you both here in my kingdom, and tried to meet you both as well as I could without frightening you. ",8585,8698
120,Now I will send a bird from my wood to show you the way home. ,8698,8760
121,"Good-bye, little children, thank you for your kind hearts; ",8760,8819
122, the raspberry king can show that he is not ungrateful.' ,8818,8875
123,"The children shook hands with the old man and thanked him, feeling very glad that they had saved the little raspberry worm. ",8875,8999
124,"They were just going when the old man turned round, smiled mischievously with his crooked mouth, and said: 'Greetings to Otto from me, and tell him when I meet him again I shall do him the honour of eating him up.' ",8999,9214
125,"'Oh, please don't do that,' cried both the girls, very frightened. ",9214,9281
126,"'Well, for your sake I will forgive him,' said the old man, 'I am not revengeful. ",9281,9363
127,"Greetings to Otto and tell him that he may expect a gift from me, too. ",9363,9434
128,Good-bye.' ,9434,9445
129,"The two girls, light of heart, now took their berries and ran off through the wood after the bird; ",9445,9544
130," and soon it began to get lighter in the wood and they wondered how they could have lost their way yesterday, it seemed so easy and plain now. ",9543,9686
131,One can imagine what joy there was when the two reached home. ,9686,9748
132,"Everyone had been looking for them, and the big sister had not been able to sleep, for she thought the wolves had eaten them up. ",9748,9877
133,Otto met them; ,9877,9892
134," he had a basket in his hand and said: 'Look, here is something that an old man has just left for you.' ",9891,9995
135,"When the girls looked into the basket they saw a pair of most beautiful bracelets of precious stones, dark red, and made in the shape of a ripe raspberry and with an inscription: 'To Lisa and Aina';",9995,10193
136," beside them there was a diamond breast pin in the shape of a raspberry worm: on it was inscribed 'Otto, never destroy the helpless!' ",10193,10327
137,"Otto felt rather ashamed: he quite understood what it meant, but he thought that the old man's revenge was a noble one. ",10327,10447
138,"The raspberry king had also remembered the big sister, for when she went in to set the table for dinner, she found eleven big baskets of most beautiful raspberries, and no one knew how they had come there, but everyone guessed. ",10447,10675
139,"And so there was such a jam-making as had never been seen before, and if you like to go and help in it, you might perhaps get a little, for they must surely be making jam still to this very day.",10675,10870
