0,It was very pleasant out in the country. ,0,41
1,"It was summer time, the corn was yellow, the oats green, the hay was stacked down in the green meadows, and there the stork walked about on his long red legs and talked Egyptian. ",41,220
2,He had learnt the language from his mother. ,220,264
3,"Round the fields and meadows there were large woods and within them deep lakes: indeed, it was pleasant out in the country. ",264,388
4,"Full in the sunshine, an old manor house stood, surrounded by a deep moat, and from the base of the walls right down to the water great dock plants grew--so tall that a little child could stand upright under the largest of them. ",388,617
5,It was as lonely in among them as in the thickest wood; ,617,673
6, and there a Duck was sitting on her nest. ,672,715
7,"She had got to hatch out her little Ducklings, but by this time she was well nigh tired out, they took so long about it, and she had very few callers. ",715,866
8,The other Ducks preferred swimming about the moat to coming up and sitting under a dock-leaf to chat with her. ,866,977
9,"At last, one egg after another cracked, and said: ""Pip! ",977,1033
10,"pip!"" ",1033,1039
11,All the egg-yolks had come to life and were sticking their heads out. ,1039,1109
12,"""Quack, quack!"" ",1109,1125
13,"said she, and they said it too, as well as they could, and looked all round them beneath the green leaves; ",1125,1232
14," and their mother let them look as much as they liked, for green is good for the eyes. ",1231,1318
15,"""What a big place the world is,"" said all the young ones: for to be sure they had a great deal more room now than when they lay in the egg. ",1318,1458
16,"""Do you suppose this is all the world?"" ",1458,1498
17,said their mother; ,1498,1517
18," ""why, it stretches out far beyond the other side of the garden, right into the parson's field--but I've never been there. ",1516,1639
19,"You're all there, I suppose?"" ",1639,1669
20,and she got up. ,1669,1685
21,"""No, that's not all; ",1685,1706
22, there lies the biggest egg still. ,1705,1740
23,How long will it take? ,1740,1763
24,"I'm really almost sick of it,"" and with that she sat down again. ",1763,1828
25,"""Well, how goes it?"" ",1828,1849
26,asked an elderly Duck who came to call on her. ,1849,1896
27,"""Oh, this one egg takes a dreadful long time,"" said the sitting Duck; ",1896,1966
28," ""it won't break. ",1965,1983
29,But just you look at the others! ,1983,2016
30,They are the sweetest Ducklings I've ever seen; ,2016,2064
31," they're all just like their wretch of a father, who never comes to see me."" ",2063,2140
32,"""Let me look at the egg that won't hatch,"" said the old Duck; ",2140,2202
33," ""you may be sure that's a turkey's egg. ",2201,2242
34,"I was made a fool of once that way, and I had my share of trouble and anxiety with the young ones, I can tell you, for they are afraid of the water. ",2242,2391
35,I couldn't get them to go in! ,2391,2421
36,"I quacked and I pecked, but it was no good. ",2421,2465
37,Let me see the egg. ,2465,2485
38,"Ah, yes, that's a turkey's egg; ",2485,2517
39," you just let it lie and teach the rest to swim."" ",2516,2566
40,"""Oh, I'll just sit on it a bit longer,"" said the Duck. ",2566,2621
41,"""As I've sat so long, I may as well give it a Whitsun week!"" ",2621,2682
42,"[1] ""Just as you please,"" said the old Duck, and walked off. ",2682,2743
43,At last the big egg opened. ,2743,2771
44,"""Pip! ",1027,1033
45,"pip!"" ",1033,1039
46,"said the young one, scrambling out; ",2783,2819
47, he was very big and ugly. ,2818,2845
48,"The Duck looked at him: ""That's a fearfully big Duckling, that is,"" she said. ",2845,2923
49,"""None of the others look like that. ",2923,2959
50,I suppose it can't be a turkey poult! ,2959,2997
51,"Well, we'll soon see; ",2997,3019
52," into the water he shall go, if I have to kick him out myself."" ",3018,3082
53,"Next day the weather was perfectly delicious: the sun shone all over the green docks, and the mother Duck and all her family came out, and down to the moat. ",3082,3239
54,Splash! ,3239,3247
55,Into the water went she. ,3247,3272
56,"""Quack, quack!"" ",1109,1125
57,"she said, and one Duckling after another plumped in. ",3288,3341
58,"The water went over their heads, but they were up again in a moment and swam beautifully. ",3341,3431
59,"Their legs worked of themselves, and now they were all out in the water, and even the ugly grey one was swimming with them. ",3431,3555
60,"""No, no, that's no turkey,"" she said. ",3555,3593
61,"""Look how nicely he uses his legs, and how well he holds himself up. ",3593,3662
62,That's my own child! ,3662,3683
63,He's really quite handsome if you look at him properly. ,3683,3739
64,"Quack, quack!""",1110,1124
65,"Come along with me and I'll take you out into the world and introduce you to the duck-yard, but mind and keep close to me so that nobody can tread on you, and do look out for the cat."" ",3753,3938
66,So they went into the duck-yard. ,3938,3971
67,"There was a terrible commotion there, for two families were quarrelling over an eel's head--which the cat got after all. ",3971,4092
68,"""Look, that's the way the world goes,"" said the mother Duck--her beak watering a little, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. ",4092,4230
69,"""Now then, use your legs,"" she said; ",4230,4267
70," ""mind and look alive, and stoop your necks to the old Duck over there, she's the most distinguished person here; ",4266,4380
71," she's of Spanish descent, so she's something special, and you see she's got a red rag round her leg. ",4379,4481
72,"That is an extraordinarily splendid thing, the greatest distinction any duck can have; ",4481,4568
73," it means that people can't do without her, and she must be recognized by animals and men alike. ",4567,4664
74,"Now then, look alive! ",4664,4686
75,Don't turn your toes in! ,4686,4711
76,"A duckling that's properly brought up keeps its legs wide apart, like father and mother. ",4711,4800
77,Look here! ,4800,4811
78,Now then! ,4811,4821
79,"Make a bow and say quack."" ",4821,4848
80,So they did; ,4848,4861
81," but the other ducks round them looked at them and said, quite loud, ""Look there! ",4860,4942
82,"Now we've got to have all this mob on the top of us, as if there weren't enough of us already; ",4942,5037
83, and poof! ,5036,5047
84,what an object that duckling is! ,5047,5080
85,"We can't stand him"";",5080,5100
86, and a duck rushed at him and bit him in the neck. ,5100,5151
87,"""Let him be,"" said his mother; ",5151,5182
88," ""he isn't doing any harm."" ",5181,5209
89,"""Yes, but he's too big and odd altogether,"" said the duck who had bitten him; ",5209,5287
90," ""so he's got to be smacked."" ",5286,5316
91,"""Those are pretty ducklings that mother has,"" said the old Duck with the rag on her leg; ",5316,5405
92," ""all quite pretty except that one. ",5404,5440
93,He hasn't been a success; ,5440,5466
94," I could wish the mother would alter him."" ",5465,5508
95,"""That can't be done, your grace,"" said the mother Duck. ",5508,5564
96,"""He's not handsome, but he has a really good disposition, and swims as nicely as any of the rest, even better, I venture to say. ",5564,5693
97,"I believe he will grow handsome, or perhaps in time he will grow even somewhat smaller; ",5693,5781
98," he has lain too long in the egg, and so has not acquired a proper shape."" ",5780,5855
99,And she picked at his neck and smoothed him down. ,5855,5905
100,"""Besides, he's a drake,"" she went on, ""so it doesn't matter quite so much. ",5905,5980
101,"He has, I believe, a good constitution and will win through in the end."" ",5980,6053
102,"""The other ducklings are charming,"" said the old lady. ",6053,6108
103,"""Well, make yourselves at home, and if you happen to find an eel's head, you can bring it to me."" ",6108,6206
104,"So they made themselves at home: but the poor Duckling who had come last out of the egg and looked so ugly, was bitten and buffeted and made to look a fool by the hens and the ducks alike. ",6206,6395
105,"""He's too big,"" they all said; ",6395,6426
106," and the turkey cock, who was born with spurs, and considered himself an emperor on the strength of it, blew himself up like a ship under full sail and went straight at the Duckling, gobbling and getting quite red in the head. ",6425,6652
107,"The poor Duckling didn't know where to stay or which way to go, he was so miserable at being ugly and the butt of the whole duck-yard. ",6652,6787
108,"That was the first day, and as time went on it got worse and worse. ",6787,6855
109,"The wretched Duckling was chased about by everybody, and even his mother and sisters were nasty to him, and kept saying: ""I wish the cat would get you, you ugly devil."" ",6855,7024
110,"And his mother said: ""I wish you'd get right away"";",7024,7075
111," and the ducks bit him and the hens pecked him, and the maid who had to feed the creatures kicked at him. ",7075,7181
112,"So he ran away, and flew over the fence. ",7181,7222
113,The little birds in the bushes shot up in the air in a fright. ,7222,7285
114,"""That's because I'm so ugly,"" the Duckling thought, and shut his eyes, but ran on all the same, till he got out into the wide marsh where the wild-duck lived; ",7285,7444
115," and there he lay all night, for he was very tired and very unhappy. ",7443,7512
116,In the morning the wild-duck flew up and caught sight of their new comrade. ,7512,7588
117,"""What sort of a chap are you?"" ",7588,7619
118,they asked; ,7619,7631
119, and the Duckling turned to this side and that and greeted them as well as he could. ,7630,7715
120,"""You're precious ugly,"" said the wild-ducks; ",7715,7760
121," ""but that doesn't matter to us as long as you don't marry into our family."" ",7759,7836
122,Poor wretch! ,7836,7849
123,"He wasn't thinking much about marrying, as long as he could be allowed to lie among the reeds, and drink a little marsh water. ",7849,7976
124,"There he lay two whole days, and then came a pair of wild geese (or rather wild ganders, for they were both he's): they hadn't been hatched out very long, and so they were particularly lively. ",7976,8169
125,"""Here, mate,"" they said, ""you're so ugly I quite like you. ",8169,8228
126,Will you come along and be a migrant? ,8228,8266
127,Close by in another marsh there's some sweet pretty wild geese--all young ladies that can say Quack. ,8266,8367
128,"You're so ugly you could make your fortune with them."" ",8367,8422
129,At that moment there was a Bang! ,8422,8455
130,Bang! ,8449,8455
131,"and both the wild geese fell dead among the reeds, and the water was stained blood red. ",8461,8549
132,Another bang! ,8549,8563
133,bang! ,8557,8563
134,"and whole flights of geese flew up from the reeds, and there was yet another bang! ",8569,8652
135,a great shoot was afoot. ,8652,8677
136,"The sportsmen were all round the marsh, some even sitting up among the branches of trees that stretched out over the reeds. ",8677,8801
137,"The blue smoke drifted like clouds, in among the dark stems, and hung far out over the water. ",8801,8895
138,The dogs went splash! ,8895,8917
139,splash! ,8909,8917
140,"into the mud, and the reeds and rushes swayed hither and thither; ",8925,8991
141," it was terrible for the wretched Duckling, who was bending his neck to get it under his wing, when all at once, close to him, there was a fearful big dog with his tongue hanging right out of his mouth and his eyes shining horribly. ",8990,9223
142,He thrust his muzzle right at the Duckling and showed his sharp teeth--and then--splash! ,9223,9312
143,Off he went without seizing him. ,9312,9345
144,"""Oh, thank goodness,"" sighed the Duckling; ",9345,9388
145," ""I'm so ugly, even the dog doesn't like to bite me!"" ",9387,9441
146,But there he lay perfectly still while the duck shots rattled in the reeds and gun after gun banged out. ,9441,9546
147,"It was well on in the day before all was quiet, but the unhappy bird dared not get up even then. ",9546,9643
148,"He waited several hours yet, before he looked about him, and then he hurried away from the marsh as fast as ever he could, running over fields and meadows, and such a wind got up that he had hard work to get along. ",9643,9858
149,"Towards evening he was near a poor little cottage, so crazy was it that it didn't know which way to tumble down, so it remained standing. ",9858,9996
150,"The wind howled so fiercely round the Duckling that he had to sit down on his tail to keep facing it, and it grew worse and worse. ",9996,10127
151,"Then he noticed that one hinge of the door was gone, and it hung so crooked that he could slip indoors through the crack, and so he did. ",10127,10264
152,Here lived an old woman with a cat and a hen. ,10264,10310
153,"The cat, whom she called Sonny, could set up his fur and purr, and also throw out sparks, but for this he had to be stroked backwards. ",10310,10445
154,"The Hen had very short little legs, and was consequently called ""chicky short legs"". ",10445,10530
155,"She laid good eggs, and the woman was as fond of her as of a child of her own. ",10530,10609
156,"Next morning the strange Duckling was noticed at once, and the cat began to purr, and the Hen to cluck. ",10609,10713
157,"""What's the matter?"" ",10713,10734
158,"said the old woman, looking all about her. ",10734,10777
159,"But her sight wasn't good, so she took the Duckling for a fat duck that had strayed away. ",10777,10867
160,"""That's a splendid catch,"" she said: ""now I can have duck eggs, if only it isn't a drake! ",10867,10957
161,"We must make sure of that."" ",10957,10985
162,"So the Duckling was taken in on approval for three weeks, but no eggs came. ",10985,11061
163,"The Cat was the gentleman of the house and the Hen the lady, and they always talked of ""we and the world"";",11061,11167
164," for they considered that they were half the world, and much the best half. ",11167,11243
165,"It seemed to the Duckling that some people might think differently, but this the Hen could not tolerate. ",11243,11348
166,"""Can you lay eggs?"" ",11348,11368
167,she asked. ,11368,11379
168,"""No! ",11379,11384
169,"Then will you kindly hold your tongue."" ",11384,11424
170,"And the Cat said: ""Can you put up your fur, or purr, or give out sparks? ",11424,11497
171,No! ,11380,11384
172,"Then you've no call to have an opinion when sensible people are talking."" ",11501,11575
173,So the Duckling lay in a corner and was in the lowest spirits. ,11575,11638
174,"He began to think of the fresh air and sunshine, and such a strange longing to swim in the water came on him that he could not help telling the Hen. ",11638,11787
175,"""What's the matter with you?"" ",11787,11817
176,she asked. ,11368,11379
177,"""You've nothing to do, that's why you get these fancies; ",11828,11885
178," you just lay some eggs, or purr, and they'll pass off."" ",11884,11941
179,"""But it is so delicious to float on the water,"" said the Duckling; ",11941,12008
180," ""so lovely to get it over your head and dive right down to the bottom."" ",12007,12080
181,"""Oh yes, most delightful, of course!"" ",12080,12118
182,said the Hen. ,12118,12132
183,"""Why, you're absolutely mad! ",12132,12161
184,Ask the Cat--he's the cleverest man I know--whether he enjoys floating on the water or diving down; ,12161,12261
185, I say nothing of myself. ,12260,12286
186,"Why, ask your mistress, the old woman; ",12286,12325
187," there's no one in the world cleverer than her--do you suppose she wants to go swimming and getting the water over her head?"" ",12324,12450
188,"""You don't understand me,"" said the Duckling. ",12450,12496
189,"""Well, if we don't understand you, who is going to understand you, pray? ",12496,12569
190,"You'll never be cleverer than the Cat and the woman, to say nothing of me. ",12569,12644
191,"Don't give yourself airs, child, but thank your Maker for all the kindness people have done you. ",12644,12741
192,Don't you live in a warm room among company you can learn something from? ,12741,12815
193,But there! ,12815,12826
194,"You're a rubbishy thing, and there's little entertainment in your company. ",12826,12901
195,You may take it from me! ,12901,12926
196,"I mean well by you, and I'm telling you home truths, and that's how people can see their true friends. ",12926,13029
197,"Now just do take pains to lay eggs, or learn to purr or else give sparks."" ",13029,13104
198,"""I think I'll go out into the wide world,"" said the Duckling. ",13104,13166
199,"""Very well, do,"" said the Hen. ",13166,13197
200,So the Duckling went off and swam on the water and dived into it; ,13197,13263
201, but he was looked down upon by all the creatures because of his ugliness. ,13262,13337
202,"Autumn now came on: the leaves of the wood turned brown and yellow, the wind caught them and made them dance about, and above the sky looked cold, where the clouds hung heavy with hail and snow, and on the fence the raven perched and cried ""Caw! ",13337,13583
203,"Caw!"" ",13583,13589
204,for the mere cold. ,13589,13608
205,"Indeed, it regularly gave you the shivers to think of it. ",13608,13666
206,The unhappy Duckling had a very hard time. ,13666,13709
207,"One evening, when there was a lovely sunset, a whole flock of beautiful great birds rose out of the bushes. ",13709,13817
208,The Duckling had never seen any so handsome. ,13817,13862
209,"They were brilliantly white, with long supple necks. ",13862,13915
210,"They were swans, and they uttered a strange sound and spread their splendid long wings and flew far away from the cold region to warmer lands, and unfrozen lakes. ",13915,14078
211,"They mounted so high, so high that the ugly little Duckling was strangely moved; ",14078,14159
212," he whirled himself round in the water like a wheel, he stretched his neck straight up into the air after them and uttered such a loud cry, so strange, that he was quite frightened at it himself. ",14158,14354
213,"Oh, he could not forget those beautiful birds, those wonderful birds! ",14354,14424
214,"And the moment they were out of sight he dived right down to the bottom of the water, and when he came up again he was almost beside himself. ",14424,14566
215,"He didn't know what the birds were called or which way they were flying, but he loved them as he had never loved anything yet. ",14566,14693
216,He was not envious of them--how could it enter his mind to wish for such beauty for himself--he would have been happy if even the ducks had let him into their company--poor ugly creature. ,14693,14881
217,"The winter grew very very cold: the Duckling was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing quite over, but every night the hole he swam in became smaller and smaller. ",14881,15066
218,It froze so hard that the ice cracked again; ,15066,15111
219," the Duckling had always to be moving about to keep the water open, till at last he was tired out and sat still, and was frozen fast in the ice. ",15110,15255
220,"Early in the morning a labourer came that way, saw him, went on the ice and with his wooden shoe broke it up and carried the Duckling home to his wife, and there he was brought to life again. ",15255,15447
221,"The children wanted to play with him, but he thought they meant to hurt him, and in his fright he dashed right into the milk-pan and made the milk splash out into the room. ",15447,15620
222,The woman screamed and threw up her hands. ,15620,15663
223,Then he flew into the butter-tub and after that into the meal-bin and out again. ,15663,15744
224,"Goodness, what a sight he was! ",15744,15775
225,"The woman screamed out and hit at him with the tongs, and the children tumbled over one another trying to catch him, laughing, calling out--by good luck the door stood open, and out he rushed into the bushes, on the new fallen snow, and there he lay almost in a swoon. ",15775,16044
226,But it would be too sad to tell of all the hardships and miseries which he had to go through in that hard winter. ,16044,16158
227,"When the sun began once more to shine out warm and the larks to sing, he was lying among the reeds in the marsh, and it was the beautiful spring. ",16158,16304
228,"Then all at once he lifted his wings, and they rustled more strongly than before, and bore him swiftly away; ",16304,16413
229," and before he knew it he was in a spacious garden where were apple trees in blossom, and sweet-smelling lilacs hung on long green boughs right down to the winding moat. ",16412,16582
230,"Oh, it was lovely here, and fresh with spring; ",16582,16629
231," and straight in front of him, out of the shadows, came three beautiful white swans with rustling plumage floating lightly on the water. ",16628,16765
232,"The Duckling recognized the splendid creatures, and a strange sorrowfulness came over him. ",16765,16856
233,"""I will fly to them, these royal birds, and they will peck me to death because I, who am so ugly, dare to approach them; ",16856,16977
234, but it doesn't matter; ,16976,17000
235," it's better to be killed by them than to be snapped at by the ducks and pecked at by hens and kicked by the servant who looks after the poultry-yard, and suffer all the winter."" ",16999,17178
236,"So he flew out into the open water and swam towards the stately swans, and they saw him and hastened with swelling plumage to meet him. ",17178,17314
237,"""Yes, kill me,"" the poor creature said, bowing his head down to the water, and waited for death. ",17314,17411
238,But what did he see in the clear water? ,17411,17451
239,"He beheld his own image, but it was no longer that of a clumsy dark grey bird, ugly and repulsive. ",17451,17550
240,He was a swan himself. ,17550,17573
241,"It doesn't matter in the least whether you are born in the duck-yard, if only you've lain in a swan's egg. ",17573,17680
242,"It really delighted him now to think of all the hardships and adversities he had suffered, now he could rightly discern his good fortune and all the beauty that greeted him. ",17680,17854
243,The great swans swam round him and caressed him with their bills. ,17854,17920
244,"Some little children now came into the garden and threw bread and corn into the water, and the smallest of them cried: ""There's a new one!"" ",17920,18060
245,"And the others called out in delight: ""Yes, there's a new one come!"" ",18060,18129
246,They clapped their hands and danced about and ran to their father and mother. ,18129,18207
247,"More bread and cake was thrown into the water, and everyone said: ""The new one is the handsomest of all; ",18207,18312
248," how young and beautiful he is!"" ",18311,18344
249,And the elder swans bowed before him. ,18344,18382
250,"At that he felt quite ill at ease, and covered his head with his wings, and knew not what to do. ",18382,18479
251,"He was more than happy, and yet not proud, for a good heart is never puffed up. ",18479,18559
252,"He thought how persecuted and depressed he had been, yet now he heard everyone saying he was the most beautiful of all beautiful birds. ",18559,18695
253,"And the lilacs bowed their branches down to the water, and the sun shone warm and pleasant, and his plumage ruffled, and he raised his slender neck, and from his heart he said joyfully: ""Such happiness I never dreamed of when I was the Ugly Duckling.""",18695,18947
