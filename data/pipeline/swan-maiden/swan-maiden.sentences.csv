0,Once there was a king who had a pear-tree which bore four-and-twenty golden pears. ,0,83
1,Every day he went into the garden and counted them to see that none were missing. ,83,165
2,"But, one morning, he found that a pear had been taken during the night, and thereat he was troubled and vexed to the heart, for the pear-tree was as dear to him as the apple of his eye. ",165,351
3,"Now, the king had three sons, and so he called the eldest prince to him. ",351,424
4,"""See,"" said he, ""if you will watch my pear-tree to-night, and will find me the thief who stole the pear, you shall have half of my kingdom now, and the whole of it when I am gone."" ",424,605
5,"You can guess how the prince was tickled at this: oh, yes, he would watch the tree, and if the thief should come he should not get away again as easily. ",605,758
6,"Well, that night he sat down beside the tree, with his gun across his knees, to wait for the coming of the thief. ",758,872
7,"He waited and waited, and still he saw not so much as a thread or a hair. ",872,946
8,"But about the middle of the night there came the very prettiest music that his ears had ever heard, and before he knew what he was about he was asleep and snoring until the little leaves shook upon the tree. ",946,1154
9,"When the morning came and he awoke, another pear was gone, and he could tell no more about it than the man in the moon. ",1154,1274
10,The next night the second son set out to watch the pear-tree. ,1274,1336
11,But he fared no better than the first. ,1336,1375
12,"About midnight came the music, and in a little while he was snoring till the stones rattled. ",1375,1468
13,"When the morning came another pear was gone, and he had no more to tell about it than his brother. ",1468,1567
14,"The third night it was the turn of the youngest son, and he was more clever than the others, for, when the evening came, he stuffed his ears full of wax, so that he was as deaf as a post. ",1567,1755
15,"About midnight, when the music came, he heard nothing of it, and so he stayed wide awake. ",1755,1845
16,"After the music had ended he took the wax out of his ears, so that he might listen for the coming of the thief. ",1845,1957
17,"Presently there was a loud clapping and rattling, and a white swan flew overhead and lit in the pear-tree above him. ",1957,2074
18,"It began picking at one of the pears, and then the prince raised his gun to shoot at it. ",2074,2163
19,"But when he looked along the barrel it was not a swan that he saw up in the pear-tree, but the prettiest girl that he had ever looked upon. ",2163,2303
20,"""Don't shoot me, king's son! ",2303,2332
21,"Don't shoot me!"" ",2332,2349
22,cried she. ,2349,2360
23,"But the prince had no thought of shooting her, for he had never seen such a beautiful maiden in all of his days. ",2360,2473
24,"""Very well,"" said he, ""I will not shoot, but, if I spare your life, will you promise to be my sweetheart and to marry me?"" ",2473,2596
25,"""That may be as may be,"" said the Swan Maiden. ",2596,2643
26,"""For listen! ",2643,2656
27,I serve the witch with three eyes. ,2656,2691
28,"She lives on the glass hill that lies beyond the seven high mountains, the seven deep valleys, and the seven wide rivers; ",2691,2813
29," are you man enough to go that far?"" ",2812,2849
30,"""Oh, yes,"" said the prince, ""I am man enough for that and more too."" ",2849,2918
31,"""That is good,"" said the Swan Maiden, and thereupon she jumped down from the pear-tree to the earth. ",2918,3019
32,"Then she became a swan again, and bade the king's son to mount upon her back at the roots of her wings. ",3019,3123
33,"When he had done as she had told him, she sprang into the air and flew away, bearing him with her. ",3123,3222
34,"On flew the swan, and on and on, until, by and by, she said, ""What do you see, king's son?"" ",3222,3314
35,"""I see the grey sky above me and the dark earth below me, but nothing else,"" said he. ",3314,3400
36,"After that they flew on and on again, until, at last, the Swan Maiden said, ""What do you see now, king's son?"" ",3400,3511
37,"""I see the grey sky above me and the dark earth below me, but nothing else,"" said he. ",3314,3400
38,"So once more they flew on until the Swan Maiden said, for the third time, ""And what do you see by now, king's son?"" ",3597,3713
39,"But this time the prince said, ""I see the grey sky above me and the dark earth below me, and over yonder is a glass hill, and on the hill is a house that shines like fire."" ",3713,3886
40,"""That is where the witch with three eyes lives,"" said the Swan Maiden; ",3886,3957
41," ""and now listen: when she asks you what it is that you came for, ask her to give you the one who draws the water and builds the fire; ",3956,4091
42," for that is myself."" ",4090,4112
43,"So, when they had come to the top of the hill of glass, the king's son stepped down to the ground, and the swan flew over the roof. ",4112,4244
44,Rap! ,4244,4249
45,tap! ,4249,4254
46,tap! ,4249,4254
47,"he knocked at the door, and the old witch herself came and opened it. ",4259,4329
48,"""And what do you want here?"" ",4329,4358
49,said she. ,4358,4368
50,"""I want the one who draws the water and builds the fire,"" said the prince. ",4368,4443
51,At this the old witch scowled until her eyebrows met. ,4443,4497
52,"""Very well,"" said she, ""you shall have what you want if you can clean my stables to-morrow between the rise and the set of the sun. ",4497,4629
53,"But I tell you plainly, if you fail in the doing, you shall be torn to pieces body and bones."" ",4629,4724
54,But the prince was not to be scared away with empty words. ,4724,4783
55,So the next morning the old witch came and took him to the stables where he was to do his task. ,4783,4879
56,"There stood more than a hundred cattle, and the stable had not been cleaned for at least ten long years. ",4879,4984
57,"""There is your work,"" said the old witch, and then she left him. ",4984,5049
58,"Well, the king's son set to work with fork and broom and might and main, but-prut!-he might as well have tried to bale out the great ocean with a bucket. ",5049,5203
59,At noontide who should come to the stable but the pretty Swan Maiden herself. ,5203,5281
60,"""When one is tired, one should rest for a while,"" said she; ",5281,5341
61," ""come and lay your head in my lap."" ",5340,5377
62,"The prince was glad enough to do as she said, for nothing was to be gained by working at that task. ",5377,5477
63,"So he laid his head in her lap, and she combed his hair with a golden comb till he fell fast asleep. ",5477,5578
64,"When he awoke the Swan Maiden was gone, the sun was setting, and the stable was as clean as a plate. ",5578,5679
65,"Presently he heard the old witch coming, so up he jumped and began clearing away a straw here and a speck there, just as though he were finishing the work. ",5679,5835
66,"""You never did this by yourself!"" ",5835,5869
67,"said the old witch, and her brows grew as black as a thunder-storm. ",5869,5937
68,"""That may be so, and that may not be so,"" said the king's son, ""but you lent no hand to help; ",5937,6031
69," so now may I have the one who builds the fire and draws the water?"" ",6030,6099
70,At this the old witch shook her head. ,6099,6137
71,"""No,"" said she, ""there is more to be done yet before you can have what you ask for. ",6137,6221
72,"If you can thatch the roof of the stable with bird feathers, no two of which shall be of the same color, and can do it between the rise and the set of sun to-morrow, then you shall have your sweetheart and welcome. ",6221,6436
73,"But if you fail your bones shall be ground as fine as malt in the mill."" ",6436,6509
74,Very well; ,6509,6520
75, that suited the king's son well enough. ,6519,6560
76,So at sunrise he arose and went into the fields with his gun; ,6560,6622
77," but if there were birds to be shot, it was few of them that he saw; ",6621,6690
78," for at noontide he had but two, and they were both of a color. ",6689,6753
79,At that time who should come to him but the Swan Maiden. ,6753,6810
80,"""One should not tramp and tramp all day with never a bit of rest,"" said she; ",6810,6887
81," ""come hither and lay your head in my lap for a while."" ",6886,6942
82,"The prince did as she bade him, and the maiden again combed his hair with a golden comb until he fell asleep. ",6942,7052
83,"When he awoke the sun was setting, and his work was done. ",7052,7110
84,"He heard the old witch coming, so up he jumped to the roof of the stable and began laying a feather here and a feather there, for all the world as though he were just finishing his task. ",7110,7297
85,"""You never did that work alone,"" said the old witch. ",7297,7350
86,"""That may be so, and that may not be so,"" said the prince; ",7350,7409
87," ""all the same, it was none of your doing. ",7408,7451
88,"So now may I have the one who draws the water and builds the fire?"" ",7451,7519
89,But the witch shook her head. ,7519,7549
90,"""No,"" said she, ""there is still another task to do before that. ",7549,7613
91,Over yonder is a fir-tree; ,7613,7640
92," on the tree is a crow's nest, and in the nest are three eggs. ",7639,7702
93,"If you can harry that nest to-morrow between the rising and the setting of the sun, neither breaking nor leaving a single egg, you shall have that for which you ask."" ",7702,7869
94,Very well; ,6509,6520
95, that suited the prince. ,7879,7904
96,"The next morning at the rising of the sun he started off to find the fir-tree, and there was no trouble in the finding I can tell you, for it was more than a hundred feet high, and as smooth as glass from root to tip. ",7904,8122
97,"As for climbing it, he might as well have tried to climb a moonbeam, for in spite of all his trying he did nothing but slip and slip. ",8122,8256
98,By and by came the Swan Maiden as she had come before. ,8256,8311
99,"""Do you climb the fir-tree?"" ",8311,8340
100,said she. ,4358,4368
101,"""None too well,"" said the king's son. ",8350,8388
102,"""Then I may help you in a hard task,"" said she. ",8388,8436
103,"She let down the braids of her golden hair, so that it hung down all about her and upon the ground, and then she began singing to the wind. ",8436,8576
104,"She sang and sang, and by and by the wind began to blow, and, catching up the maiden's hair, carried it to the top of the fir-tree, and there tied it to the branches. ",8576,8743
105,Then the prince climbed the hair and so reached the nest. ,8743,8801
106,There were the three eggs; ,8801,8828
107," he gathered them, and then he came down as he had gone up. ",8827,8887
108,"After that the wind came again and loosed the maiden's hair from the branches, and she bound it up as it was before. ",8887,9004
109,"""Now, listen,"" said she to the prince: ""when the old witch asks you for the three crow's eggs which you have gathered, tell her that they belong to the one who found them. ",9004,9176
110,"She will not be able to take them from you, and they are worth something, I can tell you."" ",9176,9267
111,"At sunset the old witch came hobbling along, and there sat the prince at the foot of the fir-tree. ",9267,9366
112,"""Have you gathered the crow's eggs?"" ",9366,9403
113,said she. ,4358,4368
114,"""Yes,"" said the prince, ""here they are in my handkerchief. ",9413,9472
115,"And now may I have the one who draws the water and builds the fire?"" ",9472,9541
116,"""Yes,"" said the old witch, ""you may have her; ",9541,9587
117," only give me my crow's eggs."" ",9586,9617
118,"""No,"" said the prince, ""the crow's eggs are none of yours, for they belong to him who gathered them."" ",9617,9719
119,"When the old witch found that she was not to get her crow's eggs in that way, she tried another, and began using words as sweet as honey. ",9719,9857
120,"Come, come, there should be no hard feeling between them. ",9857,9915
121,"The prince had served her faithfully, and before he went home with what he had come for he should have a good supper, for it is ill to travel on an empty stomach. ",9915,10078
122,"So she brought the prince into the house, and then she left him while she went to put the pot on the fire, and to sharpen the bread-knife on the stone door-step. ",10078,10240
123,"While the prince sat waiting for the witch, there came a tap at the door, and whom should it be but the pretty Swan Maiden. ",10240,10364
124,"""Come,"" said she, ""and bring the three eggs with you, for the knife that the old witch is sharpening is for you, and so is the great pot on the fire, for she means to pick your bones in the morning."" ",10364,10564
125,She led the prince down into the kitchen; ,10564,10606
126," there they made a figure out of honey and barley-meal, so that it was all soft and sticky; ",10605,10697
127, then the maiden dressed the figure in her own clothes and set it in the chimney-corner by the fire. ,10696,10797
128,"After that was done, she became a swan again, and, taking the prince upon her back, she flew away, over hill and over dale. ",10797,10921
129,"As for the old witch, she sat on the stone door-step, sharpening her knife. ",10921,10997
130,"By and by she came in, and, look as she might, there was no prince to be found. ",10997,11077
131,Then if anybody was ever in a rage it was the old witch; ,11077,11134
132," off she went, storming and fuming, until she came to the kitchen. ",11133,11200
133,"There sat the woman of honey and barley-meal beside the fire, dressed in the maiden's clothes, and the old woman thought that it was the girl herself. ",11200,11351
134,"""Where is your sweetheart?"" ",11351,11379
135,said she; ,5331,5341
136, but to this the woman of honey and barley-meal answered never a word. ,11388,11459
137,"""How now! ",11459,11469
138,"are you dumb?"" ",11469,11484
139,cried the old witch; ,11484,11505
140," ""I will see whether I cannot bring speech to your lips."" ",11504,11562
141,"She raised her hand-slap!-she struck, and so hard was the blow that her hand stuck fast to the honey and barley-meal. ",11562,11680
142,"""What!"" ",11680,11688
143,"cried she, ""will you hold me?""",11688,11718
144,"""-slap!-she struck with the other hand, and it too stuck fast. ",11717,11780
145,"So there she was, and, for all that I know, she is sticking to the woman of honey and barley-meal to this day. ",11780,11891
146,"As for the Swan Maiden and the prince, they flew over the seven high mountains, the seven deep valleys, and the seven wide rivers, until they came near to the prince's home again. ",11891,12071
147,"The Swan Maiden lit in a great wide field, and there she told the prince to break open one of the crow's eggs. ",12071,12182
148,"The prince did as she bade him, and what should he find but the most beautiful little palace, all of pure gold and silver. ",12182,12305
149,"He set the palace on the ground, and it grew and grew and grew until it covered as much ground as seven large barns. ",12305,12422
150,"Then the Swan Maiden told him to break another egg, and he did as she said, and what should come out of it but such great herds of cows and sheep that they covered the meadow far and near. ",12422,12611
151,"The Swan Maiden told him to break the third egg, and out of it came scores and scores of servants all dressed in gold and silver livery. ",12611,12748
152,"That morning, when the king looked out of his bedroom window, there stood the splendid castle of silver and gold. ",12748,12862
153,"Then he called all of his people together, and they rode over to see what it meant. ",12862,12946
154,On the way they met such herds of fat sheep and cattle that the king had never seen the like in all of his life before; ,12946,13066
155," and when he came to the fine castle, there were two rows of servants dressed in clothes of silver and gold, ready to meet him. ",13065,13193
156,"But when he came to the door of the castle, there stood the prince himself. ",13193,13269
157,"Then there was joy and rejoicing, you may be sure! ",13269,13320
158,"only the two elder brothers looked down in the mouth, for since the young prince had found the thief who stole the golden pears, their father's kingdom was not for them. ",13320,13490
159,"But the prince soon set their minds at rest on that score, for he had enough and more than enough of his own. ",13490,13600
160,"After that the prince and the Swan Maiden were married, and a grand wedding they had of it, with music of fiddles and kettle-drums, and plenty to eat and to drink. ",13600,13764
161,"I, too, was there; ",13764,13783
162," but all of the good red wine ran down over my tucker, so that not a drop of it passed my lips, and I had to come away empty. ",13782,13908
163,And that is all.,13908,13925
