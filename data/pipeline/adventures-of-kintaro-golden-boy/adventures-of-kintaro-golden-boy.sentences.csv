0,"Long, long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki. ",0,67
1,Now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her. ,67,126
2,"Not long after this, through the malice of some of his friends, he fell into disgrace at Court and was dismissed. ",126,240
3,This misfortune so preyed upon his mind that he did not long survive his dismissal. ,240,324
4,"He died, leaving behind him his beautiful young wife to face the world alone. ",324,402
5,"Fearing her husband's enemies, she fled to the Ashigara Mountains as soon as her husband was dead. ",402,501
6,"There in the lonely forests where no one ever came except woodcutters, a little boy was born to her. ",501,602
7,She called him Kintaro or the Golden Boy. ,602,644
8,"Now the remarkable thing about this child was his great strength, and as he grew older he grew stronger and stronger. ",644,762
9,By the time he was eight years of age he was able to cut down trees as quickly as the woodcutters. ,762,861
10,"Then his mother gave him a large ax, and he used to go out in the forest and help the woodcutters, who called him ""Wonder-child,"" and his mother the ""Old Nurse of the Mountains,"" for they did not know her high rank. ",861,1077
11,Another favorite pastime of Kintaro's was to smash up rocks and stones. ,1077,1149
12,You can imagine how strong he was! ,1149,1184
13,"Quite unlike other boys, Kintaro, grew up all alone in the mountain wilds. ",1184,1259
14,As he had no companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak their strange talk. ,1259,1384
15,"By degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon Kintaro as their master, and he used them as his servants and messengers. ",1384,1510
16,"But his special retainers were the bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare. ",1510,1586
17,The bear often brought her cubs for Kintaro to romp with. ,1586,1644
18,When she came to take them home Kintaro would get on her back and have a ride to her cave. ,1644,1735
19,"He was very fond of the deer too, and would often put his arms round the creature's neck to show that its long horns did not frighten him. ",1735,1874
20,Great was the fun they all had together. ,1874,1915
21,"One day, as usual, Kintaro went up into the mountains, followed by the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare. ",1915,2028
22,"After walking for some time up hill and down dale and over rough roads, they suddenly came out upon a wide and grassy plain covered with pretty wild flowers. ",2028,2186
23,"Here, indeed, was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together. ",2186,2265
24,"The deer rubbed his horns against a tree for pleasure, the monkey scratched his back, the hare smoothed his long ears, and the bear gave a grunt of satisfaction. ",2265,2427
25,"Kintaro said, ""Here is a place for a good game. ",2427,2475
26,"What do you all say to a wrestling match?"" ",2475,2518
27,"The bear being the biggest and the oldest, answered for the others: ""That will be great fun,"" said she. ",2518,2622
28,"""I am the strongest animal, so I will make the platform for the wrestlers."" ",2622,2698
29,She set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape. ,2698,2772
30,"""All right,"" said Kintaro, ""I will look on while you all wrestle with each other. ",2772,2854
31,"I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round."" ",2854,2911
32,"""What fun! ",2911,2922
33,"we shall all try to get the prize,"" said the bear. ",2922,2973
34,"The deer, the monkey and the hare set to work to help the bear raise the platform on which they were all to wrestle. ",2973,3090
35,"When this was finished, Kintaro cried out: ""Now begin! ",3090,3145
36,the monkey and the hare shall open the sports and the deer shall be umpire. ,3145,3221
37,"Now, Mr. ",3221,3230
38,"Deer, you are to be umpire!"" ",3230,3259
39,"""He, he!"" ",3259,3269
40,answered the deer. ,3269,3288
41,"""I will be umpire. ",3288,3307
42,"Now, Mr. Monkey and Mr. Hare, if you are both ready, please walk out and take your places on the platform."" ",3307,3415
43,"Then the monkey and the hare both hopped out, quickly and nimbly, to the wrestling platform. ",3415,3508
44,"The deer, as umpire, stood between the two and called out: ""Red-back! ",3508,3578
45,"Red-back!"" ",3578,3589
46,"(this to the monkey, who has a red back in Japan). ",3589,3640
47,"""Are you ready?"" ",3640,3657
48,"Then he turned to the hare: ""Long-ears! ",3657,3697
49,Long-ears! ,3686,3697
50,"are you ready?"" ",3708,3724
51,Both the little wrestlers faced each other while the deer raised a leaf on high as signal. ,3724,3815
52,"When he dropped the leaf the monkey and the hare rushed upon each other, crying ""Yoisho, yoisho!"" ",3815,3913
53,"While the monkey and the hare wrestled, the deer called out encouragingly or shouted warnings to each of them as the hare or the monkey pushed each other near the edge of the platform and were in danger of falling over. ",3913,4133
54,"""Red-back! ",3567,3578
55,Red-back! ,3568,3578
56,"stand your ground!"" ",4154,4174
57,called out the deer. ,4174,4195
58,"""Long-ears! ",3685,3697
59,Long-ears! ,3686,3697
60,"be strong, be strong-don't let the monkey beat you!"" ",4218,4271
61,grunted the bear. ,4271,4289
62,"So the monkey and the hare, encouraged by their friends, tried their very hardest to beat each other. ",4289,4391
63,The hare at last gained on the monkey. ,4391,4430
64,"The monkey seemed to trip up, and the hare giving him a good push sent him flying off the platform with a bound. ",4430,4543
65,"The poor monkey sat up rubbing his back, and his face was very long as he screamed angrily. ",4543,4635
66,"""Oh, oh! ",4635,4644
67,"how my back hurts-my back hurts me!"" ",4644,4681
68,"Seeing the monkey in this plight on the ground, the deer holding his leaf on high said: ""This round is finished-the hare has won."" ",4681,4812
69,"Kintaro then opened his luncheon box and taking out a rice-dumpling, gave it to the hare saying: ""Here is your prize, and you have earned, it well!"" ",4812,4961
70,"Now the monkey got up looking very cross, and as they say in Japan ""his stomach stood up,"" for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten. ",4961,5100
71,"So he said to Kintaro and the others who were standing by: ""I have not been fairly beaten. ",5100,5191
72,My foot slipped and I tumbled. ,5191,5222
73,"Please give me another chance and let the hare wrestle with me for another round."" ",5222,5305
74,"Then Kintaro consenting, the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again. ",5305,5378
75,"Now, as every one knows, the monkey is a cunning animal by nature, and he made up his mind to get the best of the hare this time if it were possible. ",5378,5528
76,"To do this, he thought that the best and surest way would be to get hold of the hare's long ear. ",5528,5625
77,This he soon managed to do. ,5625,5653
78,The hare was quite thrown off his guard by the pain of having his long ear pulled so hard. ,5653,5744
79,"The monkey seizing his opportunity at last, caught hold of one of the hare's legs and sent him sprawling in the middle of the dais. ",5744,5876
80,"The monkey was now the victor and received, a rice-dumpling from Kintaro, which pleased him so much that he quite forgot his sore back. ",5876,6012
81,"The deer with long horns and the hare with long ears, it must have been an amusing sight to those who watched this queer match. ",6012,6140
82,"Suddenly the deer went down on one of his knees, and the bear with the leaf on high declared him beaten. ",6140,6245
83,"In this way, sometimes the one, sometimes the other, conquering, the little party amused themselves till they were tired. ",6245,6367
84,"At last Kintaro got up and said: ""This is enough for to-day. ",6367,6428
85,What a nice place we have found for wrestling! ,6428,6475
86,Let us come again to-morrow. ,6475,6504
87,"Now, we will all go home. ",6504,6530
88,"Come along!"" ",6530,6543
89,"So saying, Kintaro led the way while the animals followed. ",6543,6602
90,After walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a valley. ,6602,6701
91,Kintaro and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing. ,6701,6787
92,Bridge there was none. ,6787,6810
93,"The river rushed ""don, don"" on its way. ",6810,6850
94,"All the animals looked serious, wondering how they could cross the stream and get home that evening. ",6850,6951
95,"Kintaro, however, said: ""Wait a moment. ",6951,6991
96,"I will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes."" ",6991,7048
97,"The bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now. ",7048,7135
98,Kintaro went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank. ,7135,7205
99,At last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the water's edge. ,7205,7292
100,"He took hold of the trunk and pulled it with all his might, once, twice, thrice! ",7292,7373
101,"At the third pull, so great was Kintaro's strength that the roots gave way, and ""meri, meri"" (crash, crash), over fell the tree, forming an excellent bridge across the stream. ",7373,7549
102,"""There,"" said Kintaro, ""what do you think of my bridge? ",7549,7605
103,"It is quite safe, so follow me,"" and he stepped across first. ",7605,7667
104,The four animals followed. ,7667,7694
105,"Never had they seen any one so strong before, and they all exclaimed: ""How strong he is! ",7694,7783
106,"how strong he is!"" ",7783,7802
107,"While all this was going on by the river a woodcutter, who happened to be standing on a rock overlooking the stream, had seen all that passed beneath him. ",7802,7957
108,He watched with great surprise Kintaro and his animal companions. ,7957,8023
109,He rubbed his eyes to be sure that he was not dreaming when he saw this boy pull over a tree by the roots and throw it across the stream to form a bridge. ,8023,8178
110,"The woodcutter, for such he seemed to be by his dress, marveled at all he saw, and said to himself: ""This is no ordinary child. ",8178,8306
111,Whose son can he be? ,8306,8327
112,"I will find out before this day is done."" ",8327,8369
113,He hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them. ,8369,8441
114,"Kintaro knew nothing of all this, and little guessed that he was being followed. ",8441,8522
115,"On reaching the other side of the river he and the animals separated, they to their lairs in the woods and he to his mother, who was waiting for him. ",8522,8672
116,"As soon as he entered the cottage, which stood like a matchbox in the heart of the pine-woods, he went to greet his mother, saying: ""Okkasan (mother), here I am!"" ",8672,8835
117,"""O, Kimbo!"" ",8835,8847
118,"said his mother with a bright smile, glad to see her boy home safe after the long day. ",8847,8934
119,"""How late you are to-day. ",8934,8960
120,I feared that something had happened to you. ,8960,9005
121,"Where have you been all the time?"" ",9005,9040
122,"""I took my four friends, the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare, up into the hills. ",9040,9130
123,"There I made them try a wrestling match, to see which was the strongest. ",9130,9203
124,"We all enjoyed the sport, and are going to the same place to-morrow to have another match."" ",9203,9295
125,"""Now tell me who is the strongest of all?"" ",9295,9338
126,"asked his mother, pretending not to know. ",9338,9380
127,"""Oh, mother,"" said Kintaro, ""don't you know that I am the strongest? ",9380,9449
128,"There was no need for me to wrestle with any of them."" ",9449,9504
129,"""But next to you then, who is the strongest?"" ",9504,9550
130,"""The bear comes next to me in strength,"" answered Kintaro. ",9550,9609
131,"""And after the bear?"" ",9609,9631
132,asked his mother again. ,9631,9655
133,"""Next to the bear it is not easy to say which is the strongest, for the deer, the monkey, and the hare all seem to be as strong as each other,"" said Kintaro. ",9655,9813
134,Suddenly Kintaro and his mother were startled by a voice from outside. ,9813,9884
135,"""Listen to me, little boy! ",9884,9911
136,"Next time you go, take this old man with you to the wrestling match. ",9911,9980
137,"He would like to join the sport too!"" ",9980,10018
138,It was the old woodcutter who had followed Kintaro from the river. ,10018,10085
139,He slipped off his clogs and entered the cottage. ,10085,10135
140,Yama-uba and her son were both taken by surprise. ,10135,10185
141,They looked at the intruder wonderingly and saw that he was some one they had never seen before. ,10185,10282
142,"""Who are you?"" ",10282,10297
143,they both exclaimed. ,10297,10318
144,"Then the woodcutter laughed and said: ""It does not matter who I am yet, but let us see who has the strongest arm-this boy or myself?"" ",10318,10452
145,"Then Kintaro, who had lived all his life in the forest, answered the old man without any ceremony, saying: ""We will have a try if you wish it, but you must not be angry whoever is beaten."" ",10452,10641
146,Then Kintaro and the woodcutter both put out their right arms and grasped each other's hands. ,10641,10735
147,"For a long time Kintaro and the old man wrestled together in this way, each trying to bend the other's arm, but the old man was very strong, and the strange pair were evenly matched. ",10735,10918
148,"At last the old man desisted, declaring it a drawn game. ",10918,10975
149,"""You are, indeed, a very strong child. ",10975,11014
150,"There are few men who can boast of the strength of my right arm!"" ",11014,11080
151,said the woodcutter. ,11080,11101
152,"""I saw you first on the banks of the river a few hours ago, when you pulled up that large tree to make a bridge across the torrent. ",11101,11233
153,Hardly able to believe what I saw I followed you home. ,11233,11288
154,"Your strength of arm, which I have just tried, proves what I saw this afternoon. ",11288,11369
155,When you are full-grown you will surely be the strongest man in all Japan. ,11369,11444
156,"It is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains."" ",11444,11508
157,"Then he turned to Kintaro's mother: ""And you, mother, have you no thought of taking your child to the Capital, and of teaching him to carry a sword as befits a samurai (a Japanese knight)?"" ",11508,11698
158,"""You are very kind to take so much interest in my son."" ",11698,11754
159,replied the mother; ,11754,11774
160," ""but he is as you see, wild and uneducated. ",11773,11818
161,I fear it would be very difficult to do as you say. ,11818,11870
162,"Because of his great strength as an infant I hid him away in this unknown part of the country, for he hurt every one that came near him. ",11870,12007
163,"I have often wished that I could, one day, see my boy a knight wearing two swords. ",12007,12090
164,"But as we have no influential friend to introduce us at the Capital, I fear my hope will never come true."" ",12090,12197
165,"""You need not trouble yourself about that. ",12197,12240
166,To tell you the truth I am no woodcutter! ,12240,12282
167,I am one of the great generals of Japan. ,12282,12323
168,"My name is Sadamitsu, and I am a vassal of the powerful Lord Minamoto-no-Raiko. ",12323,12403
169,"He ordered me to go round the country and look for boys who give promise of remarkable strength, so that they may be trained as soldiers for his army. ",12403,12554
170,I thought that I could best do this by assuming the disguise of a woodcutter. ,12554,12632
171,"By good fortune, I have thus unexpectedly come across your son. ",12632,12696
172,"Now if you really wish him to be a samurai, I will take him and present him to the Lord Raiko as a candidate for his service. ",12696,12822
173,"What do you say to this?"" ",12822,12848
174,As the kind general gradually unfolded his plan the mother's heart was filled with a great joy. ,12848,12944
175,She saw that here was a wonderful chance of the one wish of her life being fulfilled-that of seeing Kintaro a samurai before she died. ,12944,13079
176,"Bowing her head to the ground, she replied: ""I will then entrust my son to you if you really mean what you say."" ",13079,13192
177,Kintaro had all this time been sitting by his mother's side listening to what they said. ,13192,13281
178,"When his mother finished speaking, he exclaimed: ""Oh, joy! ",13281,13340
179,joy! ,13335,13340
180,"I am to go with the general and one day I shall be a samurai!"" ",13345,13408
181,"Thus Kintaro's fate was settled, and the general decided to start for the Capital at once, taking Kintaro with him. ",13408,13524
182,"It need hardly be said that Yama-uba was sad at parting with her boy, for he was all that was left to her. ",13524,13631
183,But she hid her grief with a strong face. ,13631,13673
184,She knew that it was for her boy's good that he should leave her now. ,13673,13743
185,She must not discourage him just as he was setting out. ,13743,13799
186,"Kintaro promised never to forget her, and said that as soon as he was a knight wearing two swords he would build her a home and take care of her in her old age. ",13799,13960
187,"All the animals, those he had tamed to serve him, the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare, as soon as they found out that he was going away, came to ask if they might attend him as usual. ",13960,14153
188,When they learned that he was going away for good they followed him to the foot of the mountain to see him off. ,14153,14265
189,"""Kimbo,"" said his mother, ""mind and be a good boy."" ",14265,14317
190,"""Mr. Kintaro,"" said the faithful animals, ""we wish you good health on your travels."" ",14317,14402
191,Then they all climbed a tree to see the last of him. ,14402,14455
192,"From that height they watched him and his shadow gradually grow smaller and smaller, till he was lost to sight. ",14455,14567
193,The general Sadamitsu went on his way rejoicing at having so unexpectedly found such a prodigy as Kintaro. ,14567,14674
194,"Having arrived at their destination the general took Kintaro at once to his Lord, Minamoto-no-Raiko. ",14674,14775
195,He told him all about Kintaro and how he had found the child. ,14775,14837
196,"Lord Raiko was delighted with the story, and having commanded Kintaro to be brought to him, made him one of his vassals at once. ",14837,14966
197,"Lord Raiko's army was famous for its band called ""The Four Braves."" ",14966,15034
198,These warriors were chosen by himself from amongst the bravest and strongest of his soldiers. ,15034,15128
199,The small and well-picked band was distinguished throughout the whole of Japan for the dauntless courage of its men. ,15128,15245
200,When Kintaro grew up to be a man his master made him the Chief of the Four Braves. ,15245,15328
201,He was by far the strongest of them all. ,15328,15369
202,"Soon after this event, news was brought to the city that a cannibal monster had taken up his abode not far away and that people were stricken with fear. ",15369,15522
203,Lord Raiko ordered Kintaro to the rescue. ,15522,15564
204,"He immediately started off, delighted at the prospect of trying his sword. ",15564,15639
205,"Surprising the monster in its den, he made short work of cutting off its great head, which he carried back in triumph to his master. ",15639,15772
206,"Kintaro now rose to be the greatest hero of his country, and great was the power and honor and wealth that came to him. ",15772,15892
207,"He now kept his promise and built a comfortable home for his old mother, who lived happily with him in the Capital to the end of her days. ",15892,16031
208,Is not this the story of a great hero?,16031,16070
