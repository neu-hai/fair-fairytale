0,Once upon a time there was a young man named Farquhar MacNeill. ,0,64
1,He had just gone to a new situation. ,64,101
2,The very first night after he went to it his mistress asked him if he would go over the hill to the house of a neighbour and borrow a sieve. ,101,242
3,Her own was all in holes. ,242,268
4,She wanted to sift some meal. ,268,298
5,Farquhar agreed to do so. ,298,324
6,He was a willing lad. ,324,346
7,"He set out at once upon his errand, after the farmer's wife had pointed out to him the path that he was to follow. ",346,461
8,"She told him that he would have no difficulty in finding the house, even though it was strange to him. ",461,564
9,He would be sure to see the light in the window. ,564,613
10,"He had not gone very far.However, before he saw what he took to be the light from a cottage window on his left hand, some distance from the path, and, forgetting his Mistress's instructions that he was to follow the path right over the hill. ",613,855
11,"He left it, and walked towards the light. ",855,897
12,It seemed to him that he had almost reached it when his foot tripped. ,897,967
13,"He fell down, down, down, into a Fairy Parlour, far under the ground. ",967,1037
14,"It was full of Fairies, who were engaged in different occupations. ",1037,1104
15,"Close by the door, or rather the hole down which he had so unceremoniously tumbled, two little elderly women, in black aprons and white mutches, were busily engaged in grinding corn between two flat millstones. ",1104,1315
16,"Other two Fairies, younger women, in blue print gowns and white kerchiefs, were gathering up the freshly ground meal. ",1315,1433
17,"They were baking it into bannocks, which they were toasting on a girdle over a peat fire. ",1433,1523
18,It was burning slowly in a corner. ,1523,1558
19,"In the centre of the large apartment a great troop of Fairies, Elves, and Sprites were dancing reels as hard as they could to the music of a tiny set of bagpipes. ",1558,1721
20,"They were being played by a brown-faced Gnome, who sat on a ledge of rock far above their heads. ",1721,1818
21,They all stopped their various employments when Farquhar came suddenly down in their midst. ,1818,1910
22,They looked at him in alarm. ,1910,1939
23,"When they saw that he was not hurt, they bowed gravely and bade him be seated. ",1939,2018
24,Then they went on with their work and with their play as if nothing had happened. ,2018,2100
25,"But Farquhar, being very fond of dancing, and being in no wise anxious to be seated, thought that he would like to have a reel first. ",2100,2234
26,He asked the Fairies if he might join them. ,2234,2278
27,"And they, although they looked surprised at his request, allowed him to do so. ",2278,2357
28,In a few minutes the young man was dancing away as gaily as any of them. ,2357,2430
29,And as he danced a strange change came over him. ,2430,2479
30,"He forgot his errand, he forgot his home, and he forgot everything that had ever happened to him. ",2479,2577
31,He only knew that he wanted to remain with the Fairies all the rest of his life. ,2577,2658
32,And he did remain with them. ,2658,2687
33,"A magic spell had been cast over him, and he became like one of themselves. ",2687,2763
34,He could come and go at nights without being seen. ,2763,2814
35,He could sip the dew from the grass and honey from the flowers as daintily and noiselessly as if he had been a Fairy born. ,2814,2937
36,"Time passed by, and one night he and a band of merry companions set out for a long journey through the air. ",2937,3045
37,They started early. ,3045,3065
38,They intended to pay a visit to the Man in the Moon and be back again before cock-crow. ,3065,3153
39,All would have gone well if Farquhar had only looked where he was going. ,3153,3226
40,"He did not, being deeply engaged in making love to a young Fairy Maiden by his side, so he never saw a cottage that was standing right in his way. ",3226,3373
41,He struck against the chimney and stuck fast in the thatch. ,3373,3433
42,"His companions sped merrily on, not noticing what had befallen him. ",3433,3501
43,He was left to disentangle himself as best he could. ,3501,3554
44,As he was doing so he chanced to glance down the wide chimney. ,3554,3617
45,In the cottage kitchen he saw a comely young woman dandling a rosy-cheeked baby. ,3617,3698
46,"Now, when Farquhar had been in his mortal state, he had been very fond of children. ",3698,3782
47,A word of blessing rose to his lips. ,3782,3819
48,"""God shield you,"" he said, as he looked at the mother and child, little guessing what the result of his words would be. ",3819,3939
49,For scarce had the Holy Name crossed his lips than the spell which had held him so long was broken. ,3939,4039
50,He became as he had been before. ,4039,4072
51,"Instantly his thoughts flew to his friends at home, and to the new Mistress whom he had left waiting for her sieve. ",4072,4188
52,He felt sure that some weeks must have elapsed since he set out to fetch it. ,4188,4265
53,So he made haste to go to the farm. ,4265,4301
54,When he arrived in the neighbourhood everything seemed strange. ,4301,4365
55,"There were woods where no woods used to be, and walls where no walls used to be. ",4365,4446
56,"To his amazement, he could not find his way to the farm. ",4446,4503
57,"Worst of all, in the place where he expected to find his father's house he found nothing but a crop of rank green nettles. ",4503,4626
58,In great distress he looked about for someone to tell him what it all meant. ,4626,4703
59,At last he found an old man thatching the roof of a cottage. ,4703,4764
60,This old man was so thin and grey that at first Farquhar took him for a patch of mist. ,4764,4851
61,"As he went nearer he saw that he was a human being, and, going close up to the wall and shouting with all his might. ",4851,4968
62,He felt sure that such an ancient man would be deaf. ,4968,5021
63,"He asked him if he could tell him where his friends had gone to, and what had happened to his father's dwelling. ",5021,5134
64,"The old man listened, then he shook his head. ",5134,5180
65,"""I never heard of him,"" he answered slowly; ",5180,5224
66," ""but perhaps my father might be able to tell you."" ",5223,5275
67,"""Your father!"" ",5275,5290
68,"said Farquhar, in great surprise. ",5290,5324
69,"""Is it possible that your father is alive?"" ",5324,5368
70,"""Aye he is,"" answered the old man, with a little laugh. ",5368,5424
71,"""If you go into the house you'll find him sitting in the arm-chair by the fire."" ",5424,5505
72,Farquhar did as he was bid. ,5505,5533
73,"On entering the cottage, he found another old man, who was so thin and withered and bent that he looked as if he must at least be a hundred years old. ",5533,5684
74,He was feebly twisting ropes to bind the thatch on the roof. ,5684,5745
75,"""Can you tell me anything of my friends, or where my father's cottage is?"" ",5745,5820
76,asked Farquhar again. ,5820,5842
77,He hardly expected that this second old man would be able to answer him. ,5842,5915
78,"""I cannot,"" mumbled this ancient person; ",5915,5956
79," ""but perhaps my father can tell you."" ",5955,5994
80,"""Your father!"" ",5275,5290
81,"exclaimed Farquhar, more astonished than ever. ",6009,6056
82,"""But surely he must be dead long ago."" ",6056,6095
83,The old man shook his head with a weird grimace. ,6095,6144
84,"""Look there,"" he said, and pointed with a twisted finger, to a leathern purse, or sporran, which was hanging to one of the posts of a wooden bedstead in the corner. ",6144,6309
85,Farquhar approached it. ,6309,6333
86,"He was almost frightened out of his wits by seeing a tiny shrivelled face crowned by a red pirnie, looking over the edge of the sporran. ",6333,6470
87,"""Take him out; ",6470,6485
88," he won't touch you,"" chuckled the old man by the fire. ",6484,6540
89,So Farquhar took the little creature out carefully between his finger and thumb. ,6540,6621
90,He set him on the palm of his left hand. ,6621,6662
91,He was so shrivelled with age that he looked just like a mummy. ,6662,6726
92,"""Dost know anything of my friends, or where my father's cottage is gone to?"" ",6726,6803
93,asked Farquhar. ,6803,6819
94,"For the third time, hehardly expected to get an answer. ",6819,6875
95,"""They were all dead long before I was born,"" piped out the tiny figure. ",6875,6947
96,"""I never saw any of them, but I have heard my father speak of them."" ",6947,7016
97,"""Then I must be older than you!"" ",7016,7049
98,"cried Farquhar, in great dismay. ",7049,7082
99,And he got such a shock at the thought that his bones suddenly dissolved into dust. ,7082,7166
100,"He fell, a heap of grey ashes, on the floor.",7166,7211
