0,Once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others. ,0,73
1,"He was never short of money, for he had a purse which was never empty. ",73,144
2,"He never was short of food, for he had a table-cloth on which, as soon as he spread it, he found all he wanted to eat and drink. ",144,273
3,"And, besides, he had a magic wishing cap. ",273,315
4,"When he put it on he could wish himself wherever he wanted, and there he would be that very moment. ",315,415
5,"There was only one thing that he lacked: he had no wife, and he was gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to make haste. ",415,565
6,"As he was walking sadly along one fine day, it occurred to him to wish himself where he would find the most beautiful princess in the world. ",565,706
7,No sooner had he thought of it than he was there. ,706,756
8,"And it was a land which he had never yet seen, and a city in which he had never yet been. ",756,846
9,"And the king had a daughter, so handsome that he had never yet beheld her like, and he wanted to have her on the spot. ",846,965
10,"But she would have nothing to do with him, and was very haughty. ",965,1030
11,"Finally he despaired altogether, and was so beside himself that he could no longer be where she was not. ",1030,1135
12,So he took his magic cap and wished himself into the castle. ,1135,1196
13,"He wanted to say good-by, so he said. ",1196,1234
14,And she laid her hand in his. ,1234,1264
15,"""I wish we were far beyond the end of the world!"" ",1264,1314
16,"said the youth, and there they were. ",1314,1351
17,"But the king's daughter wept, and begged to be allowed to go home again. ",1351,1424
18,He could have all the gold and silver in the castle in return. ,1424,1487
19,"""I have money enough for myself,"" said the youth, and he shook his purse so that money just rolled about. ",1487,1593
20,"He could sit down at the royal table and eat the finest food, and drink the finest wines, said she. ",1593,1693
21,"""I have enough to eat and drink myself,"" said the youth. ",1693,1750
22,"""See, you can sit down at the table,"" said he, and at once he spread his table-cloth. ",1750,1836
23,And there stood a table covered with the best one might wish; ,1836,1898
24, and the king himself ate no better. ,1897,1934
25,"After they had eaten, the king's daughter said: ""O, do look at the handsome apples up there on the tree! ",1934,2039
26,"If you were really kind, you would fetch me down a couple of them!"" ",2039,2107
27,"The youth was not lazy, and climbed up. ",2107,2147
28,"But he had forgotten his table-cloth and his purse, and these she took. ",2147,2219
29,And while he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off. ,2219,2278
30,"She at once put it on and wished herself back in her own room, and there she was that minute. ",2278,2372
31,"""You might have known it,"" said the youth to himself, and hurried down the tree. ",2372,2453
32,He began to cry and did not know what to do. ,2453,2498
33,"And as he was sitting there, he sampled the apples which he had thrown down. ",2498,2575
34,"No sooner had he tried one than he had a strange feeling in his head, and when he looked more closely, he had a pair of horns. ",2575,2702
35,"""Well, now it can do me no more harm,"" said he, and calmly went on eating the apples. ",2702,2788
36,"But suddenly the horns had disappeared, and he was as before. ",2788,2850
37,"""Good enough!"" ",2850,2865
38,said the youth. ,1734,1750
39,"And with that he put the apples in his pocket, and set out to search for the king's daughter. ",2881,2975
40,"He went from city to city, and sailed from country to country; ",2975,3038
41," but it was a long journey, and lasted a year and a day, and even longer. ",3037,3111
42,But one day he got there after all. ,3111,3147
43,"It was a Sunday, and he found out that the king's daughter was at church. ",3147,3221
44,"Then he sat himself down with his apples before the church door, and pretended to be a peddler. ",3221,3317
45,"""Apples of Damascus! ",3317,3338
46,"Apples of Damascus!"" ",3338,3359
47,he cried. ,3359,3369
48,"And sure enough, the king's daughter came, and told her maidens to go and see what desirable things the peddler from abroad might have to offer. ",3369,3514
49,"Yes, he had apples of Damascus. ",3514,3546
50,"""What do the apples give one?"" ",3546,3577
51,asked the maiden. ,3577,3595
52,"""Wisdom and beauty!"" ",3595,3616
53,"said the peddler, and the maiden bought. ",3616,3657
54,"When the king's daughter had eaten of the apples, she had a pair of horns. ",3657,3732
55,And then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was pitiful to hear. ,3732,3809
56,"And the castle was hung with black, and in the whole kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help the king's daughter should get her, and half the kingdom besides. ",3809,3999
57,"Then Tom, Dick and Harry, and the best physicians in the country came along. ",3999,4076
58,But none of them could help the princess. ,4076,4118
59,But one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court. ,4118,4172
60,"He was not from their country, he said, and had made the journey purposely just to try his luck here. ",4172,4274
61,"But he must see the king's daughter alone, said he, and permission was granted him. ",4274,4358
62,"The king's daughter recognized him, and grew red and pale in turn. ",4358,4425
63,"""If I help you now, will you marry me?"" ",4425,4465
64,asked the youth. ,4465,4482
65,"Yes, indeed she would. ",4482,4505
66,"Then he gave her one of the magic apples, and her horns were only half as large as before. ",4505,4596
67,"""But I cannot do more until I have my cap, and my table-cloth, and my purse back again,"" said he. ",4596,4694
68,So she went and brought him the things. ,4694,4734
69,"Then he gave her still another magic apple, and now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets. ",4734,4829
70,"""But now I cannot go on until you have sworn that you will be true to me,"" said he. ",4829,4913
71,And she swore that she would. ,4913,4943
72,"And after she had eaten the third apple, her forehead was quite smooth again, and she was even more beautiful than in days gone by. ",4943,5075
73,Then there was great joy in the castle. ,5075,5115
74,"They prepared for the wedding with baking and brewing, and invited people from East and West to come to it. ",5115,5223
75,"And they ate and drank, and were merry and of good cheer, and if they have not stopped, they are merry and of good cheer to this very day!",5223,5362
