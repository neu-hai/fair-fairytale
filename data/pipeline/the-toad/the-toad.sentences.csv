2,"Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters. ",175,286
3,"But as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well. ",286,392
4,Down below dwelt a family of the Toad race. ,392,436

6,"The green Frogs, who had been established there a long time, and swam about in the water, called them ""well-guests."" ",550,667
7,"But the new-comers seemed determined to stay where they were, for they found it very agreeable living ""in a dry place,"" as they called the wet stones. ",667,818
8,The Mother-Frog had once been a traveller. ,818,861
9,"She happened to be in the water-bucket when it was drawn up, but the light became too strong for her, and she got a pain in her eyes. ",861,995
10,Fortunately she scrambled out of the bucket. ,995,1040
11,"But she fell into the water with a terrible flop, and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back. ",1040,1149
12,"She certainly had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world. ",1149,1291
13,"The Mother-Toad might have told this and that, if she had chosen, but she never answered when they asked her anything, and so they left off asking. ",1291,1439

17,The young frogs listened and stared. ,1661,1698
18,"As these words did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water. ",1698,1785
19,"But the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere pride, for each of them thought that he must have the jewel. ",1785,1903
20,Then they sat and held their heads quite still. ,1903,1951

25,"""Well, I haven't got the jewel,"" said the smallest of the Toads; ",2310,2375

37,"That's just as if one of us were to say, ""Aha!"" ",2976,3024
38,"She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well, and to look over. ",3024,3100
39,"She felt such a longing for the green, up there. ",3100,3149
40,"The next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn up, filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the stone on which the Toad sat, the little creature's heart moved within it. ",3149,3358
41,"Our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently was drawn to the top, and emptied out. ",3358,3453

44,"""You're the ugliest thing I've seen for one while."" ",3539,3591
45,"And he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the toad, which just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles which grew high by the well's brink. ",3591,3755
46,"Here she saw stem by stem, but she looked up also. ",3755,3806
47,"The sun shone through the leaves, which were quite transparent. ",3806,3870
48,"She felt as a person would feel who steps suddenly into a great forest, where the sun looks in between the branches and leaves. ",3870,3998
49,"""It's much nicer here than down in the well! ",3998,4043
50,"I should like to stay here my whole life long!"" ",4043,4091

55,And so she crawled on as fast as she could crawl. ,4258,4308
56,"She got out upon the highway, where the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over as she marched across the way. ",4308,4434
57,"""I've got to a dry place now, and no mistake,"" said the Toad. ",4434,4496
58,"""It's almost too much of a good thing here; ",4496,4540

60,She came to the ditch. ,4560,4583
61,"Forget-me-nots were growing there, and meadow-sweet. ",4583,4636
62,"A very little way off was a hedge of whitethorn, and elder bushes grew there, too, and bindweed with white flowers. ",4636,4752
63,"Gay colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly, too, was flitting by. ",4752,4824
64,"The Toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that it might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural thing to do. ",4824,4965

91, we know the sort of thing. ,6073,6101
92,"No refreshments were given, only there was plenty to drink, for the whole pond was free. ",6101,6190
93,"""Now I shall resume my journey,"" said the little Toad. ",6190,6245
94,She always felt a longing for something better. ,6245,6293
95,"She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw the moon gleaming. ",6293,6375
