0,"Once upon a time there lived a King and Queen, who were the best creatures in the world, and so kind-hearted that they could not bear to see their subjects want for anything. ",0,175
1,"The consequence was that they gradually gave away all their treasures, till they positively had nothing left to live upon; ",175,298
2," and this coming to the ears of their neighbour, King Bruin, he promptly raised a large army and marched into their country. ",297,422
3,"The poor King, having no means of defending his kingdom, was forced to disguise himself with a false beard, and carrying his only son, the little Prince Featherhead, in his arms, and accompanied only by the Queen, to make the best of his way into the wild country. ",422,687
4,"They were lucky enough to escape the soldiers of King Bruin, and at last, after unheard-of fatigues and adventures, they found themselves in a charming green valley, through which flowed a stream clear as crystal and overshadowed by beautiful trees. ",687,937
5,"As they looked round them with delight, a voice said suddenly: 'Fish, and see what you will catch.' ",937,1037
6,"Now the King had always loved fishing, and never went anywhere without a fish-hook or two in his pocket, so he drew one out hastily, and the Queen lent him her girdle to fasten it to, and it had hardly touched the water before it caught a big fish, which made them an excellent meal--and not before they needed it, for they had found nothing until then but a few wild berries and roots. ",1037,1424
7,"They thought that for the present they could not do better than stay in this delightful place, and the King set to work, and soon built a bower of branches to shelter them; ",1424,1597
8," and when it was finished the Queen was so charmed with it that she declared nothing was lacking to complete her happiness but a flock of sheep, which she and the little Prince might tend while the King fished. ",1596,1807
9,"They soon found that the fish were not only abundant and easily caught, but also very beautiful, with glittering scales of every imaginable hue; ",1807,1952
10, and before long the King discovered that he could teach them to talk and whistle better than any parrot. ,1951,2057
11,Then he determined to carry some to the nearest town and try to sell them; ,2057,2132
12," and as no one had ever before seen any like them the people flocked about him eagerly and bought all he had caught, so that presently not a house in the city was considered complete without a crystal bowl full of fish, and the King's customers were very particular about having them to match the rest of the furniture, and gave him a vast amount of trouble in choosing them. ",2131,2507
13,"However, the money he obtained in this way enabled him to buy the Queen her flock of sheep, as well as many of the other things which go to make life pleasant, so that they never once regretted their lost kingdom. ",2507,2721
14,"Now it happened that the Fairy of the Beech-Woods lived in the lovely valley to which chance had led the poor fugitives, and it was she who had, in pity for their forlorn condition, sent the King such good luck to his fishing, and generally taken them under her protection. ",2721,2995
15,"This she was all the more inclined to do as she loved children, and little Prince Featherhead, who never cried and grew prettier day by day, quite won her heart. ",2995,3157
16,"She made the acquaintance of the King and the Queen without at first letting them know that she was a fairy, and they soon took a great fancy to her, and even trusted her with the precious Prince, whom she carried off to her palace, where she regaled him with cakes and tarts and every other good thing. ",3157,3461
17,This was the way she chose of making him fond of her; ,3461,3515
18," but afterwards, as he grew older, she spared no pains in educating and training him as a prince should be trained. ",3514,3630
19,"But unfortunately, in spite of all her care, he grew so vain and frivolous that he quitted his peaceful country life in disgust, and rushed eagerly after all the foolish gaieties of the neighbouring town, where his handsome face and charming manners speedily made him popular. ",3630,3907
20,"The King and Queen deeply regretted this alteration in their son, but did not know how to mend matters, since the good old Fairy had made him so self-willed. ",3907,4065
21,"Just at this time the Fairy of the Beech-Woods received a visit from an old friend of hers called Saradine, who rushed into her house so breathless with rage that she could hardly speak. ",4065,4252
22,"'Dear, dear! ",4252,4265
23,what is the matter?' ,4265,4286
24,said the Fairy of the Beech-Woods soothingly. ,4286,4332
25,'The matter!' ,4332,4346
26,cried Saradine. ,4346,4362
27,'You shall soon hear all about it. ,4362,4397
28,"You know that, not content with endowing Celandine, Princess of the Summer Islands, with everything she could desire to make her charming, I actually took the trouble to bring her up myself; ",4397,4588
29, and now what does she do but come to me with more coaxings and caresses than usual to beg a favour. ,4587,4688
30,And what do you suppose this favour turns out to be--when I have been cajoled into promising to grant it?' ,4688,4795
31,"""Nothing more nor less than a request that I will take back all my gifts--since,"" says my young madam, ""if I have the good fortune to please you, how am I to know that it is really I, myself? ",4795,4987
32,"And that's how it will be all my life long, whenever I meet anybody. ",4987,5056
33,"You see what a weariness my life will be to me under these circumstances, and yet I assure you I am not ungrateful to you for all your kindness!"" ",5056,5202
34,"'I did all I could,' continued Saradine, 'to make her think better of it, but in vain; ",5202,5289
35," so after going through the usual ceremony for taking back my gifts, I'm come to you for a little peace and quietness. ",5288,5407
36,"But, after all, I have not taken anything of consequence from this provoking Celandine. ",5407,5495
37,"Nature had already made her so pretty, and given her such a ready wit of her own, that she will do perfectly well without me. ",5495,5621
38,"However, I thought she deserved a little lesson, so to begin with I have whisked her off into the desert, and there left her!' ",5621,5748
39,'What! ,5748,5755
40,"all alone, and without any means of existence?' ",5755,5803
41,cried the kind-hearted old Fairy. ,5803,5837
42,'You had better hand her over to me. ,5837,5874
43,I don't think so very badly of her after all. ,5874,5920
44,I'll just cure her vanity by making her love someone better than herself. ,5920,5994
45,"Really, when I come to consider of it, I declare the little minx has shown more spirit and originality in the matter than one expects of a princess.' ",5994,6144
46,"Saradine willingly consented to this arrangement, and the old Fairy's first care was to smooth away all the difficulties which surrounded the Princess, and lead her by the mossy path overhung with trees to the bower of the King and Queen, who still pursued their peaceful life in the valley. ",6144,6436
47,"They were immensely surprised at her appearance, but her charming face, and the deplorably ragged condition to which the thorns and briers had reduced her once elegant attire, speedily won their compassion; ",6436,6643
48," they recognised her as a companion in misfortune, and the Queen welcomed her heartily, and begged her to share their simple repast. ",6642,6775
49,"Celandine gracefully accepted their hospitality, and soon told them what had happened to her. ",6775,6869
50,"The King was charmed with her spirit, while the Queen thought she had indeed been daring thus to go against the Fairy's wishes. ",6869,6997
51,"'Since it has ended in my meeting you,' said the Princess, 'I cannot regret the step I have taken, and if you will let me stay with you, I shall be perfectly happy.' ",6997,7163
52,"The King and Queen were only too delighted to have this charming Princess to supply the place of Prince Featherhead, whom they saw but seldom, since the Fairy had provided him with a palace in the neighbouring town, where he lived in the greatest luxury, and did nothing but amuse himself from morning to night. ",7163,7475
53,"So Celandine stayed, and helped the Queen to keep house, and very soon they loved her dearly. ",7475,7569
54,"When the Fairy of the Beech-Woods came to them, they presented the Princess to her, and told her story, little thinking that the Fairy knew more about Celandine than they did. ",7569,7745
55,"The old Fairy was equally delighted with her, and often invited her to visit her Leafy Palace, which was the most enchanting place that could be imagined, and full of treasures. ",7745,7923
56,"Often she would say to the Princess, when showing her some wonderful thing: 'This will do for a wedding gift some day.' ",7923,8043
57,"And Celandine could not help thinking that it was to her that the Fairy meant to give the two blue wax-torches which burned without ever getting smaller, or the diamond from which more diamonds were continually growing, or the boat that sailed under water, or whatever beautiful or wonderful thing they might happen to be looking at. ",8043,8377
58,"It is true that she never said so positively, but she certainly allowed the Princess to believe it, because she thought a little disappointment would be good for her. ",8377,8544
59,But the person she really relied upon for curing Celandine of her vanity was Prince Featherhead. ,8544,8641
60,"The old Fairy was not at all pleased with the way he had been going on for some time, but her heart was so soft towards him that she was unwilling to take him away from the pleasures he loved, except by offering him something better, which is not the most effectual mode of correction, though it is without doubt the most agreeable. ",8641,8974
61,"However, she did not even hint to the Princess that Featherhead was anything but absolutely perfect, and talked of him so much that when at last she announced that he was coming to visit her, Celandine made up her mind that this delightful Prince would be certain to fall in love with her at once, and was quite pleased at the idea. ",8974,9307
62,"The old Fairy thought so too, but as this was not at all what she wished, she took care to throw such an enchantment over the Princess that she appeared to Featherhead quite ugly and awkward, though to every one else she looked just as usual. ",9307,9550
63,"So when he arrived at the Leafy Palace, more handsome and fascinating even than ever she had been led to expect, he hardly so much as glanced at the Princess, but bestowed all his attention upon the old Fairy, to whom he seemed to have a hundred things to say. ",9550,9811
64,"The Princess was immensely astonished at his indifference, and put on a cold and offended air, which, however, he did not seem to observe. ",9811,9950
65,"Then as a last resource she exerted all her wit and gaiety to amuse him, but with no better success, for he was of an age to be more attracted by beauty than by anything else, and though he responded politely enough, it was evident that his thoughts were elsewhere. ",9950,10216
66,"Celandine was deeply mortified, since for her part the Prince pleased her very well, and for the first time she bitterly regretted the fairy gifts she had been anxious to get rid of. ",10216,10399
67,"Prince Featherhead was almost equally puzzled, for he had heard nothing from the King and Queen but the praises of this charming Princess, and the fact that they had spoken of her as so very beautiful only confirmed his opinion that people who live in the country have no taste. ",10399,10678
68,"He talked to them of his charming acquaintances in the town, the beauties he had admired, did admire, or thought he was going to admire, until Celandine, who heard it all, was ready to cry with vexation. ",10678,10882
69,"The Fairy too was quite shocked at his conceit, and hit upon a plan for curing him of it. ",10882,10972
70,"She sent to him by an unknown messenger a portrait of Princess Celandine as she really was, with this inscription: 'All this beauty and sweetness, with a loving heart and a great kingdom, might have been yours but for your well-known fickleness.' ",10972,11219
71,"This message made a great impression upon the Prince, but not so much as the portrait. ",11219,11306
72,"He positively could not tear his eyes away from it, and exclaimed aloud that never, never had he seen anything so lovely and so graceful. ",11306,11444
73,"Then he began to think that it was too absurd that he, the fascinating Featherhead, should fall in love with a portrait; ",11444,11565
74," and, to drive away the recollections of its haunting eyes, he rushed back to the town; ",11564,11652
75, but somehow everything seemed changed. ,11651,11691
76,"The beauties no longer pleased him, their witty speeches had ceased to amuse; ",11691,11769
77," and indeed, for their parts, they found the Prince far less amiable than of yore, and were not sorry when he declared that, after all, a country life suited him best, and went back to the Leafy Palace. ",11768,11971
78,"Meanwhile, the Princess Celandine had been finding the time pass but slowly with the King and Queen, and was only too pleased when Featherhead reappeared. ",11971,12126
79,"She at once noticed the change in him, and was deeply curious to find the reason of it. ",12126,12214
80,"Far from avoiding her, he now sought her company and seemed to take pleasure in talking to her, and yet the Princess did not for a moment flatter herself with the idea that he was in love with her, though it did not take her long to decide that he certainly loved someone. ",12214,12487
81,"But one day the Princess, wandering sadly by the river, spied Prince Featherhead fast asleep in the shade of a tree, and stole nearer to enjoy the delight of gazing at his dear face unobserved. ",12487,12681
82,Judge of her astonishment when she saw that he was holding in his hand a portrait of herself! ,12681,12775
83,In vain did she puzzle over the apparent contradictoriness of his behaviour. ,12775,12852
84,Why did he cherish her portrait while he was so fatally indifferent to herself? ,12852,12932
85,At last she found an opportunity of asking him the name of the Princess whose picture he carried about with him always. ,12932,13052
86,'Alas! ,13052,13059
87,how can I tell you?' ,13059,13080
88,replied he. ,13080,13092
89,'Why should you not?' ,13092,13114
90,said the Princess timidly. ,13114,13141
91,'Surely there is nothing to prevent you.' ,13141,13183
92,'Nothing to prevent me!' ,13183,13208
93,"repeated he, 'when my utmost efforts have failed to discover the lovely original. ",13208,13290
94,Should I be so sad if I could but find her? ,13290,13334
95,But I do not even know her name.' ,13334,13368
96,"More surprised than ever, the Princess asked to be allowed to see the portrait, and after examining it for a few minutes returned it, remarking shyly that at least the original had every cause to be satisfied with it. ",13368,13586
97,"'That means that you consider it flattered,' said the Prince severely. ",13586,13657
98,"'Really, Celandine, I thought better of you, and should have expected you to be above such contemptible jealousy. ",13657,13771
99,But all women are alike!' ,13771,13797
100,"'Indeed, I meant only that it was a good likeness,' said the Princess meekly. ",13797,13875
101,"'Then you know the original,' cried the Prince, throwing himself on his knees beside her. ",13875,13965
102,"'Pray tell me at once who it is, and don't keep me in suspense!' ",13965,14030
103,'Oh! ,14030,14035
104,don't you see that it is meant for me?' ,14035,14075
105,cried Celandine. ,14075,14092
106,"The Prince sprang to his feet, hardly able to refrain from telling her that she must be blinded by vanity to suppose she resembled the lovely portrait even in the slightest degree; ",14092,14273
107," and after gazing at her for an instant with icy surprise, turned and left her without another word, and in a few hours quitted the Leafy Palace altogether. ",14272,14429
108,"Now the Princess was indeed unhappy, and could no longer bear to stay in a place where she had been so cruelly disdained. ",14429,14551
109,"So, without even bidding farewell to the King and Queen, she left the valley behind her, and wandered sadly away, not caring whither. ",14551,14685
110,"After walking until she was weary, she saw before her a tiny house, and turned her slow steps towards it. ",14685,14791
111,"The nearer she approached the more miserable it appeared, and at length she saw a little old woman sitting upon the door-step, who said grimly: 'Here comes one of these fine beggars who are too idle to do anything but run about the country!' ",14791,15033
112,'Alas! ,13052,13059
113,"madam,' said Celandine, with tears in her pretty eyes, 'a sad fate forces me to ask you for shelter.' ",15040,15142
114,'Didn't I tell you what it would be?' ,15142,15180
115,growled the old hag. ,15180,15201
116,"'From shelter we shall proceed to demand supper, and from supper money to take us on our way. ",15201,15295
117,"Upon my word, if I could be sure of finding some one every day whose head was as soft as his heart, I wouldn't wish for a more agreeable life myself! ",15295,15445
118,"But I have worked hard to build my house and secure a morsel to eat, and I suppose you think that I am to give away everything to the first passer-by who chooses to ask for it. ",15445,15622
119,Not at all! ,15622,15634
120,I wager that a fine lady like you has more money than I have. ,15634,15696
121,"I must search her, and see if it is not so,' she added, hobbling towards Celandine with the aid of her stick. ",15696,15806
122,'Alas! ,13052,13059
123,"madam,' replied the Princess, 'I only wish I had. ",15813,15863
124,I would give it to you with all the pleasure in life.' ,15863,15918
125,"'But you are very smartly dressed for the kind of life you lead,' continued the old woman. ",15918,16009
126,'What!' ,16009,16017
127,"cried the Princess, 'do you think I am come to beg of you?' ",16017,16077
128,"'I don't know about that,' answered she; ",16077,16118
129, 'but at any rate you don't seem to have come to bring me anything. ,16117,16185
130,But what is it that you do want? ,16185,16218
131,Shelter? ,16218,16227
132,"Well, that does not cost much; ",16227,16258
133," but after that comes supper, and that I can't hear of. ",16257,16313
134,Oh dear no! ,16313,16325
135,"Why, at your age one is always ready to eat; ",16325,16370
136," and now you have been walking, and I suppose you are ravenous?' ",16369,16434
137,"'Indeed no, madam,' answered the poor Princess, 'I am too sad to be hungry.' ",16434,16511
138,"'Oh, well! ",16511,16522
139,"if you will promise to go on being sad, you may stay for the night,' said the old woman mockingly. ",16522,16621
140,"There upon she made the Princess sit down beside her, and began fingering her silken robe, while she muttered 'Lace on top, lace underneath! ",16621,16762
141,This must have cost you a pretty penny! ,16762,16802
142,"It would have been better to save enough to feed yourself, and not come begging to those who want all they have for themselves. ",16802,16930
143,"Pray, what may you have paid for these fine clothes?' ",16930,16984
144,'Alas! ,13052,13059
145,"madam,' answered the Princess, 'I did not buy them, and I know nothing about money.' ",16991,17076
146,"'What do you know, if I may ask?' ",17076,17110
147,said the old dame. ,17110,17129
148,'Not much; ,17129,17140
149," but indeed I am very unhappy,' cried Celandine, bursting into tears, 'and if my services are any good to you--' 'Services!' ",17139,17264
150,interrupted the hag crossly. ,17264,17293
151,"'One has to pay for services, and I am not above doing my own work.' ",17293,17362
152,"'Madam, I will serve you for nothing,' said the poor Princess, whose spirits were sinking lower and lower. ",17362,17469
153,'I will do anything you please; ,17469,17501
154, all I wish is to live quietly in this lonely spot.' ,17500,17553
155,'Oh! ,14030,14035
156,"I know you are only trying to take me in,' answered she; ",17558,17615
157," 'and if I do let you serve me, is it fitting that you should be so much better dressed I am? ",17614,17708
158,"If I keep you, will you give me your clothes and wear some that I will provide you with? ",17708,17797
159,It is true that I am getting old and may want someone to take care of me some day.' ,17797,17881
160,'Oh! ,14030,14035
161,"for pity's sake, do what you please with my clothes,' cried poor Celandine miserably. ",17886,17972
162,"And the old woman hobbled off with great alacrity, and fetched a little bundle containing a wretched dress, such as the Princess had never even seen before, and nimbly skipped round, helping her to put it on instead of her own rich robe, with many exclamations of: 'Saints!--what a magnificent lining! ",17972,18274
163,And the width of it! ,18274,18295
164,It will make me four dresses at least. ,18295,18334
165,"Why, child, I wonder you could walk under such a weight, and certainly in my house you would not have had room to turn round.' ",18334,18461
166,"So saying, she folded up the robe, and put it by with great care, while she remarked to Celandine: 'That dress of mine certainly suits you to a marvel; ",18461,18613
167, be sure you take great care of it.' ,18612,18649
168,"When supper-time came she went into the house, declining all the Princess's offers of assistance, and shortly afterwards brought out a very small dish, saying: 'Now let us sup.' ",18649,18827
169,"Whereupon she handed Celandine a small piece of black bread and uncovered the dish, which contained two dried plums. ",18827,18944
170,"'We will have one between us,' continued the old dame; ",18944,18999
171," 'and as you are the visitor, you shall have the half which contains the stone; ",18998,19078
172," but be very careful that you don't swallow it, for I keep them against the winter, and you have no idea what a good fire they make. ",19077,19210
173,"Now, you take my advice--which won't cost you anything--and remember that it is always more economical to buy fruit with stones on this account.' ",19210,19356
174,"Celandine, absorbed in her own sad thoughts, did not even hear this prudent counsel, and quite forgot to eat her share of the plum, which delighted the old woman, who put it by carefully for her breakfast, saying: 'I am very much pleased with you, and if you go on as you have begun, we shall do very well, and I can teach you many useful things which people don't generally know. ",19356,19737
175,"For instance, look at my house! ",19737,19769
176,It is built entirely of the seeds of all the pears I have eaten in my life. ,19769,19845
177,"Now, most people throw them away, and that only shows what a number of things are wasted for want of a little patience and ingenuity.' ",19845,19980
178,But Celandine did not find it possible to be interested in this and similar pieces of advice. ,19980,20074
179,"And the old woman soon sent her to bed, for fear the night air might give her an appetite. ",20074,20165
180,She passed a sleepless night; ,20165,20195
181, but in the morning the old dame remarked: 'I heard how well you slept. ,20194,20266
182,After such a night you cannot want any breakfast; ,20266,20316
183," so while I do my household tasks you had better stay in bed, since the more one sleeps the less one need eat; ",20315,20426
184, and as it is market-day I will go to town and buy a pennyworth of bread for the week's eating.' ,20425,20522
185,"And so she chattered on, but poor Celandine did not hear or heed her; ",20522,20592
186, she wandered out into the desolate country to think over her sad fate. ,20591,20663
187,"However, the good Fairy of the Beech-Woods did not want her to be starved, so she sent her an unlooked for relief in the shape of a beautiful white cow, which followed her back to the tiny house. ",20663,20859
188,When the old woman saw it her joy knew no bounds. ,20859,20909
189,'Now we can have milk and cheese and butter!' ,20909,20955
190,cried she. ,20955,20966
191,'Ah! ,20966,20971
192,how good milk is! ,20971,20989
193,What a pity it is so ruinously expensive!' ,20989,21032
194,"So they made a little shelter of branches for the beautiful creature which was quite gentle, and followed Celandine about like a dog when she took it out every day to graze. ",21032,21206
195,"One morning as she sat by a little brook, thinking sadly, she suddenly saw a young stranger approaching, and got up quickly, intending to avoid him. ",21206,21355
196,"But Prince Featherhead, for it was he, perceiving her at the same moment, rushed towards her with every demonstration of joy: for he had recognised her, not as the Celandine whom he had slighted, but as the lovely Princess whom he had sought vainly for so long. ",21355,21617
197,"The fact was that the Fairy of the Beech-Woods, thinking she had been punished enough, had withdrawn the enchantment from her, and transferred it to Featherhead, thereby in an instant depriving him of the good looks which had done so much towards making him the fickle creature he was. ",21617,21903
198,"Throwing himself down at the Princess's feet, he implored her to stay, and at least speak to him, and she at last consented, but only because he seemed to wish it so very much. ",21903,22080
199,"After that he came every day in the hope of meeting her again, and often expressed his delight at being with her. ",22080,22194
200,"But one day, when he had been begging Celandine to love him, she confided to him that it was quite impossible, since her heart was already entirely occupied by another. ",22194,22363
201,"'I have,' said she, 'the unhappiness of loving a Prince who is fickle, frivolous, proud, incapable of caring for anyone but himself, who has been spoilt by flattery, and, to crown all, who does not love me.' ",22363,22571
202,"'But,' cried Prince Featherhead, 'surely you cannot care for so contemptible and worthless a creature as that.' ",22571,22683
203,'Alas! ,13052,13059
204,"but I do care,' answered the Princess, weeping. ",22690,22738
205,"'But where can his eyes be,' said the Prince, 'that your beauty makes no impression upon him? ",22738,22832
206,"As for me, since I have possessed your portrait I have wandered over the whole world to find you, and, now we have met, I see that you are ten times lovelier than I could have imagined, and I would give all I own to win your love.' ",22832,23064
207,'My portrait?' ,23064,23079
208,cried Celandine with sudden interest. ,23079,23117
209,'Is it possible that Prince Featherhead can have parted with it?' ,23117,23183
210,"'He would part with his life sooner, lovely Princess,' answered he; ",23183,23251
211," 'I can assure you of that, for I am Prince Featherhead.' ",23250,23308
212,"At the same moment the Fairy of the Beech-Woods took away the enchantment, and the happy Princess recognised her lover, now truly hers, for the trials they had both undergone had so changed and improved them that they were capable of a real love for each other. ",23308,23570
213,"You may imagine how perfectly happy they were, and how much they had to hear and to tell. ",23570,23660
214,"But at length it was time to go back to the little house, and as they went along Celandine remembered for the first time what a ragged old dress she was wearing, and what an odd appearance she must present. ",23660,23867
215,"But the Prince declared that it became her vastly, and that he thought it most picturesque. ",23867,23959
216,When they reached the house the old woman received them very crossly. ,23959,24029
217,"'I declare,' said she, 'that it's perfectly true: wherever there is a girl you may be sure that a young man will appear before long! ",24029,24162
218,"But don't imagine that I'm going to have you here--not a bit of it, be off with you, my fine fellow!' ",24162,24264
219,"Prince Featherhead was inclined to be angry at this uncivil reception, but he was really too happy to care much, so he only demanded, on Celandine's behalf, that the old dame should give her back her own attire, that she might go away suitably dressed. ",24264,24517
220,"This request roused her to fury, since she had counted upon the Princess's fine robes to clothe her for the rest of her life, so that it was some time before the Prince could make himself heard to explain that he was willing to pay for them. ",24517,24759
221,"The sight of a handful of gold pieces somewhat mollified her, however, and after making them both promise faithfully that on no consideration would they ask for the gold back again, she took the Princess into the house and grudgingly doled out to her just enough of her gay attire to make her presentable, while the rest she pretended to have lost. ",24759,25108
222,"After this they found that they were very hungry, for one cannot live on love, any more than on air, and then the old woman's lamentations were louder than before. ",25108,25272
223,'What!' ,16009,16017
224,"she cried, 'feed people who were as happy as all that! ",25280,25335
225,"Why, it was simply ruinous!' ",25335,25364
226,"But as the Prince began to look angry, she, with many sighs and mutterings, brought out a morsel of bread, a bowl of milk, and six plums, with which the lovers were well content: for as long as they could look at one another they really did not know what they were eating. ",25364,25637
227,"It seemed as if they would go on for ever with their reminiscences, the Prince telling how he had wandered all over the world from beauty to beauty, always to be disappointed when he found that no one resembled the portrait; ",25637,25862
228," the Princess wondering how it was he could have been so long with her and yet never have recognised her, and over and over again pardoning him for his cold and haughty behaviour to her. ",25861,26048
229,"'For,' she said, 'you see, Featherhead, I love you, and love makes everything right! ",26048,26133
230,"But we cannot stay here,' she added; ",26133,26170
231, 'what are we to do?' ,26169,26191
232,"The Prince thought they had better find their way to the Fairy of the Beech-Woods and put themselves once more under her protection, and they had hardly agreed upon this course when two little chariots wreathed with jasmine and honeysuckle suddenly appeared, and, stepping into them, they were whirled away to the Leafy Palace. ",26191,26519
233,"Just before they lost sight of the little house they heard loud cries and lamentations from the miserly old dame, and, looking round, perceived that the beautiful cow was vanishing in spite of her frantic efforts to hold it fast. ",26519,26749
234,And they afterwards heard that she spent the rest of her life in trying to put the handful of gold the Prince had thrown to her into her money-bag. ,26749,26897
235,"For the Fairy, as a punishment for her avarice, caused it to slip out again as fast as she dropped it in. ",26897,27003
236,"The Fairy of the Beech-Woods ran to welcome the Prince and Princess with open arms, only too delighted to find them so much improved that she could, with a clear conscience, begin to spoil them again. ",27003,27204
237,"Very soon the Fairy Saradine also arrived, bringing the King and Queen with her. ",27204,27285
238,"Princess Celandine implored her pardon, which she graciously gave; ",27285,27352
239, indeed the Princess was so charming she could refuse her nothing. ,27351,27418
240,"She also restored to her the Summer Islands, and promised her protection in all things. ",27418,27506
241,"The Fairy of the Beech-Woods then informed the King and Queen that their subjects had chased King Bruin from the throne, and were waiting to welcome them back again; ",27506,27672
242," but they at once abdicated in favour of Prince Featherhead, declaring that nothing could induce them to forsake their peaceful life, and the Fairies undertook to see the Prince and Princess established in their beautiful kingdoms. ",27671,27903
243,"Their marriage took place the next day, and they lived happily ever afterwards, for Celandine was never vain and Featherhead was never fickle any more.",27903,28055
