0,There was once a king who had three daughters. ,0,47
1,"The two eldest were very proud and quarrelsome, but the youngest was as good as they were bad. ",47,142
2,"Well, three princes came to court them, and two of them were exactly like the eldest ladies, and one was just as lovable as the youngest. ",142,280
3,One day they were all walking down to a lake that lay at the bottom of the lawn when they met a poor beggar. ,280,389
4,"The king wouldn't give him anything, and the eldest princesses wouldn't give him anything, nor their sweethearts; ",389,503
5," but the youngest daughter and her true love did give him something, and kind words along with it, and that was better than all. ",502,631
6,When they got to the edge of the lake what did they find but the beautifullest boat you ever saw in your life; ,631,742
7," and says the eldest, 'I'll take a sail in this fine boat';",741,800
8," and says the second eldest, 'I'll take a sail in this fine boat';",800,866
9," and says the youngest, 'I won't take a sail in that fine boat, for I am afraid it's an enchanted one.' ",866,970
10,"But the others persuaded her to go in, and her father was just going in after her, when up sprung on the deck a little man only seven inches high, and ordered him to stand back. ",970,1148
11,"Well, all the men put their hands to their swords; ",1148,1199
12," and if the same swords were only playthings, they weren't able to draw them, for all strength that was left their arms. ",1198,1319
13,"Seven Inches loosened the silver chain that fastened the boat, and pushed away, and after grinning at the four men, says he to them. ",1319,1452
14,'Bid your daughters and your brides farewell for awhile. ,1452,1509
15,"You,' says he to the youngest, 'needn't fear, you'll recover your princess all in good time, and you and she will be as happy as the day is long. ",1509,1655
16,"Bad people, if they were rolling stark naked in gold, would not be rich. ",1655,1728
17,Good-bye.' ,1728,1739
18,"Away they sailed, and the ladies stretched out their hands, but weren't able to say a word. ",1739,1831
19,"Well, they weren't crossing the lake while a cat would be lickin' her ear, and the poor men couldn't stir hand or foot to follow them. ",1831,1966
20,"They saw Seven Inches handing the three princesses out of the boat, and letting them down by a basket into a draw-well, but king nor princes ever saw an opening before in the same place. ",1966,2153
21,"When the last lady was out of sight, the men found the strength in their arms and legs again. ",2153,2247
22,"Round the lake they ran, and never drew rein till they came to the well and windlass; ",2247,2333
23," and there was the silk rope rolled on the axle, and the nice white basket hanging to it. ",2332,2422
24,"'Let me down,' says the youngest prince. ",2422,2463
25,'I'll die or recover them again.' ,2463,2497
26,"'No,' says the second daughter's sweetheart, 'it is my turn first.' ",2497,2565
27,"And says the other, 'I am the eldest.' ",2565,2604
28,"So they gave way to him, and in he got into the basket, and down they let him. ",2604,2683
29,"First they lost sight of him, and then, after winding off a hundred perches of the silk rope, it slackened, and they stopped turning. ",2683,2817
30,"They waited two hours, and then they went to dinner, because there was no pull made at the rope. ",2817,2914
31,"Guards were set till next morning, and then down went the second prince, and sure enough, the youngest of all got himself let down on the third day. ",2914,3063
32,"He went down perches and perches, while it was as dark about him as if he was in a big pot with a cover on. ",3063,3171
33,"At last he saw a glimmer far down, and in a short time he felt the ground. ",3171,3246
34,"Out he came from the big lime-kiln, and, lo! ",3246,3291
35,"and behold you, there was a wood, and green fields, and a castle in a lawn, and a bright sky over all. ",3291,3394
36,"'It's in Tir-na-n-Oge I am,' says he. ",3394,3432
37,'Let's see what sort of people are in the castle.' ,3432,3483
38,"On he walked, across fields and lawn, and no one was there to keep him out or let him into the castle; ",3483,3586
39, but the big hall-door was wide open. ,3585,3623
40,"He went from one fine room to another that was finer, and at last he reached the handsomest of all, with a table in the middle. ",3623,3751
41,And such a dinner as was laid upon it! ,3751,3790
42,"The prince was hungry enough, but he was too mannerly to eat without being invited. ",3790,3874
43,"So he sat by the fire, and he did not wait long till he heard steps, and in came Seven Inches with the youngest sister by the hand. ",3874,4006
44,"Well, prince and princess flew into one another's arms, and says the little man, says he, 'Why aren't you eating?' ",4006,4121
45,"'I think, sir,' says the prince, 'it was only good manner to wait to be asked.' ",4121,4201
46,"'The other princes didn't think so,' says he. ",4201,4247
47,"'Each of them fell to without leave, and only gave me the rough words when I told them they were making more free than welcome. ",4247,4375
48,"Well, I don't think they feel much hunger now. ",4375,4422
49,"There they are, good marble instead of flesh and blood,' says he, pointing to two statues, one in one corner, and the other in the other corner of the room. ",4422,4579
50,"The prince was frightened, but he was afraid to say anything, and Seven Inches made him sit down to dinner between himself and his bride; ",4579,4717
51," and he'd be as happy as the day is long, only for the sight of the stone men in the corner. ",4716,4809
52,"Well, that day went by, and when the next came, says Seven Inches to him, 'Now, you'll have to set out that way,' pointing to the sun, 'and you'll find the second princess in a giant's castle this evening, when you'll be tired and hungry, and the eldest princess to-morrow evening; ",4809,5091
53, and you may as well bring them here with you. ,5090,5137
54,You need not ask leave of their masters; ,5137,5178
55," and perhaps if they ever get home, they'll look on poor people as if they were flesh and blood like themselves.' ",5177,5291
56,"Away went the prince, and bedad! ",5291,5324
57,"it's tired and hungry he was when he reached the first castle, at sunset. ",5324,5398
58,"Oh, wasn't the second princess glad to see him! ",5398,5446
59,And what a good supper she gave him. ,5446,5483
60,"But she heard the giant at the gate, and she hid the prince in a closet. ",5483,5556
61,"Well, when he came in, he snuffed, an' he snuffed, and says he, 'By the life, I smell fresh meat.' ",5556,5655
62,"'Oh,' says the princess, 'it's only the calf I got killed to-day.' ",5655,5722
63,"'Ay, ay,' says he, 'is supper ready?' ",5722,5760
64,"'It is,' says she; ",5760,5779
65," and before he rose from the table he ate three-quarters of a calf, and a flask of wine. ",5778,5867
66,"'I think,' says he, when all was done, 'I smell fresh meat still.' ",5867,5934
67,"'It's sleepy you are,' says she; ",5934,5967
68, 'go to bed.' ,5966,5980
69,'When will you marry me?' ,5980,6006
70,says the giant. ,6006,6022
71,'You're putting me off too long.' ,6022,6056
72,'St. ,6056,6061
73,"Tibb's Eve,' says she. ",6061,6084
74,"'I wish I knew how far off that is,' says he; ",6084,6130
75," and he fell asleep, with his head in the dish. ",6129,6177
76,"Next day, he went out after breakfast, and she sent the prince to the castle where the eldest sister was. ",6177,6283
77,The same thing happened there; ,6283,6314
78," but when the giant was snoring, the princess wakened up the prince, and they saddled two steeds in the stables and rode into the field on them. ",6313,6458
79,"But the horses' heels struck the stones outside the gate, and up got the giant and strode after them. ",6458,6560
80,"He roared and he shouted, and the more he shouted, the faster ran the horses, and just as the day was breaking he was only twenty perches behind. ",6560,6706
81,But the prince didn't leave the castle of Seven Inches without being provided with something good. ,6706,6805
82,"He reined in his steed, and flung a short, sharp knife over his shoulder, and up sprung a thick wood between the giant and themselves. ",6805,6940
83,"They caught the wind that blew before them, and the wind that blew behind them did not catch them. ",6940,7039
84,At last they were near the castle where the other sister lived; ,7039,7103
85," and there she was, waiting for them under a high hedge, and a fine steed under her. ",7102,7187
86,"But the giant was now in sight, roaring like a hundred lions, and the other giant was out in a moment, and the chase kept on. ",7187,7313
87,"For every two springs the horses gave, the giants gave three, and at last they were only seventy perches off. ",7313,7423
88,"Then the prince stopped again, and flung the second knife behind him. ",7423,7493
89,"Down went all the flat field, till there was a quarry between them a quarter of a mile deep, and the bottom filled with black water; ",7493,7626
90," and before the giants could get round it, the prince and princesses were inside the kingdom of the great magician, where the high thorny hedge opened of itself to everyone that he chose to let in. ",7625,7823
91,"There was joy enough between the three sisters, till the two eldest saw their lovers turned into stone. ",7823,7927
92,"But while they were shedding tears for them, Seven Inches came in, and touched them with his rod. ",7927,8025
93,"So they were flesh, and blood, and life once more, and there was great hugging and kissing, and all sat down to breakfast, and Seven Inches sat at the head of the table. ",8025,8195
94,"When breakfast was over, he took them into another room, where there was nothing but heaps of gold, and silver, and diamonds, and silks, and satins; ",8195,8344
95," and on a table there was lying three sets of crowns: a gold crown was in a silver crown, and that was lying in a copper crown. ",8343,8471
96,"He took up one set of crowns, and gave it to the eldest princess; ",8471,8537
97," and another set, and gave it to the second youngest princess; ",8536,8599
98," and another, and gave it to the youngest of all; ",8598,8648
99," and says he, 'Now you may all go to the bottom of the pit, and you have nothing to do but stir the basket, and the people that are watching above will draw you up. ",8647,8812
100,"But remember, ladies, you are to keep your crows safe, and be married in them, all the same day. ",8812,8909
101,"If you be married separately, or if you be married without your crowns, a curse will follow--mind what I say.' ",8909,9020
102,"So they took leave of him with great respect, and walked arm-in-arm to the bottom of the draw-well. ",9020,9120
103,"There was a sky and a sun over them, and a great high wall, covered with ivy, rose before them, and was so high they could not see to the top of it; ",9120,9269
104," and there was an arch in this wall, and the bottom of the draw-well was inside the arch. ",9268,9358
105,The youngest pair went last; ,9358,9387
106," and says the princess to the prince, 'I'm sure the two princes don't mean any good to you. ",9386,9478
107,"Keep these crowns under your cloak, and if you are obliged to stay last, don't get into the basket, but put a big stone, or any heavy thing inside, and see what will happen.' ",9478,9653
108,"As soon as they were inside the dark cave, they put in the eldest princess first, and stirred the basket, and up she went. ",9653,9776
109,"Then the basket was let down again, and up went the second princess, and then up went the youngest; ",9776,9876
110," but first she put her arms round her prince's neck, and kissed him, and cried a little. ",9875,9964
111,"At last it came to the turn of the youngest prince, and instead of going into the basket he put in a big stone. ",9964,10076
112,"He drew on one side and listened, and after the basket was drawn up about twenty perches, down came it and the stone like thunder, and the stone was broken into little bits. ",10076,10250
113,"Well, the poor prince had nothing for it but to walk back to the castle; ",10250,10323
114," and through it and round it he walked, and the finest of eating and drinking he got, and a bed of bog-down to sleep on, and long walks he took through gardens and lawns, but not a sight could he get, high or low, of Seven Inches. ",10322,10553
115,"He, before a week, got tired of it, he was so lonesome for his true love; ",10553,10627
116, and at the end of a month he didn't know what to do with himself. ,10626,10693
117,"One morning he went into the treasure room, and took notice of a beautiful snuff-box on the table that he didn't remember seeing there before. ",10693,10836
118,"He took it in his hands and opened it, and out Seven Inches walked on the table. ",10836,10917
119,"'I think, prince,' says he, 'you're getting a little tired of my castle?' ",10917,10991
120,'Ah!' ,10991,10997
121,"says the other, 'if I had my princess here, and could see you now and then, I'd never know a dismal day.' ",10997,11103
122,"'Well, you're long enough here now, and you're wanted there above. ",11103,11170
123,"Keep your bride's crowns safe, and whenever you want my help, open this snuff-box. ",11170,11253
124,"Now take a walk down the garden, and come back when you're tired.' ",11253,11320
125,"The prince was going down a gravel walk with a quickset hedge on each side, and his eyes on the ground, and he was thinking of one thing and another. ",11320,11470
126,"At last he lifted his eyes, and there he was outside of a smith's gate that he often passed before, about a mile away from the palace of his betrothed princess. ",11470,11631
127,"The clothes he had on him were as ragged as you please, but he had his crowns safe under his old cloak. ",11631,11735
128,"Then the smith came out, and says he, 'It's a shame for a strong, big fellow like you to be lazy, and so much work to be done. ",11735,11862
129,Are you any good with hammer and tongs? ,11862,11902
130,"Come in and bear a hand, an I'll give you diet and lodging, and a few pence when you earn them.' ",11902,11999
131,"'Never say't twice,' says the prince. ",11999,12037
132,'I want nothing but to be busy.' ,12037,12070
133,"So he took the hammer, and pounded away at the red-hot bar that the smith was turning on the anvil to make into a set of horse-shoes. ",12070,12204
134,"They hadn't been long at work when a tailor came in, and he sat down and began to talk. ",12204,12292
135,You all heard how the two princess were loth to be married till the youngest would be ready with her crowns and her sweetheart. ,12292,12420
136,"But after the windlass loosened accidentally when they were pulling up her bridegroom that was to be, there was no more sign of a well, or a rope, or a windlass, than there is on the palm of your hand. ",12420,12622
137,"So the princes that were courting the eldest ladies wouldn't give peace or ease to their lovers nor the king till they got consent to the marriage, and it was to take place this morning. ",12622,12809
138,"Myself went down out of curiousity, and to be sure I was delighted with the grand dresses of the two brides, and the three crowns on their heads--gold, silver, and copper, one inside the other. ",12809,13003
139,"The youngest was standing by mournful enough, and all was ready. ",13003,13068
140,"The two bridegrooms came in as proud and grand as you please, and up they were walking to the altar rails, when the boards opened two yards wide under their feet, and down they went among the dead men and the coffins in the vaults. ",13068,13300
141,"Oh, such shrieks as the ladies gave! ",13300,13337
142,and such running and racing and peeping down as there was! ,13337,13396
143,"but the clerk soon opened the door of the vault, and up came the two princes, their fine clothes covered an inch thick with cobwebs and mould. ",13396,13539
144,So the king said they should put off the marriage. ,13539,13590
145,"'For,' says he, 'I see there is no use in thinking of it till the youngest gets her three crowns, and is married with the others. ",13590,13720
146,I'll give my youngest daughter for a wife to whoever brings three crowns to me like the others; ,13720,13816
147," and if he doesn't care to be married, some other one will, and I'll make his fortune.' ",13815,13903
148,"'I wish,' says the smith, 'I could do it; ",13903,13945
149," but I was looking at the crowns after the princesses got home, and I don't think there's a black or a white smith on the face of the earth that could imitate them.' ",13944,14110
150,"'Faint heart never won fair lady,' says the prince. ",14110,14162
151,"'Go to the palace and ask for a quarter of a pound of gold, a quarter of a pound of silver, and a quarter of a pound of copper. ",14162,14290
152,"Get one crown for a pattern, and my head for a pledge, I'll give you out the very things that are wanted in the morning.' ",14290,14412
153,'Are you in earnest?' ,14412,14434
154,says the smith. ,14434,14450
155,"'Faith, I am so,' says he. ",14450,14477
156,'Go! ,14477,14482
157,you can't do worse than lose.' ,14482,14513
158,"To make a long story short, the smith got the quarter of a pound of gold, and the quarter of a pound of silver, and the quarter of a pound of copper, and gave them and the pattern crown to the prince. ",14513,14714
159,"He shut the forge door at nightfall, and the neighbours all gathered in the yard, and they heard him hammering, hammering, hammering, from that to daybreak; ",14714,14871
160," and every now and then he'd throw out through the window bits of gold, silver, and copper; ",14870,14962
161," and the idlers scrambled for them, and cursed one another, and prayed for the good luck of the workman. ",14961,15066
162,"Well, just as the sun was thinking to rise, he opened the door, and brought out the three crowns he got from his true love, and such shouting and huzzaing as there was! ",15066,15235
163,"The smith asked him to go along with him to the palace, but he refused; ",15235,15307
164," so off set the smith, and the whole townland with him; ",15306,15362
165, and wasn't the king rejoiced when he saw the crowns! ,15361,15415
166,"'Well,' says he to the smith, 'you're a married man. ",15415,15468
167,What's to be done?' ,15468,15488
168,"'Faith, your majesty, I didn't make them crowns at all. ",15488,15544
169,It was a big fellow that took service with me yesterday.' ,15544,15602
170,"'Well, daughter, will you marry the fellow that made these crowns?' ",15602,15670
171,"'Let me see them first, father,' said she; ",15670,15713
172," but when she examined them she knew them right well, and guessed it was her true love that sent them. ",15712,15815
173,"'I will marry the man that these crowns came from,' says she. ",15815,15877
174,"'Well,' says the king to the elder of the two princes, 'go up to the smith's forge, take my best coaches, and bring home the bridegroom.' ",15877,16015
175,"He did not like doing this, he was so proud, but he could not refuse. ",16015,16085
176,"When he came to the forge he saw the prince standing at the door, and beckoned him over to the coach. ",16085,16187
177,"'Are you the fellow,' says he, 'that made these crowns?' ",16187,16244
178,"'Yes,' says the other. ",16244,16267
179,"'Then,' says he, 'maybe you'd give yourself a brushing, and get into that coach; ",16267,16348
180, the king wants to see you. ,16347,16375
181,I pity the princess.' ,16375,16397
182,"The young prince got into the carriage, and while they were on the way he opened the snuff-box, and out walked Seven Inches, and stood on his thigh. ",16397,16546
183,"'Well,' says he, 'what trouble is on you now?' ",16546,16593
184,"'Master,' says the other, 'please let me go back to my forge, and let this carriage be filled with paving stones.' ",16593,16708
185,No sooner said than done. ,16708,16734
186,"The prince was sitting in his forge, and the horses wondered what was after happening to the carriage. ",16734,16837
187,"When they came into the palace yard, the king himself opened the carriage door, for respect to his new son-in-law. ",16837,16952
188,"As soon as he turned the handle, a shower of small stones fell on his powdered wig and his silk coat, and down he fell under them. ",16952,17083
189,"There was great fright and some laughter, and the king, after he wiped the blood from his forehead, looked very cross at the eldest prince. ",17083,17223
190,"'My lord,' says he, 'I'm very sorry for this accident, but I'm not to blame. ",17223,17300
191,"I saw the young smith get into the carriage, and we never stopped a minute since.' ",17300,17383
192,'It's uncivil you were to him. ,17383,17414
193,"Go,' says he to the other prince, 'and bring the young smith here, and be polite.' ",17414,17497
194,"'Never fear,' says he. ",17497,17520
195,"But there's some people that couldn't be good-natured if they tried, and not a bit civiller was the new messenger than the old, and when the king opened the carriage door a second time, it's shower of mud that came down on him. ",17520,17748
196,"'There's no use,' says he, 'going on this way. ",17748,17795
197,The fox never got a better messenger than himself.' ,17795,17847
198,"So he changed his clothes, and washed himself, and out he set to the prince's forge and asked him to sit along with himself. ",17847,17972
199,"The prince begged to be allowed to sit in the other carriage, and when they were half-way he opened his snuff-box. ",17972,18087
200,"'Master,' says he, 'I'd wish to be dressed now according to my rank.' ",18087,18157
201,"'You shall be that,' says Seven Inches. ",18157,18197
202,'And now I'll bid you farewell. ,18197,18229
203,Continue as good and kind as you always were; ,18229,18275
204, love your wife; ,18274,18291
205, and that's all the advice I'll give you.' ,18290,18333
206,So Seven Inches vanished; ,18333,18359
207," and when the carriage door was opened in the yard, out walks the prince as fine as hands could make him, and the first thing he did was to run over to his bride and embrace her. ",18358,18537
