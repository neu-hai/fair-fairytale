1,This is just the kind of wind to blow life into one. ,87,140
2,"How that great red thing up there is staring at me!"" ",140,193
3,"He meant the sun, who was just setting. ",193,233

5,"I shall manage to keep the pieces."" ",261,297
6,"He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes. ",297,364
7,"His mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course, furnished with teeth. ",364,448
8,"He had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips. ",448,574
9,"The sun went down, and the full moon rose, large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue. ",574,668
10,"""There it comes again, from the other side,"" said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more. ",668,784
11,"""Ah, I have cured him of staring, though. ",784,826
12,"Now he may hang up there, and shine, that I may see myself. ",826,886
13,"If I only knew how to manage to move away from this place,--I should so like to move. ",886,972
14,"If I could, I would slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do. ",972,1051
15,But I don't understand how. ,1051,1079
16,"I don't even know how to run."" ",1079,1110
17,"""Away, away,"" barked the old yard-dog. ",1110,1149
18,"He was quite hoarse, and could not pronounce ""Bow wow"" properly. ",1149,1214
19,"He had once been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse ever since. ",1214,1302
20,"""The sun will make you run some day. ",1302,1339
21,"I saw him, last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him. ",1339,1422
22,"Away, away, they all have to go."" ",1422,1456
23,"""I don't understand you, comrade,"" said the Snow Man. ",1456,1510
24,"""Is that thing up yonder to teach me to run? ",1510,1555
25,"I saw it running itself a little while ago, and now it has come creeping up from the other side."" ",1555,1653
26,"""You know nothing at all,"" replied the yard-dog; ",1653,1702
27," ""but then, you've only lately been patched up. ",1701,1749
28,"What you see yonder is the moon, and the one before it was the sun. ",1749,1817
29,"It will come again to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well. ",1817,1913
30,I think the weather is going to change. ,1913,1953
31,I can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg. ,1953,2002
32,"I am sure there is going to be a change."" ",2002,2044
33,"""I don't understand him,"" said the Snow Man to himself. ",2044,2100
34,"""But I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable. ",2100,2173
35,"The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; ",2173,2250
36," I can feel that too."" ",2249,2272
37,"""Away, away,"" barked the yard-dog, and then he turned round three times, and crept into his kennel to sleep. ",2272,2381
38,There was really a change in the weather. ,2381,2423
39,"Towards morning, a thick fog covered the whole country round, and a keen wind arose, so that the cold seemed to freeze one's bones. ",2423,2555
40,"But when the sun rose, the sight was splendid. ",2555,2602
41,"Trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost, and looked like a forest of white coral. ",2602,2690
42,While on every twig glittered frozen dew-drops. ,2690,2738
43,"The many delicate forms concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage, were now clearly defined, and looked like glittering lace-work. ",2738,2868
44,From every twig glistened a white radiance. ,2868,2912
45,"The birch, waving in the wind, looked full of life, like trees in summer. ",2912,2986
46,Its appearance was wondrously beautiful. ,2986,3027
47,"And where the sun shone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if diamond dust had been strewn about. ",3027,3133
48,"While the snowy carpet of the earth appeared as if covered with diamonds, from which countless lights gleamed, whiter than even the snow itself. ",3133,3278
49,"""This is really beautiful,"" said a young girl, who had come into the garden with a young man. ",3278,3372
50,"They both stood still near the Snow Man, and contemplated the glittering scene. ",3372,3452
51,"""Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,"" she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled. ",3452,3537
52,"""And we can't have such a fellow as this in the summer time,"" replied the young man, pointing to the Snow Man; ",3537,3648
53," ""he is capital."" ",3647,3665
54,"The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend. ",3665,3764
55,"The snow creaked and crackled beneath her feet, as if she had been treading on starch. ",3764,3851
56,"""Who are these two?"" ",3851,3872
57,asked the Snow Man of the yard-dog. ,3872,3908
58,"""You have been here longer than I have. ",3908,3948
59,"Do you know them?"" ",3948,3967
60,"""Of course I know them,"" replied the yard-dog; ",3967,4014
61," ""she has stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat. ",4013,4087
62,"I never bite those two."" ",4087,4112
63,"""But what are they?"" ",4112,4133
64,asked the Snow Man. ,4133,4153
65,"""They are lovers,"" he replied; ",4153,4184
66," ""they will go and live in the same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone. ",4183,4264
67,"Away, away!"" ",4264,4277
68,"""Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?"" ",4277,4326
69,asked the Snow Man. ,4133,4153
70,"""Well, they belong to the same master,"" retorted the yard-dog. ",4346,4409
71,"""Certainly people who were only born yesterday know very little. ",4409,4474
72,I can see that in you. ,4474,4497
73,I have age and experience. ,4497,4524
74,"I know every one here in the house, and I know there was once a time when I did not lie out here in the cold, fastened to a chain. ",4524,4655
75,"Away, away!"" ",4264,4277
76,"""The cold is delightful,"" said the Snow Man; ",4668,4713
77," ""but do tell me tell me; ",4712,4738
78, only you must not clank your chain so. ,4737,4777
79,"It jars all through me when you do that."" ",4777,4819
80,"""Away, away!"" ",4819,4833
81,barked the yard-dog. ,4833,4854
82,"""I'll tell you; ",4854,4870
83, they said I was a pretty little fellow once. ,4869,4915
84,"Then I used to lie in a velvet-covered chair, up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's lap. ",4915,5018
85,"They used to kiss my nose, and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief, and I was called 'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.' ",5018,5141
86,"But after a while I grew too big for them, and they sent me away to the housekeeper's room. ",5141,5233
87,So I came to live on the lower story. ,5233,5271
88,"You can look into the room from where you stand, and see where I was master once. ",5271,5353
89,I was indeed master to the housekeeper. ,5353,5393
90,It was certainly a smaller room than those up stairs. ,5393,5447
91,"But I was more comfortable, for I was not being continually taken hold of and pulled about by the children as I had been. ",5447,5569
92,"I received quite as good food, or even better. ",5569,5616
93,"I had my own cushion, and there was a stove--it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year. ",5616,5725
94,"I used to go under the stove, and lie down quite beneath it. ",5725,5786
95,"Ah, I still dream of that stove. ",5786,5819
96,"Away, away!"" ",4264,4277
97,"""Does a stove look beautiful?"" ",5832,5863
98,"asked the Snow Man, ""is it at all like me?"" ",5863,5907
99,"""It is just the reverse of you,"" said the dog; ",5907,5954
100," ""it's as black as a crow, and has a long neck and a brass knob. ",5953,6018
101,"It eats firewood, so that fire spurts out of its mouth. ",6018,6074
102,"We should keep on one side, or under it, to be comfortable. ",6074,6134
103,"You can see it through the window, from where you stand."" ",6134,6192
104,"Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it. ",6192,6315
105,The Snow Man felt quite a strange sensation come over him. ,6315,6374
106,"It was very odd, he knew not what it meant, and he could not account for it. ",6374,6451
107,"But there are people who are not men of snow, who understand what it is. ",6451,6524
108,"""And why did you leave her?"" ",6524,6553
109,"asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex. ",6553,6636
110,"""How could you give up such a comfortable place?"" ",6636,6686
111,"""I was obliged,"" replied the yard-dog. ",6686,6725
112,"""They turned me out of doors, and chained me up here. ",6725,6779
113,"I had bitten the youngest of my master's sons in the leg, because he kicked away the bone I was gnawing. ",6779,6884
114,"'Bone for bone,' I thought. ",6884,6912
115,"But they were so angry, and from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone. ",6912,7008
116,Don't you hear how hoarse I am. ,7008,7040
117,"Away, away!""",4264,4276
118,I can't talk any more like other dogs. ,7052,7091
119,"Away, away, that is the end of it all."" ",7091,7131
120,But the Snow Man was no longer listening. ,7131,7173
121,He was looking into the housekeeper's room on the lower storey. ,7173,7237
122,"Where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself. ",7237,7335
123,"""What a strange crackling I feel within me,"" he said. ",7335,7389
124,"""Shall I ever get in there? ",7389,7417
125,"It is an innocent wish, and innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled. ",7417,7487
126,"I must go in there and lean against her, even if I have to break the window."" ",7487,7565
127,"""You must never go in there,"" said the yard-dog, ""for if you approach the stove, you'll melt away, away."" ",7565,7671
128,"""I might as well go,"" said the Snow Man, ""for I think I am breaking up as it is."" ",7671,7753
129,"During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon. ",7753,7955
130,"No, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed. ",7955,8034
131,"When the door of the stove was opened, the flames darted out of its mouth. ",8034,8109
132,This is customary with all stoves. ,8109,8144
133,The light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast of the Snow Man with a ruddy gleam. ,8144,8241
134,"""I can endure it no longer,"" said he; ",8241,8279
135," ""how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?"" ",8278,8338
136,"The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with the cold. ",8338,8472
137,"In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were covered with ice. ",8472,8554
138,"They were the most beautiful ice-flowers any Snow Man could desire, but they concealed the stove. ",8554,8652
139,"These window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being. ",8652,8796
140,The snow crackled and the wind whistled around him. ,8796,8848
141,It was just the kind of frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly enjoy. ,8848,8922
142,But he did not enjoy it. ,8922,8947
143,"How, indeed, could he enjoy anything when he was ""stove sick?"" ",8947,9010
144,"""That is terrible disease for a Snow Man,"" said the yard-dog; ",9010,9072
145," ""I have suffered from it myself, but I got over it. ",9071,9124
146,"Away, away,"" he barked and then he added, ""the weather is going to change."" ",9124,9200
147,And the weather did change. ,9200,9228
148,It began to thaw. ,9228,9246
149,"As the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased. ",9246,9295
150,"He said nothing and made no complaint, which is a sure sign. ",9295,9356
151,"One morning he broke, and sunk down altogether. ",9356,9404
152,"Behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground. ",9404,9496
153,It was the pole round which the boys had built him up. ,9496,9551
154,"""Ah, now I understand why he had such a great longing for the stove,"" said the yard-dog. ",9551,9640
155,"""Why, there's the shovel that is used for cleaning out the stove, fastened to the pole."" ",9640,9729
156,The Snow Man had a stove scraper in his body. ,9729,9775
157,That was what moved him so. ,9775,9803
158,"""But it's all over now. ",9803,9827
159,"Away, away."" ",9827,9840
160,And soon the winter passed. ,9840,9868
161,"""Away, away,"" barked the hoarse yard-dog. ",9868,9910
162,"But the girls in the house sang, ""Come from your fragrant home, green thyme; ",9910,9987
163," Stretch your soft branches, willow-tree; ",9986,10028
164," The months are bringing the sweet spring-time, When the lark in the sky sings joyfully. ",10027,10116
165,"Come gentle sun, while the cuckoo sings, And I'll mock his note in my wanderings."" ",10116,10199
166,And nobody thought any more of the Snow Man.,10199,10244
