0,Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons. ,0,53
1,"When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country, and for many years no one heard anything about him. ",53,176
2,"Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father, who died at last in a good old age, leaving great riches behind him. ",176,303
3,"For some time the son who stayed at home spent his father's wealth freely, believing that he alone remained to enjoy it. ",303,424
4,"But, one day, as he was coming down stairs, he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall, looking about as if the house belonged to him. ",424,566
5,'Have you forgotten me?' ,566,591
6,asked the man. ,591,606
7,"'I can't forget a person I have never known,' was the rude answer. ",606,673
8,"'I am your brother,' replied the stranger, 'and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made. ",673,782
9,"And, what is worse, they tell me in the village that my father is dead. ",782,854
10,I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more.' ,854,936
11,"'He died six months ago,' said the rich brother, 'and he left you, as your portion, the old wooden chest that stands in the loft. ",936,1066
12,You had better go there and look for it; ,1066,1107
13, I have no more time to waste.' ,1106,1138
14,And he went his way. ,1138,1159
15,"So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft, which was at the top of the storehouse, and there he found the wooden chest, so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces. ",1159,1338
16,'What use is this old thing to me?' ,1338,1374
17,he said to himself. ,1374,1394
18,"'Oh, well, it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself; ",1394,1463
19, so things might be worse after all.' ,1462,1500
20,"Placing the chest on his back, the man, whose name was Jose, set out for his inn, and, borrowing a hatchet, began to chop up the box. ",1500,1634
21,"In doing so he discovered a secret drawer, and in it lay a paper. ",1634,1700
22,"He opened the paper, not knowing what it might contain, and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father. ",1700,1860
23,"Putting the precious writing in his pocket, he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside, and he ran out at once in search of him. ",1860,2040
24,"The debtor proved to be an old miser, who lived at the other end of the village. ",2040,2121
25,"He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed, and, indeed, when he saw it, was very unwilling to pay what he owed. ",2121,2277
26,"However, the stranger threatened to drag him before the king, and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one. ",2277,2429
27,"The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket, and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man. ",2429,2546
28,"A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town, when he met a poor woman crying bitterly. ",2546,2667
29,"He stopped and asked her what was the matter, and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying, and, to make matters worse, a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison. ",2667,2877
30,"'Comfort yourself,' said the stranger kindly; ",2877,2923
31, 'they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods. ,2922,2992
32,"I will not only pay his debts but, if he dies, the cost of his burial also. ",2992,3068
33,"And now go home, and nurse him as well as you can.' ",3068,3120
34,And so she did; ,3120,3136
35," but, in spite of her care, the husband died, and was buried by the stranger. ",3135,3213
36,"But everything cost more than he expected, and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left. ",3213,3326
37,'What am I to do now?' ,3326,3349
38,said he to himself. ,3349,3369
39,"'I think I had better go to court, and enter into the service of the king.' ",3369,3445
40,"At first he was only a servant, who carried the king the water for his bath, and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion. ",3445,3577
41,"But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him, and in a short time he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber. ",3577,3713
42,"Now, when this happened the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited, and did not know how to make any for himself. ",3713,3845
43,"He then bethought him of the king's favourite, and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother, whom he had so ill-used, would give him his protection, and find him a place. ",3845,4026
44,"The elder, who was always ready to help everyone spoke to the king on his behalf, and the next day the young man took up is work at court. ",4026,4165
45,"Unfortunately, the new-comer was by nature spiteful and envious, and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself. ",4165,4290
46,"By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors, he learned that the king, old and ugly though he was, had fallen in love with the Princess Bella-Flor, who would have nothing to say to him, and had hidden herself in some mountain castle, no one knew where. ",4290,4557
47,"'That will do nicely,' thought the scoundrel, rubbing his hands. ",4557,4622
48,"'It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her, and if he returns without finding her, his head will be the forfeit. ",4622,4767
49,"Either way, he will be out of MY path.' ",4767,4807
50,"So he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king, to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance. ",4807,4966
51,"The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay, and bade him state what he had to say, and to be quick about it. ",4966,5094
52,"'Oh, sire! ",5094,5105
53,"the Princess Bella-Flor-' answered the man, and then stopped as if afraid. ",5105,5180
54,'What of the Princess Bella-Flor?' ,5180,5215
55,asked the king impatiently. ,5215,5243
56,'I have heard-it is whispered at court-that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding.' ,5243,5343
57,"'I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me,' cried the king, eagerly. ",5343,5436
58,"'Speak on, knave; ",5436,5454
59, has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret?' ,5453,5505
60,"'It is not I, but my brother, who knows,' replied the traitor; ",5505,5568
61, 'if your majesty would ask him-' But before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall. ,5567,5729
62,"'Order Jose to appear before me instantly,' he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders, so great was the noise his majesty had made; ",5729,5872
63," and when Jose entered the hall, wondering what in the world could be the matter, the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement. ",5871,6004
64,"'Bring me the Princess Bella-Flor this moment,' stammered he, 'for if you return without her I will have you drowned!' ",6004,6123
65,"And without another word he left the hall, leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror. ",6123,6213
66,'How can I find the Princess Bella-Flor when I have never even seen her?' ,6213,6287
67,thought he. ,6287,6299
68,"'But it is no use staying here, for I shall only be put to death.' ",6299,6366
69,And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse. ,6366,6429
70,"There were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls, and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other, wondering which he should choose, when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach. ",6429,6684
71,"'Take me,' it said in a gentle whisper, 'and all will go well.' ",6684,6748
72,Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk. ,6748,6880
73,Mechanically he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable. ,6880,6967
74,"He was about to mount on his back, when the animal spoke again: 'Pick up those three loaves of bread which you see there, and put them in your pocket.' ",6967,7119
75,"Jose did as he was told, and being in a great hurry to get away, asked no questions, but swung himself into the saddle. ",7119,7239
76,"They rode far without meeting any adventures, but at length they came to an ant-hill, and the horse stopped. ",7239,7348
77,"'Crumble those three loaves for the ants,' he said. ",7348,7400
78,But Jose hesitated. ,7400,7420
79,"'Why, we may want them ourselves!' ",7420,7455
80,answered he. ,7455,7468
81,'Never mind that; ,7468,7486
82, give them to the ants all the same. ,7485,7522
83,Do not lose a chance of helping others.' ,7522,7563
84,"And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road, the horse galloped on. ",7563,7633
85,"By-and-by they entered a rocky pass between two mountains, and here they saw an eagle which had been caught in a hunter's net. ",7633,7760
86,"'Get down and cut the meshes of the net, and set the poor bird free,' said the horse. ",7760,7846
87,"'But it will take so long,' objected Jose, 'and we may miss the princess.' ",7846,7921
88,'Never mind that; ,7468,7486
89," do not lose a chance of helping others,' answered the horse. ",7938,8000
90,"And when the meshes were cut, and the eagle was free, the horse galloped on. ",8000,8077
91,"The had ridden many miles, and at last they came to a river, where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand, and the horse said: 'Do you see that little fish? ",8077,8247
92,It will die if you do not put it back in the water.' ,8247,8300
93,"'But, really, we shall never find the Princess Bella-Flor if we waste our time like this!' ",8300,8391
94,cried Jose. ,8391,8403
95,"'We never waste time when we are helping others,' answered the horse. ",8403,8473
96,And soon the little fish was swimming happily away. ,8473,8525
97,"A little while after they reached a castle, which was built in the middle of a very thick wood, and right in front was the Princess Bella-Flor feeding her hens. ",8525,8686
98,"'Now listen,' said the horse. ",8686,8716
99,"'I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips, which will amuse the Princess Bella-Flor. ",8716,8814
100,"Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way, and you must help her to mount. ",8814,8911
101,"When she is seated I shall begin to neigh and kick, and you must say that I have never carried a woman before, and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me. ",8911,9091
102,Once on my back we will go like the wind to the king's palace.' ,9091,9155
103,"Jose did exactly as the horse told him, and everything fell out as the animal prophesied; ",9155,9245
104, so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive. ,9244,9373
105,"She said nothing, however, but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens, and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground. ",9373,9520
106,"'Oh, I have let fall my bran!' ",9520,9551
107,cried she; ,9551,9562
108, 'please get down and pick it up for me.' ,9561,9603
109,But Jose only answered: 'We shall find plenty of bran where we are going.' ,9603,9678
110,And the horse galloped on. ,9678,9705
111,"They were now passing through a forest, and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards, so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree. ",9705,9869
112,'Dear me; ,9869,9879
113, how stupid! ,9878,9891
114,"I have let my handkerchief blow away,' said she. ",9891,9940
115,'Will you climb up and get it for me?' ,9940,9979
116,But Jose answered: 'We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going.' ,9979,10058
117,And the horse galloped on. ,9678,9705
118,"After the wood they reached a river, and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water. ",10085,10201
119,"'How careless of me,' gasped she, beginning to sob. ",10201,10253
120,'I have lost my favourite ring; ,10253,10285
121, DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it.' ,10284,10335
122,But Jose answered: 'You will find plenty of rings where you are going.' ,10335,10407
123,And the horse galloped on. ,9678,9705
124,"At last they entered the palace gates, and the king's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor. ",10434,10557
125,"But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly, and locked herself into the nearest room, which she would not open for all his entreaties. ",10557,10708
126,"'Bring me the three things I lost on the way, and perhaps I may think about it,' was all she would say. ",10708,10812
127,"And, in despair, the king was driven to take counsel of Jose. ",10812,10874
128,"'There is no remedy that I can see,' said his majesty, 'but that you, who know where they are, should go and bring them back. ",10874,11000
129,And if you return without them I will have you drowned.' ,11000,11057
130,Poor Jose was much troubled at these words. ,11057,11101
131,"He thought that he had done all that was required of him, and that his life was safe. ",11101,11187
132,"However, he bowed low, and went out to consult his friend the horse. ",11187,11256
133,"'Do not vex yourself,' said the horse, when he had heard the story; ",11256,11324
134," 'jump up, and we will go and look for the things.' ",11323,11375
135,And Jose mounted at once. ,11375,11401
136,"They rode on till they came to the ant-hill, and then the horse asked: 'Would you like to have the bran?' ",11401,11507
137,'What is the use of liking?' ,11507,11536
138,answered Jose. ,11536,11551
139,"'Well, call the ants, and tell them to fetch it for you; ",11551,11608
140," and, if some of it has been scattered by the wind, to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them.' ",11607,11731
141,Jose listened in surprise. ,11731,11758
142,He did not much believe in the horse's plan; ,11758,11803
143," but he could not think of anything better, so he called to the ants, and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could. ",11802,11926
144,"Then he saw under a tree and waited, while his horse cropped the green turf. ",11926,12003
145,'Look there!' ,12003,12017
146,"said the animal, suddenly raising its head; ",12017,12061
147," and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran, which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle. ",12060,12178
148,"'Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later,' observed the horse; ",12178,12239
149," 'but mount again, as we have far to go.' ",12238,12280
150,"When they arrived at the tree, they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch, and Jose's spirits sank again. ",12280,12416
151,'How am I to get that handkerchief?' ,12416,12453
152,cried he; ,12453,12463
153, 'why I should need Jacob's ladder!' ,12462,12499
154,But the horse answered: 'Do not be frightened; ,12499,12546
155," call to the eagle you set free from the net, he will bring it to you.' ",12545,12617
156,"So Jose called to the eagle, and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak. ",12617,12735
157,"Jose thanked him, and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river. ",12735,12806
158,"A great deal of rain had fallen in the night, and the river, instead of being clear as it was before, was dark and troubled. ",12806,12931
159,"'How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped, and cannot even see it?' ",12931,13063
160,asked Jose. ,13063,13075
161,But the horse answered: 'Do not be frightened; ,12499,12546
162," call the little fish whose life you saved, and she will bring it to you.' ",13121,13196
163,"So he called to the fish, and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones, and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring, and brought it to Jose in its mouth. ",13196,13383
164,"Well pleased with all he had done, Jose returned to the palace; ",13383,13447
165," but when the king took the precious objects to Bella-Flor, she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil. ",13446,13617
166,"'I am very sorry,' said the king to Jose, 'I really would rather not; ",13617,13687
167, but you see I have no choice.' ,13686,13718
168,"While the oil was being heated in the great caldron, Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape. ",13718,13870
169,"'Do not be frightened,' said the horse. ",13870,13910
170,"'Get on my back, and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration, then rub it all over your skin, and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it.' ",13910,14084
171,"Jose did not ask any more questions, but did as the horse bade him; ",14084,14152
172, and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil. ,14151,14243
173,He was left there till Bella-Flor cried that he must be cooked enough. ,14243,14314
174,"Then out came a youth so young and handsome, that everyone fell in love with him, and Bella-Flor most of all. ",14314,14424
175,"As for the old king, he saw that he had lost the game; ",14424,14479
176," and in despair he flung himself into the caldron, and was fried instead of Jose. ",14478,14560
177,"Then Jose was proclaimed king, on condition that he married Bella-Flor which he promised to do the next day. ",14560,14669
178,"But first he went to the stables and sought out the horse, and said to him: 'It is to you that I owe my life and my crown. ",14669,14792
179,Why have you done all this for me?' ,14792,14828
180,And the horse answered: 'I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune. ,14828,14924
181,"And when I saw you in danger of death I begged that I might help you, as you had helped me. ",14924,15016
182,"For, as I told you, Good deeds bear their own fruit!'",15016,15070
