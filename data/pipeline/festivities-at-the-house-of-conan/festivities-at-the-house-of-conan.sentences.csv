0,"""Win victory and blessings, O Fionn,"" said Conan, ""and tell me who was the man that, having only one leg, one arm, and one eye, escaped from you in consequence of his swiftness. ",0,178
1,"Who outstripped the Fenians of Eire, and why is this proverb used, 'As Roc came to the house of Fionn'?"" ",178,283
2,"""I will tell you that,"" said Fionn. ",283,319
3,"""One day the chief of the Fenians and I went to Teamhair Luachra. ",319,385
4,We took nothing in the chase that same day but one fawn. ,385,442
5,When it had been cooked it was fetched to me for the purpose of dividing it. ,442,519
6,"I gave a portion of it to each of the Fenian chiefs, and there remained none for my own share but a haunch bone. ",519,632
7,"Gobha Gaoithe, son of Ronan, presented himself, and requested me to give him the haunch. ",632,721
8,I accordingly gave it to him. ,721,751
9,He then declared that I gave him that portion on account of his swiftness of foot. ,751,834
10,"He went out on the plain, but he had only gone a short distance when Caoilte, son of Ronan, his own brother, overtook him, and brought the haunch back again to me, and we had no further dispute about the matter. ",834,1046
11,"We had not been long so when we saw a huge, obnoxious, massy-boned, black, detestable giant, having only one eye, one arm, and one leg, hop forward towards us. ",1046,1206
12,He saluted us. ,1206,1221
13,"I returned the salutation, and asked him whence he came."" ",1221,1279
14,"'I am come by the powers of the agility of my arm and leg,' responded he, 'having heard there is not one man in the world more liberal in bestowing gifts than you, O Fionn. ",1279,1452
15,"Therefore, I am come to solicit wealth and valuable gifts from you.' ",1452,1521
16,I replied that were all the wealth of the world mine I would give him neither little nor much. ,1521,1616
17,He then declared 'they were all liars who asserted that I never gave a refusal to any person.' ,1616,1711
18,I replied that if he were a man I would not give him a refusal. ,1711,1775
19,"'Well, then,' said the giant, 'let me have that haunch you have in your hand, and I will say good-bye to the Fenians, provided that you allow me the length of the haunch as a distance, and that I am not seized upon until I make my first hop.' ",1775,2018
20,"Upon hearing this I gave the haunch into the giant's hand, and he hopped over the lofty stockades of the town. ",2018,2129
21,He then made use of the utmost swiftness of his one leg to outstrip all the rest of the Fenians. ,2129,2226
22,"When the Fenian chiefs saw that, they started in pursuit of the giant, while I and the band of minstrels of the town went to the top of the dun to watch their proceedings. ",2226,2398
23,"When I saw that the giant had outstripped them a considerable distance, I put on my running habiliments, and, taking no weapon but Mac an Loin in my hand, I started after the others. ",2398,2581
24,"I overtook the hindmost division on Sliabh an Righ, the middle (next) division at Limerick, and the chiefs of the Fenians at Ath Bo, which is called Ath-Luain (Athlone), and those first in the pursuit at Rinn-an-Ruaigh, to the right-hand side of Cruachan of Connacht, where he (the giant) was distant less than a javelin's cast from me. ",2581,2918
25,"The giant passed on before me and crossed Eas Roe (now Ballyshannon), of the son of Modhuirn, without wetting his foot. ",2918,3038
26,I leaped over it after him. ,3038,3066
27,"He then directed his course towards the estuary of Binn-Edair, keeping the circuit of Eire to his right hand. ",3066,3176
28,"The giant leaped over the estuary, and it was a leap similar to flight over the sea. ",3176,3261
29,"I sprang after him, and having caught him by the small of the back, laid him prostrate on the earth. ",3261,3362
30,"'You have dealt unjustly by me, O Fionn,' cried the giant. ",3362,3421
31,"'For it was not with you I arranged the combat, but with the Fenians.' ",3421,3492
32,"I replied that the Fenians were not perfect, except I myself were with them. ",3492,3569
33,"We had not remained long thus when Liagan Luaimneach, from Luachar Deaghaidh, came to us. ",3569,3659
34,"He was followed by Caoilte Mac Ronan, together with the swiftest of the Fenians. ",3659,3740
35,"Each of them couched his javelin, intending to drive it through the giant and kill him in my arms, but I protected him from their attacks. ",3740,3879
36,Soon after this the main body of the Fenians arrived. ,3879,3933
37,They enquired what was the cause of the delay that the giant had not been slain. ,3933,4014
38,"'That is bad counsel,' said the giant, 'for a better man than I am would be slain in my eric.' ",4014,4109
39,We bound the giant strongly on that occasion. ,4109,4155
40,"Soon after Bran Beag O'Buadhchan came to invite me to a feast, and all the Fenians of Eire, who had been present, accompanied him to his house. ",4155,4299
41,"The banqueting hall had been prepared for our reception at that time, and the giant was dragged into the middle of the house, and was there placed in the sight of all present. ",4299,4475
42,They asked him who he was. ,4475,4502
43,"'Roc, son of Diocan, is my name,' replied he, 'that is, I am son to the Legislator of Aengus of the Brugh in the south. ",4502,4622
44,"My betrothed poured a current of surprising affection and a torrent of deep love upon Sgiath Breac, son of Dathcaoin yonder, who is your foster son, O Fionn. ",4622,4780
45,"It hurt my feelings severely to hear her boast of the swiftness and bravery of her lover in particular, and of the Fenians in general, and I declared that I would challenge him and all the Fenians of Eire to run a race with me. ",4780,5008
46,She sneered at me. ,5008,5027
47,"I then went to my beloved friend, Aengus of the Brugh, to bemoan my fate. ",5027,5101
48,"He metamorphosed me thus, and bestowed on me the swiftness of a druidical wind, as you have seen. ",5101,5199
49,"This is my history for you, and you ought to be well satisfied with all the hurt and injury you have inflicted upon me already.' ",5199,5328
50,"""Then I repented me of the indignity put upon the giant, and I released him from his bonds and I bade Liagan Luaimneach companion him to the presence of his betrothed one and testify to her on my behalf of his prowess in the race, wherein he had outstripped all the Fenians of Eire, save only myself. ",5328,5629
51,"So the two went forth together in friendly amity, and Roc, for the champion feat reported of him by Liagan Luaimneach, recovered the affection of his betrothed, and straightway took her to wife. ",5629,5824
52,"From that adventure, indeed, arose the proverb, 'As Roc came to the House of Fionn,' and so that is the answer to your question, O Conan,"" said Fionn. ",5824,5975
53,"""Win victory and blessings, O Fenian King,"" said Conan; ",5975,6031
54," ""it is with clear memory and sweet words you relate these things. ",6030,6097
55,"Tell me now the meaning of the byword, 'The hospitality of Fionn in the house of Cuanna.'"" ",6097,6188
56,"""I will tell you the truth concerning that, O Conan,"" said Fionn. ",6188,6254
57,"""Oisin, Caoilte, Mac Lughaidh, Diarmuid O'Duibhne, and myself happened one day, above all other days, to be on the summit of Cairn Feargall. ",6254,6395
58,"We were accompanied by our five hounds, namely, Bran, Sceoluing, Sear Dubh, Luath Luachar, and Anuaill. ",6395,6499
59,"We had not long been there when we perceived a rough, tall, huge giant approaching us. ",6499,6586
60,"He carried an iron fork upon his back, and a grunting hog was placed between the prongs of the fork; ",6586,6687
61, a young girl of mature age followed and forced the giant on his way before her. ,6686,6767
62,"'Let someone go forward and accost those people,' said I. Diarmuid O'Duibhne followed, but did not overtake them. ",6767,6881
63,"The other three and I started up, and followed Diarmuid and the giant. ",6881,6952
64,"We overtook Diarmuid, but did not come up with the giant or the girl; ",6952,7022
65," for a dark, gloomy, druidical mist showered down between us and them, so that we could not discern what road they took. ",7021,7142
66,"When the mist cleared away we looked around us, and discovered a light-roofed, comfortable-looking house at the edge of the ford near at hand. ",7142,7285
67,"We proceeded to the house, before which spread a lawn upon which were two fountains. ",7285,7370
68,"At the brink of one fountain lay a rude iron vessel, and a vessel of bronze at the brink of the other. ",7370,7473
69,"Those we met in the house were an aged, hoary-headed man standing by the door jamb to the right hand, and a beautiful maid sitting before him; ",7473,7616
70," a rough, rude, huge giant before the fire busily cooking a hog; ",7615,7680
71," and an old man at the other side of the fire, having an iron-grey head of hair and twelve eyes in his head, while the twelve sons (germs) of discord beamed in each eye."" ",7679,7850
72,"There was also in the house a ram with a white belly, a jet-black head, dark-green horns, and green feet; ",7850,7956
73, and there was in the end of the house a hag covered with a dark ash-coloured garment. ,7955,8042
74,There were no persons in the house except these. ,8042,8091
75,The man at the door-post welcomed us; ,8091,8129
76," and we five, having our five hounds with us, sat on the floor of the bruighean. ",8128,8209
77,"'Let submissive homage be done to Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his people,' said the man at the door-post. ",8209,8310
78,"'My case is that of a man begging a request, but obtaining neither the smaller nor the greater part of it,' said the giant. ",8310,8434
79,"Nevertheless, he rose up and did respectful homage to us. ",8434,8492
80,"After a while I became suddenly thirsty, and no person present perceived it but Caoilte, who began to complain bitterly on that account. ",8492,8629
81,"'You have no cause to complain, Caoilte,' said the man of the door-post, 'but only to step outside and fetch a drink for Fionn from whichever of the fountains you please.' ",8629,8801
82,"Caoilte did so, and fetched the bronze vessel brimful to me and gave me to drink. ",8801,8883
83,"I took a drink from it, and the water tasted like honey while I was drinking, but bitter as gall when I put the vessel from my lips; ",8883,9016
84, so that darting pains and symptoms of death seized me and agonising pangs from the poisonous draught. ,9015,9118
85,I could be but with difficulty recognised; ,9118,9161
86, and the lamentation of Caoilte on account of my being in that condition was greater than that he had before given vent to on account of my thirst. ,9160,9308
87,The man at the door-post desired Caoilte to go out and bring me a drink from the other fountain. ,9308,9405
88,"Caoilte obeyed, and brought me the iron vessel brimful. ",9405,9461
89,"I never underwent so much hardship in battle or conflict as I then suffered while drinking, in consequence of the bitterness of the draught; ",9461,9602
90," but as soon as I put the vessel from my lips I recovered my own colour and appearance, and that gave joy and happiness to my people. ",9601,9735
91,The man then asked if the hog which was in the boiler was yet cooked. ,9735,9805
92,"'It is cooked,' replied the giant, 'and allow me to divide it.' ",9805,9869
93,'How will you divide it?' ,9869,9895
94,said the man of the house. ,9895,9922
95,'I will give one hindquarter to Fionn and his hounds; ,9922,9976
96, the other hindquarter to Fionn's four men; ,9975,10019
97, the forepart to myself; ,10018,10043
98, the chine and rump to the old man who sits at the opposite side of the fire and to the hag in yonder corner; ,10042,10152
99, and the giblets to you and the young woman who is opposite to you.' ,10151,10220
100,"'I pledge my word,' said the man of the house, 'you have divided it very fairly.' ",10220,10302
101,"'I pledge my word,' exclaimed the ram, 'that the division is very unfair so far as I am concerned, for I have been altogether forgotten.' ",10302,10440
102,"And so saying, he immediately snatched the quarter that lay before my four men, and carried it away into a corner, where he began to devour it. ",10440,10584
103,"The four men instantly attacked the ram all at once with their swords, but though they laid on violently, it did not affect him in the least, and the blows fell away as from a stone or rock, so that they were forced to resume their seats. ",10584,10823
104,"'Upon my veracity, he is doomed for evil who owns as companions such four fellows as you are, who tamely suffer one single sheep to carry away your food and devour it before your faces,' exclaimed the man with the twelve eyes; ",10823,11050
105," and at the same time going up to the ram, he caught him by the feet and gave him a violent pitch out of the door, so that he fell on his back on the ground; ",11049,11207
106, and from that time we saw him no more. ,11206,11246
107,"Soon after this the hag started up, and having thrown her ashy-grey coverlet over my four men, metamorphosed them into four withered, drooping-headed old men. ",11246,11405
108,When I saw that I was seized with great fear and alarm; ,11405,11461
109," and when the man at the door-post perceived this, he desired me to come over to him, place my head on his bosom, and sleep. ",11460,11585
110,I did so; ,11585,11595
111, and the hag got up and took her coverlet off my four men; ,11594,11653
112," and when I awoke I found them restored to their own shape, and that was a great happiness to me. ",11652,11750
113,"'O Fionn,' asked the man of the door-post, 'do you feel surprised at the appearance and arrangements of this house?' ",11750,11867
114,I assured him that I never saw anything which surprised me more. ,11867,11932
115,"'Well, then, I will explain the meaning of all these things to you,' said the man. ",11932,12015
116,"'The giant carrying the grunting hog between the prongs of the iron fork, whom you first saw, is he who is yonder, and his name is SLOTH. ",12015,12153
117,"She who is close to me is the young woman who had been forcing him along, that is ENERGY; ",12153,12243
118, and ENERGY compels SLOTH forward with her; ,12242,12286
119," for ENERGY moves, in the twinkling of the eye, a greater distance than the foot can travel in a year. ",12285,12388
120,The old man of the bright eyes yonder signifies the WORLD; ,12388,12447
121," and he is more powerful than anyone, which has been proved by his rendering the ram powerless. ",12446,12542
122,That ram which you saw signifies the CRIMES of the man. ,12542,12598
123,"That hag there beyond is withering OLD AGE, and her clothing has withered your four men. ",12598,12687
124,The two wells from which you drank the two draughts mean FALSEHOOD and TRUTH; ,12687,12765
125," for while telling a lie one finds it sweet, but it becomes bitter at the last. ",12764,12844
126,Cuanna from Innistuil is my own name. ,12844,12882
127,"I do not reside here, but having conceived a wonderful love for you, O Fionn, on account of your superiority in wisdom and general celebrity, I therefore put those things into the way before you in order that I might see you. ",12882,13108
128,"And this story shall be called, to the end of the world, the Hospitality of Cuanna's House to Fionn. ",13108,13209
129,"Let you and your men come together, and do ye five sleep until morning.' ",13209,13282
130,"Accordingly we did so, and when we awoke in the morning we found ourselves on the summit of Cairn Feargaill, with our hounds and arms by us. ",13282,13423
131,"So there is the meaning of the byword, 'The hospitality of Fionn in the house of Cuanna,' O Conan, said Fionn.",13423,13534
