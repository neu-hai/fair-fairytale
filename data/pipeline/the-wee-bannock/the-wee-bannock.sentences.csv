0,"""Some tell about their sweethearts, How they tirled them to the winnock, But I'll tell you a bonnie tale About a guid oatmeal bannock."" ",0,136
1,"There was once an old man and his wife, who lived in a dear little cottage by the side of a burn. ",136,234
2,"They were a very canty and contented couple, for they had enough to live on, and enough to do. ",234,329
3,"Indeed, they considered themselves quite rich, for, besides their cottage and their garden, they possessed two sleek cows, five hens and a cock, an old cat, and two kittens. ",329,503
4,"The old man spent his time looking after the cows, and the hens, and the garden; ",503,584
5, while the old woman kept herself busy spinning. ,583,632
6,"One day, just after breakfast, the old woman thought that she would like an oatmeal bannock for her supper that evening, so she took down her bakeboard, and put on her girdle, and baked a couple of fine cakes, and when they were ready she put them down before the fire to harden. ",632,912
7,"While they were toasting, her husband came in from the byre, and sat down to take a rest in his great arm-chair. ",912,1025
8,"Presently his eyes fell on the bannocks, and, as they looked very good, he broke one through the middle and began to eat it. ",1025,1150
9,"When the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate, so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could. ",1150,1305
10,"And when the old woman saw it disappearing, she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her, holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other. ",1305,1465
11,"But she was old, and the bannock was young, and it ran faster than she did, and escaped over the hill behind the house. ",1465,1585
12,"It ran, and it ran, and it ran, until it came to a large newly thatched cottage, and, as the door was open, it took refuge inside, and ran right across the floor to a blazing fire, which was burning in the first room that it came to. ",1585,1819
13,"Now, it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor, and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross-legged on the top of a big table by the window, sewing away with all their might, while the tailor's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint. ",1819,2071
14,"When the wee bannock came trundling across the floor, all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the Master Tailor's wife. ",2071,2239
15,"""Hoot,"" she said, ""what a set of cowards ye be! ",2239,2287
16,It is but a nice wee bannock. ,2287,2317
17,"Get hold of it and divide it between you, and I'll fetch you all a drink of milk."" ",2317,2400
18,"So she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards, and the tailor jumped up with his great shears, and one apprentice grasped the line measure, while another took up the saucer full of pins; ",2400,2591
19, and they all tried to catch the wee bannock. ,2590,2636
20,"But it dodged them round and round the fire, and at last it got safely out of the door and ran down the road, with one of the apprentices after it, who tried to snip it in two with his shears. ",2636,2829
21,"It ran too quickly for him, however, and at last he stopped and went back to the house, while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside. ",2829,2995
22,"It trundled in at the door, and there was a weaver sitting at his loom, with his wife beside him, winding a clue of yarn. ",2995,3117
23,"""What's that, Tibby?"" ",3117,3139
24,"said the weaver, with a start as the little cake flew past him. ",3139,3203
25,"""Oh!"" ",3203,3209
26,"cried she in delight, jumping to her feet, ""It is a wee bannock. ",3209,3274
27,"I wonder where it came from?"" ",3274,3304
28,"""Dinna bother your head about that, Tibby,"" said her man, ""but grip it, my woman, grip it."" ",3304,3396
29,But it was not so easy to get hold of the wee bannock. ,3396,3451
30,"It was in vain that the Goodwife threw her clue at it, and that the Goodman tried to chase it into a corner and knock it down with his shuttle. ",3451,3595
31,"It dodged, and turned, and twisted, like a thing bewitched, till at last it flew out at the door again, and vanished down the hill, ""for all the world,"" as the old woman said, ""like a new tarred sheep, or a daft cow."" ",3595,3813
32,"In the next house that it came to it found the Goodwife in the kitchen, kirning. ",3813,3894
33,"She had just filled her kirn, and there was still some cream standing in the bottom of her cream jar. ",3894,3996
34,"""Come away, little bannock,"" she cried when she saw it. ",3996,4052
35,"""Thou art come in just the nick of time, for I am beginning to feel hungry, and I'll have cakes and cream for my dinner."" ",4052,4174
36,"But the wee bannock hopped round to the other side of the kirn, and the Goodwife after it. ",4174,4265
37,And she was in such a hurry that she nearly upset the kirn; ,4265,4325
38," and by the time that she had put it right again, the wee bannock was out at the door and half-way down the brae to the mill. ",4324,4450
39,"The miller was sifting meal in the trough, but he straightened himselfup when he saw the little cake. ",4450,4552
40,"""It's a sign of plenty when bannocks are running about with no one to look after them,"" he said; ",4552,4649
41," ""but I like bannocks and cheese, so just come in, and I will give thee a night's lodging."" ",4648,4740
42,"But the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller, so it turned and ran out of the mill, and the miller was so busy that he did not trouble himself to run after it. ",4740,4919
43,"After this it ran on, and on, and on, till it came to the smithy, and it popped in there to see what it could see. ",4919,5034
44,"The smith was busy at the anvil making horse-shoe nails, but he looked up as the wee bannock entered. ",5034,5136
45,"""If there be one thing I am fond of, it is a glass of ale and a well-toasted cake,"" he cried. ",5136,5230
46,"""So come inside here, and welcome to you."" ",5230,5273
47,"But as soon as the little bannock heard of the ale, it turned and ran out of the smithy as fast as it could, and the disappointed smith picked up his hammer and ran after it. ",5273,5448
48,"And when he saw that he could not catch it, he flung his heavy hammer at it, in the hope of knocking it down, but, luckily for the little cake, he missed his aim. ",5448,5611
49,"After this the bannock came to a farmhouse, with a great stack of peats standing at the back of it. ",5611,5711
50,"In it went, and ran to the fireside. ",5711,5748
51,"In this house the master had all the lint spread out on the floor, and was cloving it with an iron rod, while the mistress was heckling what he had already cloven. ",5748,5912
52,"""Oh, Janet,"" cried the Goodman in surprise, ""here comes in a little bannock. ",5912,5989
53,It looks rare and good to eat. ,5989,6020
54,"I'll have one half of it."" ",6020,6047
55,"""And I'll have the other half,"" cried the Goodwife. ",6047,6099
56,"""Hit it over the back with your cloving-stick, Sandy, and knock it down. ",6099,6172
57,"Quick, or it will be out at the door again."" ",6172,6217
58,"But the bannock played ""jook-about,"" and dodged behind a chair. ",6217,6281
59,"""Hoot!"" ",6281,6289
60,"cried Janet contemptuously, for she thought that her husband might easily have hit it, and she threw her heckle at it. ",6289,6408
61,"But the heckle missed it, just as her husband's cloving-rod had done, for it played ""jook-about"" again, and flew out of the house. ",6408,6539
62,This time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standing among the heather. ,6539,6631
63,"Here the Goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire, and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow. ",6631,6802
64,"""Oh, Jock! ",6802,6813
65,"come here, come here,"" cried the Goodwife. ",6813,6856
66,"""You are crying for a little bannock for your supper; ",6856,6910
67," come here, histie, quick, and help me to catch it."" ",6909,6962
68,"""Ay, ay,"" assented Jock, jumping to his feet and hurrying across the little room. ",6962,7044
69,"""But where is it? ",7044,7062
70,"I cannot see it."" ",7062,7080
71,"""There, man, there,"" cried his wife, ""under that chair. ",7080,7136
72,Run thou to that side; ,7136,7159
73," I will keep to this."" ",7158,7181
74,So Jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair; ,7181,7232
75," but, in his hurry, he tripped and fell, and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door. ",7231,7343
76,"Through the whins and up the hillside it ran, and over the top of the hill, to a shepherd's cottage on the other side. ",7343,7462
77,"The inmates were just sitting down to their porridge, and the Goodwife was scraping the pan. ",7462,7555
78,"""Save us and help us,"" she exclaimed, stopping with the spoon half-way to her mouth. ",7555,7640
79,"""There's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at our fireside."" ",7640,7704
80,"""Sneck the door,"" cried the husband, ""and we'll try to catch it. ",7704,7769
81,"It would come in handy after the porridge."" ",7769,7813
82,But the bannock did not wait until the door was sneckit. ,7813,7870
83,"It turned and ran as fast as it could, and the shepherd and his wife and all the bairns ran after it, with their spoons in their hands, in hopes of catching it. ",7870,8031
84,"And when the shepherd saw that it could run faster than they could, he threw his bonnet at it, and almost struck it; ",8031,8148
85," but it escaped all these dangers, and soon it came to another house, where the folk were just going to bed. ",8147,8256
86,"The Goodman was half undressed, and the Goodwife was raking the cinders carefully out of the fire. ",8256,8355
87,"""What's that?"" ",8355,8370
88,"said he, ""for the bowl of brose that I had at supper-time wasn't very big."" ",8370,8446
89,"""Catch it, then,"" answered his wife, ""and I'll have a bit, too. ",8446,8510
90,Quick! ,8510,8517
91,quick! ,8517,8524
92,"Throw your coat over it or it will be away."" ",8524,8569
93,"So the Goodman threw his coat right on the top of the little bannock,and almost managed to smother it; ",8569,8672
94," but it struggled bravely, and got out,breathless and hot, from under it. ",8671,8745
95,"Then it ran out into the grey light again, for night was beginning to fall, and the Goodman ran out after it, without his coat. ",8745,8873
96,"He chased it and chased it through the stackyard and across a field, and in amongst a fine patch of whins. ",8873,8980
97,Then he lost it; ,8980,8997
98," and, as he was feeling cold without his coat, he went home. ",8996,9057
99,"As for the poor little bannock, it thought that it would creep under a whin bush and lie there till morning, but it was so dark that it never saw that there was a fox's hole there. ",9057,9238
100,"So it fell down the fox's hole, and the fox was very glad to see it, for he had had no food for two days. ",9238,9344
101,"""Oh, welcome, welcome,"" he cried; ",9344,9378
102," and he snapped it through the middle with his teeth, and that was the end of the poor wee bannock. ",9377,9477
103,"And if a moral be wanted for this tale, here it is: That people should never be too uplifted or too cast down over anything, for all the good folk in the story thought that they were going to get the bannock, and, lo and behold! ",9477,9706
104,the fox got it after all.,9706,9732
