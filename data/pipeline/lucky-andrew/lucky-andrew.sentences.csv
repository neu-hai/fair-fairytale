0,"There was once a rich peasant who had two sons, named John Nicholas and Lucky Andrew. ",0,86
1,The oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can quite make head or tail. ,86,169
2,"He was a most unpleasant customer to deal with, and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland are, as a rule, though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with these attractive qualities. ",169,383
3,"The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high spirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might be, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star. ",383,567
4,"When the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face till the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a lucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet. ",567,771
5,"Did his boat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him hanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and asked him how he felt, he would reply: ""O, quite well. ",771,972
6,I have been saved. ,972,991
7,"I surely am in luck!"" ",991,1013
8,"When their father died, both of them were of age, and not long after they both had to go out to the sand-banks to fetch some fishing-nets, which had been left there since the summer fishing. ",1013,1204
9,"It was late in the fall, after the time when most fishermen are busy with the summer fishing. ",1204,1298
10,"Andrew had his gun along, which he carried with him wherever he went. ",1298,1368
11,John Nicholas did not say much while they were underway; ,1368,1425
12, but he thought all the harder. ,1424,1456
13,They were not ready to set out for home again until near evening. ,1456,1522
14,"""Hark, Lucky Andrew, do you know there will be a storm to-night?"" ",1522,1588
15,"said John Nicholas, and looked out across the sea. ",1588,1639
16,"""I think it would be best if we stayed here until morning!"" ",1639,1699
17,"""There'll be no storm,"" said Andrew. ",1699,1736
18,"""The Seven Sisters have not put on their fog-caps, so you may be quite at rest."" ",1736,1817
19,"But his brother complained of being weary, and at length they decided to remain there for the night. ",1817,1918
20,When Andrew awoke he found himself alone; ,1918,1960
21," and he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to the highest point of the island. ",1959,2047
22,"Then he discovered him far out, darting for land like a sea-gull. ",2047,2113
23,Andrew did not understand the whole affair. ,2113,2157
24,"There were still provisions there, as well as a dish of curd, his gun and various other things. ",2157,2253
25,So Andrew wasted but little time in thought. ,2253,2298
26,"""He will come back this evening,"" said he. ",2298,2341
27,"""Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat."" ",2341,2390
28,"But in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited day by day, and week by week; ",2390,2490
29," until at last, he realized that his brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to keep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it. ",2489,2659
30,"And such was the case, for when John Nicholas came in sight of land on his homeward trip, he had capsized the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew had been drowned. ",2659,2824
31,But the latter did not lose heart. ,2824,2859
32,"He gathered drift-wood along the strand, shot sea-birds, and looked for mussels and roots. ",2859,2950
33,"He built himself a raft of drift-timber, and fished with a pole that had also been left behind. ",2950,3046
34,"One day, while he was at work, he happened to notice a depression or hollow in the sand, as though made by the keel of a large Northland schooner, and he could plainly trace the braidings of the hawsers from the strand up to the top of the island. ",3046,3294
35,"Then he thought to himself that he was in no danger, for he saw there was truth in the report he had often heard, that the meer-folk made the island their abode, and did much business with their ships. ",3294,3496
36,"""God be praised for good company! ",3496,3530
37,That was just what I needed. ,3530,3559
38,"Yes, it is true, as I have always said, that I was born under a lucky star,"" thought Andrew to himself; ",3559,3663
39," perhaps he said so too, for occasionally he really had to talk a little. ",3662,3736
40,So he lived through the fall. ,3736,3766
41,"Once he saw a boat, and hung a rag on a pole and waved with it; ",3766,3830
42," but that very moment the sail dropped, and the crew took to the oars and rowed away at top speed, for they thought the meer-trolls were making signs and waving. ",3829,3991
43,On Christmas Eve Andrew heard fiddles and music far out at sea; ,3991,4055
44," and when he came out, he saw a glow of light that came from a great Northland schooner, which was gliding toward the land--yet such a ship he had never yet seen. ",4054,4217
45,"It has a main-sail of uncommon size, which looked to him to be of silk, and the most delicate tackling, as thin as though woven of steel wire, and everything else was in proportion, as fine and handsome as any Northlander might wish to have. ",4217,4459
46,"The whole schooner was filled with little people dressed in blue, but the girl who stood at the helm was adorned like a bride, and looked as splendid as a queen, for she wore a crown and costly garments. ",4459,4663
47,"Yet any one could see that she was a human being, for she was tall, and handsomer than the meer-folk. ",4663,4765
48,"In fact, Lucky Andrew thought that she was handsomer than any girl he ever had seen. ",4765,4850
49,The schooner headed for the land where Andrew stood; ,4850,4903
50," but with his usual presence of mind, he hurried to the fisherman's hut, pulled down his gun from the wall, and crept up into the large loft and hid himself, so that he could see all that passed in the hut. ",4902,5109
51,He soon noticed that the whole room was alive with people. ,5109,5168
52,"They filled it completely and more, and still more of them came in. ",5168,5236
53,"Then the walls began to crack, and the little hut spread out at all corners, and grew so splendid and magnificent that the wealthiest merchant could not have had its equal; ",5236,5409
54, it was almost like being in a royal castle. ,5408,5453
55,Tables were covered with the most exquisite silver and gold. ,5453,5514
56,When they had eaten they began to dance. ,5514,5555
57,"Under cover of the noise, Andrew crept to the look-out at the side of the roof, and climbed down. ",5555,5653
58,"Then he ran to the schooner, threw his flint-stone over it, and in order to make certain, cut a cross into it with his sharp-cutting knife. ",5653,5793
59,"When he came back again, the dance was in full swing. ",5793,5847
60,"The tables were dancing and the benches and chairs--everything else in the room was dancing, too. ",5847,5945
61,The only one who did not dance was the bride; ,5945,5991
62," she only sat there and looked on, and when the bridegroom came to fetch her, she sent him away. ",5990,6087
63,For the moment there was no thought of stopping. ,6087,6136
64,"The fiddler knew neither rest nor repose, and did not pass his cap, but played merrily on with his left hand, and beat time with his foot, until he was dripping with sweat, and the fiddle was hidden by the dust and smoke. ",6136,6358
65,"When Andrew noticed that his own feet began to twitch where he was standing, he thought to himself: ""Now I had better shoot away, or else he will play me right off the ground!"" ",6358,6535
66,"So he turned his gun, thrust it through the window, and shot it off over the bride's head; ",6535,6626
67," but upside down, otherwise the bullet would have hit him. ",6625,6684
68,"The moment the shot crashed, all the troll-folk tumbled out of the door together; ",6684,6766
69," but when they saw that the schooner was banned on the shore, they wailed and crept into a hole in the hill. ",6765,6874
70,"But all the gold and silver dishes were left behind, and the bride, too, was still sitting there. ",6874,6972
71,She told Lucky Andrew that she had been carried into the hill when she was only a small child. ,6972,7067
72,"Once, when her mother had gone to the pen to attend to the milking, she had taken her along; ",7067,7160
73," but when she had to go home for a moment, she left the child sitting under a juniper-bush, and told her that she might eat the berries if she only repeated three times: ""I eat juniper-berries blue, Wherein Jesu's cross I view. ",7159,7387
74,"I eat whortle-berries red, Since 'twas for my sake He bled!"" ",7387,7448
75,"But after her mother had gone, she found so many berries that she forgot to say her verse, and so she was enchanted and taken into the hill. ",7448,7589
76,"And there no harm had been done her, save that she had lost the top joint of the little finger of her left hand, and the goblins had been kind to her; ",7589,7740
77," yet it had always seemed to her as though something were not as it should be, she felt as though something weighed upon her, and she had suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for her husband. ",7739,7962
78,"When Andrew learned who her mother and her people were, he saw that they were related to him, and they became very good friends. ",7962,8091
79,So Andrew could truly say he had been born under a lucky star. ,8091,8154
80,"Then they sailed home, and took along the schooner, and all the gold and silver, and all the treasure which had been left in the hut, and then Andrew was far wealthier than his brother. ",8154,8340
81,"But the latter, who suspected where all this wealth had come from, did not wish to be any poorer than Andrew. ",8340,8450
82,"He knew that trolls and goblins walk mainly on Christmas Eve, and for that reason he sailed out to the sand banks at that time. ",8450,8578
83,"And on Christmas Eve he did see a light or fire, but it seemed to be like will-o'-the-wisps fluttering about. ",8578,8688
84,"When he came nearer he heard splashes, horrible howls, and cold, piercing cries, and there was a smell of slime and sea-weed, as at ebb-tide. ",8688,8830
85,"Terrified, he ran up into the hut, from whence he could see the trolls on the shore. ",8830,8915
86,"They were short and thick like hay-ricks, completely covered with fur, with kirtles of skins, fishing boots, and enormous fist-gloves. ",8915,9050
87,In place of head and hair they had bundles of sea-weed. ,9050,9106
88,"When they crawled up from the strand there was a gleam behind them like that of rotting wood, and when they shook themselves they showered sparks about them. ",9106,9264
89,"When they drew nearer, John Nicholas crawled up into the loft as his brother had done. ",9264,9351
90,"The goblins dragged a great stone into the hut, and began to beat their gloves dry against it, and meanwhile they screamed so that John Nicholas's blood turned to ice in his hiding-place. ",9351,9539
91,Then one of them sneezed into the ashes on the hearth in order to make the fire burn again; ,9539,9631
92," while the others carried in heather-grass and drift-wood, as coarse and heavy as lead. ",9630,9718
93,"The smoke and the heat nearly killed the eavesdropper in the loft, and in order to catch his breath and get some fresh air, he tried to crawl out of the look-out in the roof; ",9718,9893
94," yet he was of much heavier build than his brother, stuck fast and could move neither in nor out. ",9892,9990
95,Then he grew frightened and began to scream; ,9990,10035
96," but the goblins screamed much louder, and roared and howled, and thumped and clamored inside and outside the hut. ",10034,10149
97,"But when the cock crowed they disappeared, and John Nicholas freed himself, too. ",10149,10230
98,"Yet when he returned home from his trip, he had lost his reason, and after that the same cold, sinister screams which are the mark of the troll in the Northland, might often be heard sounding from store-rooms and lofts where he happened to be. ",10230,10474
99,"Before his death, however, his reason returned, and he was buried in consecrated ground, as they say. ",10474,10576
100,But after that time no human foot ever trod the sand-banks again. ,10576,10642
101,"They sank, and the meer-folk, it is believed, went to the Lekang Islands. ",10642,10716
102,Andrew's luck held good; ,10716,10741
103, no ship made more successful trips than his own; ,10740,10790
104," but whenever he came to the Lekang Islands he lay becalmed--the goblins went aboard or ashore with their goods--but after a time he had fair winds, whether he happened to want to go to Bergen, or sail home. ",10789,10997
105,"He had many children, and all of them were bright and vigorous, yet every one of them lacked the upper joint of the little finger of his left hand.",10997,11145
