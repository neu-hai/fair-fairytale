32,First some one must go to the river-god's castle. ,2293,2343
33,"Let him know that he may come himself and fetch his bride."" ",2343,2403
34,And with these words he looked at a witch. ,2403,2446
35,"He said: ""You may go!"" ",2446,2469
36,"The witch hesitated, but he ordered his servants to seize her and thrust her into the stream. ",2469,2563

46,"He said: ""Do you go and hunt them up!"" ",3077,3116
