0,WHAT a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen! ,0,65
1,"--Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs. ",65,190
2,"HER sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else--""I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; ",190,363
3," and no more have you, Jemima. ",362,393
4,You would let them go cold; ,393,421
5," you know you would!"" ",420,442
6,"""I wish to hatch my own eggs; ",442,472
7," I will hatch them all by myself,"" quacked Jemima Puddle-duck. ",471,534
8,SHE tried to hide her eggs; ,534,562
9, but they were always found and carried off. ,561,606
10,Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. ,606,649
11,She determined to make a nest right away from the farm. ,649,705
12,SHE set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill. ,705,790
13,She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet. ,790,833
14,"WHEN she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance. ",833,903
15,She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot. ,903,949
16,JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was not much in the habit of flying. ,949,1005
17,"She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air. ",1005,1092
18,SHE flew beautifully when she had got a good start. ,1092,1144
19,"She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared. ",1144,1284
20,"JEMIMA alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. ",1284,1387
21,She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves. ,1387,1449
22,"But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper. ",1449,1554
23,He had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers. ,1554,1607
24,"""Quack?"" ",1607,1616
25,"said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side--""Quack?"" ",1616,1692
26,"THE gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima-- ""Madam, have you lost your way?"" ",1692,1808
27,said he. ,1808,1817
28,"He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp. ",1817,1901
29,Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. ,1901,1947
30,"She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place. ",1947,2056
31,"""AH! ",2056,2061
32,is that so? ,2061,2073
33,"indeed!"" ",2073,2082
34,"said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima. ",2082,2151
35,"He folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket. ",2151,2215
36,Jemima complained of the superfluous hen. ,2215,2257
37,"""Indeed! ",2257,2266
38,how interesting! ,2266,2283
39,I wish I could meet with that fowl. ,2283,2319
40,"I would teach it to mind its own business!"" ",2319,2363
41,"""BUT as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. ",2363,2452
42,"No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. ",2452,2500
43,"You may sit there as long as you like,"" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman. ",2500,2578
44,"He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves. ",2578,2657
45,"It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney. ",2657,2768
46,"""THIS is my summer residence; ",2768,2798
47," you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient,"" said the hospitable gentleman. ",2797,2891
48,"There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. ",2891,2970
49,"The gentleman opened the door, and showed Jemima in. ",2970,3023
50,THE shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; ,3023,3094
51, but it was comfortable and very soft. ,3093,3132
52,Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. ,3132,3214
53,But it was very comfortable; ,3214,3243
54, and she made a nest without any trouble at all. ,3242,3291
55,"WHEN she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it. ",3291,3454
56,"He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night. ",3454,3537
57,He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day. ,3537,3616
58,He said he loved eggs and ducklings; ,3616,3653
59, he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed. ,3652,3712
60,JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK came every afternoon; ,3712,3753
61, she laid nine eggs in the nest. ,3752,3785
62,They were greeny white and very large. ,3785,3824
63,The foxy gentleman admired them immensely. ,3824,3867
64,He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there. ,3867,3935
65,"At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--""and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. ",3935,4107
66,"They might catch cold,"" said the conscientious Jemima. ",4107,4162
67,"""MADAM, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; ",4162,4216
68, I will provide oats. ,4215,4237
69,"But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat. ",4237,4313
70,"Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!"" ",4313,4359
71,"""May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? ",4359,4446
72,"Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. ",4446,4505
73,"I will provide lard for the stuff-lard for the omelette,"" said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers. ",4505,4614
74,JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious. ,4614,4711
75,"She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck. ",4711,4840
76,"AND she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket. ",4840,4910
77,"The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, ""What are you doing with those onions? ",4910,4988
78,"Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?"" ",4988,5054
79,Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; ,5054,5094
80, she told him the whole story. ,5093,5124
81,"The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; ",5124,5177
82, he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers. ,5176,5249
83,"HE asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed. ",5249,5344
84,"Then he went out, and trotted down the village. ",5344,5392
85,He went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher. ,5392,5473
86,"JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. ",5473,5555
87,She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag. ,5555,5626
88,"She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman. ",5626,5718
89,HE was sitting on a log; ,5718,5743
90," he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. ",5742,5806
91,When Jemima alighted he quite jumped. ,5806,5844
92,"""Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. ",5844,5906
93,Give me the herbs for the omelette. ,5906,5942
94,"Be sharp!"" ",5942,5953
95,He was rather abrupt. ,5953,5975
96,Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that. ,5975,6031
97,"She felt surprised, and uncomfortable. ",6031,6070
98,WHILE she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. ,6070,6144
99,"Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it. ",6144,6226
100,Jemima became much alarmed. ,6226,6254
101,"A MOMENT afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans. ",6254,6361
102,And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman. ,6361,6426
103,"PRESENTLY Kep opened the door of the shed, and let out Jemima Puddle-duck. ",6426,6501
104,Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them. ,6501,6592
105,He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping. ,6592,6652
106,JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs. ,6652,6724
107,"SHE laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched. ",6724,6827
108,Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; ,6827,6886
109, but she had always been a bad sitter.,6885,6924
