0,"Once upon a time there was a poor widow, who found an egg under a pile of brush as she was gathering kindlings in the forest. ",0,126
1,"She took it and placed it under a goose, and when the goose had hatched it, a little boy slipped out of the shell. ",126,241
2,"The widow had him baptized Knos, and such a lad was a rarity; ",241,303
3," for when no more than five years old he was grown, and taller than the tallest man. ",302,387
4,"And he ate in proportion, for he would swallow a whole batch of bread at a single sitting, and at last the poor widow had to go to the commissioners for the relief of the poor in order to get food for him. ",387,593
5,"But the town authorities said she must apprentice the boy at a trade, for he was big enough and strong enough to earn his own keep. ",593,725
6,So Knos was apprenticed to a smith for three years. ,725,777
7,"For his pay he asked a suit of clothes and a sword each year: a sword of five hundredweights the first year, one of ten hundredweights the second year, and one of fifteen hundredweights the third year. ",777,979
8,"But after he had been in the smithy only a few days, the smith was glad to give him all three suits and all three swords at once; ",979,1109
9, for he smashed all his iron and steel to bits. ,1108,1156
10,"Knos received his suits and swords, went to a knight's estate, and hired himself out as a serving-man. ",1156,1259
11,"Once he was told to go to the forest to gather firewood with the rest of the men, but sat at the table eating long after the others had driven off and when he had at last satisfied his hunger and was ready to start, he saw the two young oxen he was to drive waiting for him. ",1259,1534
12,"But he let them stand and went into the forest, seized the two largest trees growing there, tore them out by the roots, took one tree under each arm, and carried them back to the estate. ",1534,1721
13,"And he got there long before the rest, for they had to chop down the trees, saw them up and load them on the carts. ",1721,1837
14,On the following day Knos had to thresh. ,1837,1878
15,"First he hunted up the largest stone he could find, and rolled it around on the grain, so that all the corn was loosened from the ears. ",1878,2014
16,Then he had to separate the grain from the chaff. ,2014,2064
17,"So he made a hole in each side of the roof of the barn, and stood outside the barn and blew, and the chaff and straw flew out into the yard, and the corn remained lying in a heap on the floor. ",2064,2257
18,"His master happened to come along, laid a ladder against the barn, climbed up and looked down into one of the holes. ",2257,2374
19,"But Knos was still blowing, and the wind caught his master, and he fell down and was nearly killed on the stone pavement of the court. ",2374,2509
20,"""He's a dangerous fellow,"" thought his master. ",2509,2556
21,"It would be a good thing to be rid of him, otherwise he might do away with all of them; ",2556,2644
22," and besides, he ate so that it was all one could do to keep him fed. ",2643,2713
23,"So he called Knos in, and paid him his wages for the full year, on condition that he leave. ",2713,2805
24,"Knos agreed, but said he must first be decently provisioned for his journey. ",2805,2882
25,"So he was allowed to go into the store-house himself, and there he hoisted a flitch of bacon on each shoulder, slid a batch of bread under each arm, and took leave. ",2882,3047
26,But his master loosed the vicious bull on him. ,3047,3094
27,"Knos, however, grasped him by the horns, and flung him over his shoulder, and thus he went off. ",3094,3190
28,"Then he came to a thicket where he slaughtered the bull, roasted him and ate him together with a batch of bread. ",3190,3303
29,And when he had done this he had about taken the edge off his hunger. ,3303,3373
30,"Then he came to the king's court, where great sorrow reigned because, once upon a time, when the king was sailing out at sea, a sea troll had called up a terrible tempest, so that the ship was about to sink. ",3373,3581
31,"In order to escape with his life, the king had to promise the sea troll to give him whatever first came his way when he reached shore. ",3581,3716
32,"The king thought his hunting dog would be the first to come running to meet him, as usual; ",3716,3807
33, but instead his three young daughters came rowing out to meet him in a boat. ,3806,3884
34,"This filled the king with grief, and he vowed that whoever delivered his daughters should have one of them for a bride, whichever one he might choose. ",3884,4035
35,"But the only man who seemed to want to earn the reward was a tailor, named Red Peter. ",4035,4121
36,"Knos was given a place at the king's court, and his duty was to help the cook. ",4121,4200
37,"But he asked to be let off on the day the troll was to come and carry away the oldest princess, and they were glad to let him go; ",4200,4330
38, for when he had to rinse the dishes he broke the king's vessels of gold and silver; ,4329,4414
39," and when he was told to bring firewood, he brought in a whole wagon-load at once, so that the doors flew from their hinges. ",4413,4538
40,The princess stood on the sea-shore and wept and wrung her hands; ,4538,4604
41, for she could see what she had to expect. ,4603,4646
42,"Nor did she have much confidence in Red Peter, who sat on a willow-stump, with a rusty old sabre in his hand. ",4646,4756
43,"Then Knos came and tried to comfort the princess as well as he knew how, and asked her whether she would comb his hair. ",4756,4876
44,"Yes, he might lay his head in her lap, and she combed his hair. ",4876,4940
45,Suddenly there was a dreadful roaring out at sea. ,4940,4990
46,"It was the troll who was coming along, and he had five heads. ",4990,5052
47,Red Peter was so frightened that he rolled off his willow-stump. ,5052,5117
48,"""Knos, is that you?"" ",5117,5138
49,cried the troll. ,5138,5155
50,"""Yes,"" said Knos. ",5155,5173
51,"""Haul me up on the shore!"" ",5173,5200
52,said the troll. ,5200,5216
53,"""Pay out the cable!"" ",5216,5237
54,said Knos. ,5162,5173
55,Then he hauled the troll ashore; ,5248,5281
56," but he had his sword of five hundredweights at his side, and with it he chopped off all five of the troll's heads, and the princess was free. ",5280,5423
57,"But when Knos had gone off, Red Peter put his sabre to the breast of the princess, and told her he would kill her unless she said he was her deliverer. ",5423,5575
58,Then came the turn of the second princess. ,5575,5618
59,"Once more Red Peter sat on the willow-stump with his rusty sabre, and Knos asking to be let off for the day, went to the sea-shore and begged the princess to comb his hair, which she did. ",5618,5806
60,"Then along came the troll, and this time he had ten heads. ",5806,5865
61,"""Knos, is that you?"" ",5117,5138
62,asked the troll. ,5886,5903
63,"""Yes,"" said Knos. ",5155,5173
64,"""Haul me ashore!"" ",5921,5939
65,said the troll. ,5200,5216
66,"""Pay out the cable!"" ",5216,5237
67,said Knos. ,5162,5173
68,"And this time Knos had his sword of ten hundredweights at his side, and he cut off all ten of the troll's heads. ",5987,6100
69,And so the second princess was freed. ,6100,6138
70,"But Red Peter held his sabre at the princess' breast, and forced her to say that he had delivered her. ",6138,6241
71,Now it was the turn of the youngest princess. ,6241,6287
72,"When it was time for the troll to come, Red Peter was sitting on his willow-stump, and Knos came and begged the princess to comb his hair, and she did so. ",6287,6442
73,This time the troll had fifteen heads. ,6442,6481
74,"""Knos, is that you?"" ",5117,5138
75,asked the troll. ,5886,5903
76,"""Yes,"" said Knos. ",5155,5173
77,"""Haul me ashore!"" ",5921,5939
78,said the troll. ,5200,5216
79,"""Pay out the cable,"" said Knos. ",6571,6603
80,"Knos had his sword of fifteen hundredweights at his side, and with it he cut off all the troll's heads. ",6603,6707
81,"But the fifteen hundredweights were half-an-ounce short, and the heads grew on again, and the troll took the princess, and carried her off with him. ",6707,6856
82,"One day as Knos was going along, he met a man carrying a church on his back. ",6856,6933
83,"""You are a strong man, you are!"" ",6933,6966
84,said Knos. ,5162,5173
85,"""No, I am not strong,"" said he, ""but Knos at the king's court, he is strong; ",6977,7054
86," for he can take steel and iron, and weld them together with his hands as though they were clay."" ",7053,7151
87,"""Well, I'm the man of whom you are speaking,"" said Knos, ""come, let us travel together."" ",7151,7240
88,And so they wandered on. ,7240,7265
89,Then they met a man who carried a mountain of stone on his back. ,7265,7330
90,"""You are strong, you are!"" ",7330,7357
91,said Knos. ,5162,5173
92,"""No, I'm not strong,"" said the man with the mountain of stone, ""but Knos at the king's court, he is strong; ",7368,7476
93," for he can weld together steel and iron with his hands as though they were clay."" ",7475,7558
94,"""Well, I am that Knos, come let us travel together,"" said Knos. ",7558,7622
95,So all three of them traveled along together. ,7622,7668
96,Knos took them for a sea-trip; ,7668,7699
97, but I think they had to leave the church and the hill of stone ashore. ,7698,7770
98,"While they were sailing they grew thirsty, and lay alongside an island, and there on the island stood a castle, to which they decided to go and ask for a drink. ",7770,7931
99,Now this was the very castle in which the troll lived. ,7931,7986
100,"First the man with the church went, and when he entered the castle, there sat the troll with the princess on his lap, and she was very sad. ",7986,8126
101,He asked for something to drink. ,8126,8159
102,"""Help yourself, the goblet is on the table!"" ",8159,8204
103,said the troll. ,5200,5216
104,"But he got nothing to drink, for though he could move the goblet from its place, he could not raise it. ",8220,8324
105,Then the man with the hill of stone went into the castle and asked for a drink. ,8324,8404
106,"""Help yourself, the goblet is on the table!"" ",8159,8204
107,said the troll. ,5200,5216
108,"And he got nothing to drink either, for though he could move the goblet from its place, he could not raise it. ",8465,8576
109,"Then Knos himself went into the castle, and the princess was full of joy and leaped down from the troll's lap when she saw it was he. ",8576,8710
110,Knos asked for a drink. ,8710,8734
111,"""Help yourself,"" said the troll, ""the goblet is on the table!"" ",8734,8797
112,And Knos took the goblet and emptied it at a single draught. ,8797,8858
113,"Then he hit the troll across the head with the goblet, so that he rolled from the chair and died. ",8858,8956
114,"Knos took the princess back to the royal palace, and O, how happy every one was! ",8956,9037
115,"The other princesses recognized Knos again, for they had woven silk ribbons into his hair when they had combed it; ",9037,9152
116," but he could only marry one of the princesses, whichever one he preferred, so he chose the youngest. ",9151,9253
117,"And when the king died, Knos inherited the kingdom. ",9253,9305
118,"As for Red Peter, he had to go into the nail-barrel. ",9305,9358
119,And now you know all that I know.,9358,9392
