0,"Once upon a time there was a poor, poor boy. ",0,45
1,"He went to the king and begged to be taken into service as a shepherd, and all called him ""Sheep-Peter."" ",45,150
2,"While he was herding his sheep, he used to amuse himself with his crossbow. ",150,226
3,"One day he saw a crane sitting in an oak-tree, and wanted to shoot her. ",226,298
4,"The crane, however, hopped down further and further, and at last settled in the lowest branches. ",298,395
5,"Then she said: ""If you promise not to shoot me, I will help you whenever you are in trouble. ",395,488
6,"You need only to call out: 'God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!'"" ",488,578
7,With that the bird flew away. ,578,608
8,At length war broke out and the king had to take the field. ,608,668
9,Then Sheep-Peter came to the king and asked whether he might not be allowed to go along to war. ,668,764
10,"They gave him an old nag to ride, and he rode into a swamp along the highway, and there the horse died. ",764,868
11,So he sat down and clicked with his tongue; ,868,912
12, but the horse would not move. ,911,942
13,And the people who rode by had their sport with him; ,942,995
14, while the youth pretended to feel sad. ,994,1034
15,"When the people had all passed by, the youth went to the oak in which the Queen Crane dwelt. ",1034,1127
16,"Here he was given a black steed, a suit of brazen armor, and a silver sword. ",1127,1204
17,Thus he rode to battle and got there as quickly as he could wish. ,1204,1270
18,"Then he said: ""God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!"" ",1270,1346
19,With that he killed all the enemy and rode away again. ,1346,1401
20,"But the king thought that an angel had come to help him, and wanted to hold him back. ",1401,1487
21,"The youth, however, rode quickly back to the oak, took off his armor, went down to the swamp, and once more began to click to his horse. ",1487,1624
22,"When the people rode by they laughed and said: ""You were not along to-day, so you missed seeing how an angel came and killed all the enemy."" ",1624,1765
23,"And the youth pretended to feel sad, so sad. ",1765,1810
24,The following day the king once more had to take the field. ,1810,1870
25,And Sheep-Peter came to him and said he wanted to go along. ,1870,1930
26,"So they gave him an old nag to ride, and he rode into a swamp beside the highway. ",1930,2012
27,Then he sat down and clicked with his tongue; ,2012,2058
28, but the horse would not move. ,911,942
29,When the people rode by they had their sport with him; ,2088,2143
30," but the youth pretended to feel sad, so sad. ",2142,2188
31,"When the people had gone by, he went to the oak in which the Queen Crane dwelt, and was given a white steed, a suit of silver armor, and a golden sword. ",2188,2341
32,Thus equipped he rode to battle. ,2341,2374
33,"When he arrived he said: ""God aid me, and Queen Crane ... and I will succeed!"" ",2374,2453
34,"But he had forgotten to say ""stay by me,"" and so he was shot in the leg. ",2453,2526
35,"But the king took out his handkerchief, and tied up his leg. ",2526,2587
36,"Then the youth said once more: ""God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!"" ",2587,2680
37,And he slew all of the enemy. ,2680,2710
38,"Then the king thought he was an angel from heaven, and wanted to hold him. ",2710,2785
39,"But the youth rode quickly to the oak, took off his armor, and then went down to his nag in the swamp and tried to get it to move, while the soldiers were passing. ",2785,2949
40,"They laughed and said: ""You were not along to-day, and did not see how an angel came from heaven and killed all of the enemy."" ",2949,3076
41,The youth pretended to be very sad. ,3076,3112
42,On the third day all happened as before. ,3112,3153
43,The king took the field. ,3153,3178
44,The youth was given a wretched nag and rode it into a swamp beside the highway. ,3178,3258
45,"Then he began to click with his tongue but the nag would not go on, and the people who rode past laughed at him. ",3258,3371
46,He pretended to feel very sad; ,3371,3402
47," but when the people had passed, he went to the oak in which Queen Crane dwelt, and she gave him a red steed, a golden sword, and a golden suit of armor. ",3401,3555
48,"Thus equipped he rode to war, and all happened as before. ",3555,3613
49,"He said: ""God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!"" ",3613,3684
50,and slew all the enemy. ,3684,3708
51,The king thought he was an angel from heaven and wanted to hold him back by all means; ,3708,3795
52," but the youth rode quickly to the oak, took off his armor, and rode down to the swamp where he had his three nags. ",3794,3910
53,"He hid the king's handkerchief, and when the people passed by he was clicking with his tongue as usual. ",3910,4014
54,"Now the king had three princesses, and they were to be carried off by three meer-women. ",4014,4102
55,So the king had it proclaimed that whoever could rescue them should receive one of them for a wife. ,4102,4202
56,"When the day came on which the oldest princess was to be carried away, Sheep-Peter received a steed, a suit of armor and a sword from Queen Crane. ",4202,4349
57,"With them he rode to the castle, fetched the princess, took her before him on his steed, and then lay down on the sea-shore to sleep. ",4349,4483
58,He had a dog with him as well. ,4483,4514
59,And while he slept the princess wove her hair-ribbon into his hair. ,4514,4582
60,"Suddenly the meer-woman appeared, and she awakened him and bade him mount his steed. ",4582,4667
61,Many people had been standing there; ,4667,4704
62," but when the meer-woman appeared they all took fright, and climbed into tall trees. ",4703,4788
63,"But the youth said: ""God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!"" ",4788,4870
64,And then he slew the meer-woman. ,4870,4903
65,"Thereupon he rode quickly back to Queen Crane, took off his armor, and herded his sheep again. ",4903,4998
66,"But among the on-lookers had been a nobleman, who threatened the princess, and forced her to say that he had rescued her. ",4998,5120
67,And from Sheep-Peter no one heard a word. ,5120,5162
68,On the following day the second princess was to be carried off. ,5162,5226
69,"So Sheep-Peter went to Queen Crane, who gave him a steed, a suit of armor and a sword, and with them he rode to the castle, and fetched the second princess. ",5226,5383
70,When they reached the sea-shore the meer-woman had not yet appeared. ,5383,5452
71,"So the youth lay down to sleep and said to the princess: ""Wake me when the meer-woman comes, and if you cannot wake me, then tell my horse."" ",5452,5593
72,"With that he fell asleep, and meanwhile the princess wove a string of pearls into his hair. ",5593,5685
73,"When the meer-woman came, the princess tried to wake him; ",5685,5743
74," but he would not wake up at all, and so she told the horse to waken him. ",5742,5816
75,And the horse did wake him. ,5816,5844
76,"The great lords, however, who were standing about, climbed into the trees out of pure fright when the meer-woman appeared. ",5844,5967
77,"The youth took the princess on his steed, cried: ""God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!"" ",5967,6078
78,and with that he slew the meer-woman. ,6078,6116
79,"Then he rode quickly back to Queen Crane, took off his armor, and led his flock out to pasture. ",6116,6212
80,"But among the on-lookers had been a count, who threatened the princess, and said he would thrust her through with his sword if she did not swear he had rescued her. ",6212,6377
81,The princess did so out of fear; ,6377,6410
82, but from Sheep-Peter no one heard a word. ,6409,6452
83,On the third day the same thing happened. ,6452,6494
84,"Sheep-Peter was given a suit of armor, a sword and a steed by Queen Crane, and fetched the youngest princess. ",6494,6604
85,"When he lay down on the sea-shore to sleep, he said to her: ""When the meer-woman comes, wake me, and if you cannot wake me, then tell the horse to wake me, and if the horse cannot wake me, then ask the dog to wake me."" ",6604,6823
86,"When the meer-woman came, neither the princess nor the horse was able to wake him, and they had to call the dog to help them. ",6823,6949
87,"At last he woke up, took the princess on his horse, cried: ""God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!"" ",6949,7070
88,and slew the meer-woman. ,7070,7095
89,"Then he rode back again to Queen Crane, took off his armor and let his flock out to pasture. ",7095,7188
90,"Not long after, the deliverers of the princesses were to come to the castle and be married. ",7188,7280
91,But first the king asked his daughters which of the three each wanted to have. ,7280,7359
92,"So the oldest said: ""The gentleman from court,"" and the second said: ""the count,"" but the third said ""Sheep-Peter."" ",7359,7475
93,Then the king was very angry with his youngest daughter; ,7475,7532
94, for he did not believe for a moment that Sheep-Peter had delivered her. ,7531,7604
95,But she insisted and said she would take no one else. ,7604,7658
96,The king then presented an apple of pure gold to the count and the court gentleman; ,7658,7742
97, but Sheep-Peter got nothing. ,7741,7771
98,"Now all three of them were to hold a three-days' shooting-match, in order to see which was the best shot; ",7771,7877
99," for the king hoped that Sheep-Peter would make a proper laughing-stock of himself, and drop far behind the others without any effort on their part. ",7876,8025
100,But Sheep-Peter was so good a marksman that he hit everything at which he aimed. ,8025,8106
101,"And the very first day he shot a great deal, while the others shot but little. ",8106,8185
102,"Then they bought the game he had shot from him, and gave him a golden apple for it. ",8185,8269
103,"The same thing happened the second day, and thus he got the other gold apple. ",8269,8347
104,"But when Peter came home on the evening of the first and second day, he had only a crow dangling from his blunderbuss. ",8347,8466
105,"And when he met the king, he threw the crow to the ground and cried: ""There is my whole bag!"" ",8466,8560
106,On the third day all went as before. ,8560,8597
107,Sheep-Peter hit everything at which he aimed; ,8597,8643
108, but the others scored no hits. ,8642,8674
109,"Then Sheep-Peter promised them all he had bagged, if they would let him write what he chose on their necks. ",8674,8782
110,"They agreed to the bargain, and he wrote on the neck of each: ""A thief and a rascal."" ",8782,8868
111,"Then all three went home, and again Peter had no more than a crow to show. ",8868,8943
112,At night all three of them slept together in one room. ,8943,8998
113,"When they woke in the morning, the king came in to them, said good-morning, and asked how they were. ",8998,9099
114,But he was much surprised to see that Sheep-Peter was keeping them company. ,9099,9175
115,"Then the youth said: ""I was in the war, and slew all of the enemy!"" ",9175,9243
116,"""Ah!"" ",9243,9249
117,"said the king, ""you did not do that, it was an angel from heaven; ",9249,9315
118," for you were sitting in the swamp."" ",9314,9351
119,"Then Sheep-Peter drew out the king's handkerchief, and then the king recognized him. ",9351,9436
120,"Then the herdsman said: ""I also delivered the princesses!"" ",9436,9495
121,"But the king would not believe that, and laughed at him. ",9495,9552
122,And then the youngest princess came along and told how it all had happened. ,9552,9628
123,"And the youth took out the ribands of the other princesses, and the king had to believe that this, too, was true. ",9628,9742
124,"Then, Peter continued: ""I also shot all the game!"" ",9742,9793
125,"And again the king would not believe him and said: ""Nonsense, why you never brought home anything of an evening but a wretched crow!"" ",9793,9927
126,"Then Peter produced the golden apples: ""I was given this one for the first day, and the other for the second."" ",9927,10038
127,"""And what did you get for the third?"" ",10038,10076
128,asked the king. ,10076,10092
129,Then the shepherd showed him what he had written on the necks of the other suitors. ,10092,10176
130,"And when the king saw that, he had to believe him. ",10176,10227
131,"And so he really got the youngest princess, and with her half of the kingdom, and after the king's death, all of it. ",10227,10344
132,"But the two sham heroes got nothing at all, and had only their trouble for their pains.",10344,10432
