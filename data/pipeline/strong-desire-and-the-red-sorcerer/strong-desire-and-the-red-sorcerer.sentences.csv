0,"There was a man called Odshedoph, or the Child of Strong Desires, who had a wife and one son. ",0,94
1,"He had withdrawn his family from the village, where they had spent the winter, to the neighborhood of a distant forest, where game abounded. ",94,235
2,"This wood was a day's travel from his winter home, and under its ample shadow the wife fixed the lodge, while the husband went out to hunt. ",235,375
3,"Early in the evening he returned with a deer, and, being weary and athirst, he asked his son, whom he called Strong Desire, to go to the river for some water. ",375,534
4,"The son replied that it was dark, and he was afraid. ",534,587
5,"His father still urged him, saying that his mother, as well as himself, was tired, and the distance to the water very short. ",587,712
6,But no persuasion could overcome the young man's reluctance. ,712,773
7,He refused to go. ,773,791
8,"""Ah, my son,"" said the father, at last, ""if you are afraid to go to the river, you will never kill the Red Head."" ",791,905
9,The stripling was deeply vexed by this observation; ,905,957
10, it seemed to touch him to the very quick. ,956,999
11,He mused in silence. ,999,1020
12,"He refused to eat, and made no reply when spoken to. ",1020,1073
13,"He sat by the lodge door all the night through, looking up at the stars, and sighing like one sorely distressed. ",1073,1186
14,"The next day he asked his mother to dress the skin of the deer, and to make it into moccasins for him, while he busied himself in preparing a bow and arrows. ",1186,1344
15,"As soon as these were in readiness, he left the lodge one morning, at sunrise, without saying a word to his father or mother. ",1344,1470
16,"As he passed along, he fired one of his arrows into the air, which fell westward. ",1470,1552
17,"He took that course, and coming to the spot where the arrow had fallen, he was rejoiced to find it piercing the heart of a deer. ",1552,1681
18,"He refreshed himself with a meal of the venison, and the next morning he fired another arrow. ",1681,1775
19,"Following its course, after traveling all day he found that he had transfixed another deer. ",1775,1867
20,"In this manner he fired four arrows, and every evening he discovered that he had killed a deer. ",1867,1963
21,"By a strange oversight, he left the arrows sticking in the carcasses, and passed on without withdrawing them. ",1963,2073
22,"Having in this way no arrow for the fifth day, he was in great distress at night for the want of food. ",2073,2176
23,"At last he threw himself upon the earth in despair, concluding that he might as well perish there as go further. ",2176,2289
24,"But he had not lain long before he heard a hollow rumbling noise, in the ground beneath him, like that of an earthquake moving slowly along. ",2289,2430
25,"He sprang up, and discovered at a distance the figure of a human being, walking with a stick. ",2430,2524
26,"He looked attentively, and saw that the figure was walking in a wide beaten path in a prairie, leading from a dusky lodge to a lake, whose waters were black and turbid. ",2524,2693
27,"To his surprise, this lodge, which had not been in view when he cast himself upon the ground, was now near at hand. ",2693,2809
28,"He approached a little nearer, and concealed himself; ",2809,2863
29," and in a moment he discovered that the figure was no other than that of the terrible witch, the little old woman who makes war. ",2862,2991
30,"Her path to the lake was perfectly smooth and solid, and the noise Strong Desire had heard was caused by the striking of her walking staff upon the ground. ",2991,3147
31,"The top of this staff was decorated with a string of the toes and bills of birds of every kind, who, at every stroke of the stick, fluttered and sung their various notes in concert. ",3147,3329
32,"She entered her lodge and laid off her mantle, which was entirely composed of the scalps of women. ",3329,3428
33,"Before folding it, she shook it several times, and at every shake the scalps uttered loud shouts of laughter, in which the old hag joined. ",3428,3567
34,"The boy, who lingered at the door, was greatly alarmed, but he uttered no cry. ",3567,3646
35,"After laying by the cloak, she came directly to him. ",3646,3699
36,"Looking at him steadily, she informed him that she had known him from the time he had left his father's lodge, and had watched his movements. ",3699,3841
37,"She told him not to fear or despair, for she would be his protector and friend. ",3841,3921
38,"She invited him into her lodge, and gave him a supper. ",3921,3976
39,"During the repast, she questioned him as to his motives for visiting her. ",3976,4050
40,"He related his history, stated the manner in which he had been disgraced, and the difficulties he labored under. ",4050,4163
41,"""Now tell me truly,"" said the little old woman who makes war, ""you were afraid to go to the water in the dark."" ",4163,4275
42,"""I was,"" Strong Desire answered, promptly. ",4275,4318
43,"As he replied, the hag waved her staff. ",4318,4358
44,"The birds set up a clamorous cry, and the mantle shook violently as all the scalps burst into a hideous shout of laughter. ",4358,4481
45,"""And are you afraid now,"" she asked again. ",4481,4524
46,"""I am,"" again answered Strong Desire, without hesitation. ",4524,4582
47,"""But you are not afraid to speak the truth,"" rejoined the little old woman. ",4582,4658
48,"""You will be a brave man yet."" ",4658,4689
49,"She cheered him with the assurance of her friendship, and began at once to exercise her power upon him. ",4689,4793
50,"His hair being very short, she took a great leaden comb, and after drawing it through his locks several times, they became of a handsome length like those of a beautiful young woman. ",4793,4976
51,"She then proceeded to dress him as a female, furnishing him with the necessary garments, and tinting his face with colors of the most charming dye. ",4976,5124
52,"She gave him, too, a bowl of shining metal. ",5124,5168
53,"She directed him to put in his girdle a blade of scented sword-grass, and to proceed the next morning to the banks of the lake, which was no other than that over which the Red Head reigned. ",5168,5358
54,"Now Hah-Undo-Tah, or the Red Head, was a most powerful sorcerer, living upon an island in the centre of his realm of water, and he was the terror of all the country. ",5358,5524
55,"She informed him that there would be many Indians upon the island, who, as soon as they saw him use the shining bowl to drink with, would come and solicit him to be their wife, and to take him over to the island. ",5524,5737
56,"These offers he was to refuse, and to say that he had come a great distance to be the wife of the Red Head, and that if the chief could not seek her for himself, she would return to her village. ",5737,5932
57,"She said, that as soon as the Red Head heard of this he would come for her in his own canoe, in which she must embark. ",5932,6051
58,"""On reaching the shore,"" added the little old woman, ""you must consent to be his wife; ",6051,6138
59," and in the evening you are to induce him to take a walk out of the village, and when you have reached a lonesome spot, use the first opportunity to cut off his head with the blade of grass."" ",6137,6329
60,She also gave Strong Desire general advice how he was to conduct himself to sustain his assumed character of a woman. ,6329,6447
61,His fear would scarcely permit him to consent to engage in an adventure attended with so much danger; ,6447,6549
62," but the recollection of his father's looks and reproaches of the want of courage, decided him. ",6548,6644
63,"Early in the morning he left the lodge of the little old woman who makes war, which was clouded in a heavy brackish fog, so thick and heavy to breathe, that he with difficulty made his way forth. ",6644,6840
64,"When he turned to look back for it, it was gone. ",6840,6889
65,"He took the hard beaten path to the banks of the lake, and made for the water at a point directly opposite the Red Head's lodge. ",6889,7018
66,Where he now stood it was beautiful day. ,7018,7059
67,"The heavens were clear, and the sun shone out as brightly to Strong Desire as on the first morning when he had put forth his little head from the door of his father's lodge. ",7059,7233
68,"He had not been long there, sauntering along the beach, when he displayed the glittering bowl by dipping water from the lake. ",7233,7359
69,Very soon a number of canoes came off from the island. ,7359,7414
70,"The men admired his dress, and were charmed with his beauty, and almost with one voice they all made proposals of marriage. ",7414,7538
71,"These, Strong Desire promptly declined. ",7538,7578
72,"When this was reported to Red Head, he ordered his royal bark to be launched by his chosen men of the oar, and crossed over to see this wonderful girl. ",7578,7730
73,"As they approached the shore, Strong Desire saw that the ribs of the sorcerer's canoe were formed of living rattlesnakes, whose heads pointed outward to guard him from his enemies. ",7730,7911
74,"Being invited, he had no sooner stepped into the canoe, than they began to hiss and rattle furiously, which put him in a great fright; ",7911,8046
75," but the magician spoke to them, when they became pacified and quiet. ",8045,8115
76,Shortly after they were at the landing upon the island. ,8115,8171
77,The marriage took place immediately; ,8171,8208
78, and the bride made presents of various valuables which had been furnished her by the old witch who inhabited the cloudy lodge. ,8207,8335
79,"As they were sitting in the lodge, surrounded by the friends and relatives, the mother of the Red Head regarded the face of her new daughter-in-law for a long time with fixed attention. ",8335,8521
80,From this scrutiny she was convinced that this singular and hasty marriage boded no good to her son. ,8521,8622
81,"She drew him aside, and disclosed to him her suspicions. ",8622,8679
82,"This can be no female, said she; ",8679,8712
83," she has the figure and manners, the countenance, and more especially the eyes, are beyond a doubt those of a man. ",8711,8826
84,"Her husband rejected her suspicions, and rebuked her severely for entertaining such notions of her own daughter-in-law. ",8826,8946
85,"She still urged her doubts, which so vexed the husband that he broke his pipe-stem in her face, and called her an owl. ",8946,9065
86,"This act astonished the company, who sought an explanation; ",9065,9125
87," and it was no sooner given, than the mock bride, rising with an air of offended dignity, informed the Red Head that after receiving so gross an affront from his relatives she could not think of remaining with him as his wife, but should forthwith return to her own friends. ",9124,9399
88,"With a toss of the head, like that of an angry female, Strong Desire left the lodge, followed by Red Head, and walked away until he came to the beach of the island, near the spot where they had first landed. ",9399,9607
89,"Red Head entreated him to remain, urging every motive, and making all sorts of magnificent promises-none of which seemed to make the least impression. ",9607,9758
90,"Strong Desire, Red Head thought, was very hard-hearted. ",9758,9814
91,"During these appeals they had seated themselves upon the ground, and Red Head, in great affliction, reclined his head upon his fancied wife's lap. ",9814,9961
92,"Strong Desire now changed his manner, was very kind and soothing, and suggested in the most winning accent that if Red Head would sleep soundly for awhile he might possibly dream himself out of all his troubles. ",9961,10173
93,"Red Head, delighted at so happy a prospect, said that he would fall asleep immediately. ",10173,10261
94,"""You have killed a good many men in your time, Red Head,"" said Strong Desire, by way of suggesting an agreeable train of ideas to the sorcerer. ",10261,10405
95,"""Hundreds,"" answered Red Head; ",10405,10436
96," ""and what is better, now that I am fairly settled in life by this happy marriage, I shall be able to give my whole attention to massacre."" ",10435,10575
97,"""And you will kill hundreds more,"" interposed Strong Desire, in the most insinuating manner imaginable. ",10575,10679
98,"""Just so, my dear,"" Red Head replied, with a great leer; ",10679,10736
99," ""thousands. ",10735,10748
100,There will be no end to my delicious murders. ,10748,10794
101,I love dearly to kill people. ,10794,10824
102,"I would like to kill you if you were not my wife."" ",10824,10875
103,"""There, there,"" said Strong Desire, with the coaxing air of a little coquette, ""go to sleep; ",10875,10968
104," that's a good Red Head."" ",10967,10993
105,"No other subject of conversation occurring to the chief, now that he had exhausted the delightful topic of wholesale murder, he straightway fell into a deep sleep. ",10993,11157
106,The chance so anxiously sought for had come; ,11157,11202
107," and Strong Desire, with a smiling eye, drawing his blade of grass with lightning swiftness once across the neck of the Red Head, severed the huge and wicked head from the body. ",11201,11379
108,"In a moment, stripping off his woman's dress, underneath which he had all along worn his male attire, Strong Desire seized the bleeding trophy, plunged into the lake, and swam safely over to the main shore. ",11379,11586
109,"He had scarcely reached it, when, looking back, he saw amid the darkness the torches of persons come out in search of the new married couple. ",11586,11728
110,"He listened until they had found the headless body, and he heard their piercing shrieks of rage and sorrow as he took his way to the lodge of his kind adviser. ",11728,11888
111,"The little old woman who makes war was in an excellent humor, and she received Strong Desire with rejoicing. ",11888,11997
112,"She admired his prudence, and assured him his bravery should never be questioned again. ",11997,12085
113,"Lifting up the head, which she gazed upon with vast delight, she said he need only have brought the scalp. ",12085,12192
114,"Cutting off a lock of the hair for herself, she told him he might now return with the head, which would be evidence of an achievement that would cause his own people to respect him. ",12192,12374
115,"""In your way home,"" added the little old woman, ""you will meet with but one difficulty. ",12374,12462
116,"Maunkahkeesh, the Spirit of the Earth, requires an offering or sacrifice from all of her sons who perform extraordinary deeds. ",12462,12589
117,As you walk along in a prairie there will be an earthquake; ,12589,12649
118, the earth will open and divide the prairie in the middle. ,12648,12707
119,"Take this partridge and throw it into the opening, and instantly spring over it."" ",12707,12789
120,"With many thanks to the little old witch, who had so faithfully befriended him, Strong Desire took leave of her, and having, by the course pointed out, safely passed the earthquake, he arrived near his own village. ",12789,13004
121,He secretly hid his precious trophy. ,13004,13041
122,"On entering the village, he found that his parents had returned from the place of their spring encampment by the wood-side, and that they were in heavy sorrowing for their son, whom they supposed to be lost. ",13041,13249
123,"One and another of the young men had presented themselves to the disconsolate parents, and said, ""Look up, I am your son;""",13249,13371
124,""" but when they looked up, they beheld not the familiar face of Strong Desire. ",13370,13449
125,"Having been often deceived in this manner, when their own son in truth presented himself they sat with their heads down, and with their eyes nearly blinded with weeping. ",13449,13619
126,It was some time before they could be prevailed upon to bestow a glance upon him. ,13619,13701
127,"It was still longer before they could recognize him as their son who had refused to draw water from the river, at night, for fear, for his countenance was no longer that of a timid stripling; ",13701,13893
128," it was that of a man who has seen and done great things, and who has the heart to do greater still. ",13892,13993
129,When he recounted his adventures they believed him mad. ,13993,14049
130,"The young men laughed at him-him, Strong Desire-who feared to walk to the river at night-time. ",14049,14144
131,"He left the lodge, and ere their laughter had ceased, returned with his trophy. ",14144,14224
132,"He held aloft the head of the Red Sorcerer, with the great ghastly leer which lighted it up before his last sleep, at prospect of a thousand future murders, fresh upon it. ",14224,14396
133,"It was easily recognized, and the young men who had scoffed at Strong Desire shrunk into the corners out of sight. ",14396,14511
134,Strong Desire had conquered the terrible Red Head! ,14511,14562
135,All doubts of the truth of his adventures were dispelled. ,14562,14620
136,"He was greeted with joy, and placed among the first warriors of the nation. ",14620,14696
137,"He finally became a chief, and his family were ever after respected and esteemed.",14696,14778
