0,"A prize, or rather two prizes, a great one and a small one, had been awarded for the greatest swiftness in running,--not in a single race, but for the whole year. ",0,163
1,"""I obtained the first prize,"" said the hare. ",163,208
2,"""Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; ",208,316
3," but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself."" ",315,414
4,"""No,"" said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; ",414,495
5," ""there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance. ",494,562
6,"I have heard many respectable people say so, and I can quite understand it. ",562,638
7,The snail certainly took half a year to get over the threshold of the door; ,638,714
8," but he injured himself, and broke his collar-bone by the haste he made. ",713,786
9,"He gave himself up entirely to the race, and ran with his house on his back, which was all, of course, very praiseworthy; ",786,908
10," and therefore he obtained the second prize."" ",907,953
11,"""I think I ought to have had some consideration too,"" said the swallow. ",953,1025
12,"""I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flight than I am; ",1025,1098
13, and how far I have been! ,1097,1123
14,"far, far away."" ",1123,1139
15,"""Yes, that is your misfortune,"" said the fence-rail; ",1139,1192
16," ""you are so fickle, so unsettled; ",1191,1226
17, you must always be travelling about into foreign lands when the cold commences here. ,1225,1311
18,You have no love of fatherland in you. ,1311,1350
19,"There can be no consideration for you."" ",1350,1390
20,"""But now, if I have been lying the whole winter in the moor,"" said the swallow, ""and suppose I slept the whole time, would that be taken into account?"" ",1390,1542
21,"""Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen,"" said he, ""that you have slept away half your time in fatherland; ",1542,1652
22," then you will be treated with some consideration."" ",1651,1703
23,"""I deserved the first prize, and not the second,"" said the snail. ",1703,1769
24,"""I know so much, at least, that the hare only ran from cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay. ",1769,1885
25,"I, on the other hand, made running the business of my life, and have become a cripple in the service. ",1885,1987
26,"If any one had a first prize, it ought to have been myself. ",1987,2047
27,But I do not understand chattering and boasting; ,2047,2096
28," on the contrary, I despise it."" ",2095,2128
29,And the snail spat at them with contempt. ,2128,2170
30,"""I am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize--at least, those for which I voted--was given with just and proper consideration,"" said the old boundary post in the wood, who was a member of the committee of judges. ",2170,2394
31,"""I always act with due order, consideration, and calculation. ",2394,2456
32,"Seven times have I already had the honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes, and to vote; ",2456,2559
33, but to-day is the first time I have been able to carry out my will. ,2558,2627
34,"I always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet from the beginning, and the second by going through from the end. ",2627,2755
35,"Be so kind as to give me your attention, and I will explain to you how I reckon from the beginning. ",2755,2855
36,"The eighth letter from A is H, and there we have H for hare; ",2855,2916
37, therefore I awarded to the hare the first prize. ,2915,2965
38,"The eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is S, and therefore the snail received the second prize. ",2965,3069
39,"Next year, the letter I will have its turn for the first prize, and the letter R for the second."" ",3069,3167
40,"""I should really have voted for myself,"" said the mule, ""if I had not been one of the judges on the committee. ",3167,3278
41,"Not only the rapidity with which advance is made, but every other quality should have due consideration; ",3278,3383
42," as, for instance, how much weight a candidate is able to draw; ",3382,3446
43," but I have not brought this quality forward now, nor the sagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the cunning with which he suddenly springs aside and doubles, to lead people on a false track, thinking he has concealed himself. ",3445,3673
44,No; ,3673,3677
45," there is something else on which more stress should be laid, and which ought not be left unnoticed. ",3676,3777
46,I mean that which mankind call the beautiful. ,3777,3823
47,It is on the beautiful that I particularly fix my eyes. ,3823,3879
48,I observed the well-grown ears of the hare; ,3879,3923
49, it is a pleasure to me to observe how long they are. ,3922,3976
50,It seemed as if I saw myself again in the days of my childhood; ,3976,4040
51," and so I voted for the hare."" ",4039,4070
52,"""Buz,"" said the fly; ",4070,4091
53," ""there, I'm not going to make a long speech; ",4090,4136
54, but I wish to say something about hares. ,4135,4177
55,"I have really overtaken more than one hare, when I have been seated on the engine in front of a railway train. ",4177,4288
56,I often do so. ,4288,4303
57,One can then so easily judge of one's own swiftness. ,4303,4356
58,"Not long ago, I crushed the hind legs of a young hare. ",4356,4411
59,He had been running a long time before the engine; ,4411,4462
60, he had no idea that I was travelling there. ,4461,4506
61,"At last he had to stop in his career, and the engine ran over his hind legs, and crushed them; ",4506,4601
62, for I set upon it. ,4600,4620
63,"I left him lying there, and rode on farther. ",4620,4665
64,I call that conquering him; ,4665,4693
65," but I do not want the prize."" ",4692,4723
66,"""It really seems to me,"" thought the wild rose, though she did not express her opinion aloud--it is not in her nature to do so,--though it would have been quite as well if she had; ",4723,4904
67," ""it certainly seems to me that the sunbeam ought to have had the honor of receiving the first prize. ",4903,5005
68,The sunbeam flies in a few minutes along the immeasurable path from the sun to us. ,5005,5088
69,"It arrives in such strength, that all nature awakes to loveliness and beauty; ",5088,5166
70, we roses blush and exhale fragrance in its presence. ,5165,5219
71,Our worshipful judges don't appear to have noticed this at all. ,5219,5283
72,"Were I the sunbeam, I would give each one of them a sun stroke; ",5283,5347
73," but that would only make them mad, and they are mad enough already. ",5346,5415
74,"I only hope,"" continued the rose, ""that peace may reign in the wood. ",5415,5484
75,"It is glorious to bloom, to be fragrant, and to live; ",5484,5538
76, to live in story and in song. ,5537,5568
77,"The sunbeam will outlive us all."" ",5568,5602
78,"""What is the first prize?"" ",5602,5629
79,"asked the earthworm, who had overslept the time, and only now came up. ",5629,5700
80,"""It contains a free admission to a cabbage-garden,"" replied the mule. ",5700,5770
81,"""I proposed that as one of the prizes. ",5770,5809
82,The hare most decidedly must have it; ,5809,5847
83," and I, as an active and thoughtful member of the committee, took especial care that the prize should be one of advantage to him; ",5846,5976
84, so now he is provided for. ,5975,6003
85,"The snail can now sit on the fence, and lick up moss and sunshine. ",6003,6070
86,He has also been appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing. ,6070,6145
87,It is worth much to know that one of the numbers is a man of talent in the thing men call a 'committee.' ,6145,6250
88,I must say I expect much in the future; ,6250,6290
89," we have already made such a good beginning.""",6289,6335
