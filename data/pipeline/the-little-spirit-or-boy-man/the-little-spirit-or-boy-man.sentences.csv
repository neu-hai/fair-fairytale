0,"In a little lodge at a beautiful spot on a lake shore, alone with his sister, lived a boy remarkable for the smallness of his stature. ",0,135
1,"Many large rocks were scattered around their habitation, and it had a very wild and out-of-the-way look. ",135,240
2,The boy grew no larger as he advanced in years. ,240,288
3,"Yet, small as he was, he had a big spirit of his own, and loved dearly to play the master in the lodge. ",288,392
4,One day in winter he told his sister to make him a ball to play with. ,392,462
5,He meant to have some sport along the shore on the clear ice. ,462,524
6,"When she handed him the ball, his sister cautioned him not to go too far. ",524,598
7,"He laughed at her, and ran off in high glee, throwing his ball before him and running after it at full speed. ",598,708
8,He went as fast as his ball. ,708,737
9,At last his ball flew to a great distance. ,737,780
10,He followed as fast as he could. ,780,813
11,"After he had run forward for some time, he saw what seemed four dark spots upon the ice, straight before him. ",813,923
12,"When he came up to the shore he was surprised to see four large, tall men, lying on the ice, spearing fish. ",923,1031
13,"They were four brothers, who looked exactly alike. ",1031,1082
14,"As the little boy-man approached them, the nearest looked up. ",1082,1144
15,In his turn he was surprised to see such a tiny being. ,1144,1199
16,"Turning to his brothers, he said: ""Tia! ",1199,1239
17,look! ,1239,1245
18,"see what a little fellow is here."" ",1245,1280
19,The three others then looked up too. ,1280,1317
20,"Seeing these four faces, as if they had been one, the little spirit or boy-man said to himself: ""Four in one! ",1317,1427
21,"What a time they must have in choosing their hunting-shirts!"" ",1427,1489
22,"After they had all stared for a moment at the boy, they covered their heads, intent in searching for fish. ",1489,1596
23,"The boy thought to himself: ""These four-faces fancy that I am to be put off without notice because I am so little. ",1596,1711
24,They are so broad and long. ,1711,1739
25,They shall find out. ,1739,1760
26,"I may find a way to teach them that I am not to be treated so lightly."" ",1760,1832
27,"After they were covered up, the boy-man, looking sharply about, saw that among them they had caught one large trout, which was lying just by their side. ",1832,1985
28,"Stealing along, he slyly seized it. ",1985,2021
29,"Placing his fingers in the gills, and tossing his ball before him, he ran off at full speed. ",2021,2114
30,They heard the pattering of his little steps upon the ice. ,2114,2173
31,"When the four looked up all together, they saw their fine trout sliding away, as if of itself, at a great rate, the boy being so small that he could not be distinguished from the fish. ",2173,2358
32,"""See!"" ",2358,2365
33,"they cried out, ""our fish is running away on the dry land!"" ",2365,2425
34,"When they stood up they could just see, over the fish's head, that it was the boy-man who was carrying it off. ",2425,2536
35,"The little spirit reached the lodge, and having left the trout at the door, he told his sister to go out and bring in the fish he had brought home. ",2536,2684
36,"She exclaimed, ""Where could you have got it? ",2684,2729
37,"I hope you have not stolen it."" ",2729,2761
38,"""Oh,"" he replied, ""I found it on the ice. ",2761,2803
39,It was caught in our lake. ,2803,2830
40,Have we no right to a little lake of our own? ,2830,2876
41,"I shall claim all the fish that come out of its waters."" ",2876,2933
42,"""How,"" the sister asked again, ""could you have got it there?"" ",2933,2995
43,"""No matter,"" said the boy; ",2995,3022
44," ""go and cook it."" ",3021,3040
45,It was as much as the girl could do to drag the great trout within doors. ,3040,3114
46,"She cooked it, and its flavor was so delicious that she asked no more questions as to how he had come by it. ",3114,3223
47,The next morning the little spirit or boy-man set off as he had the day before. ,3223,3303
48,He made all sorts of sport with his ball as he frolicked along. ,3303,3367
49,"High over his head he would toss it, straight up into the air; ",3367,3430
50, then far before him. ,3429,3451
51,"And again, in mere merriment of spirit, he would send it bounding back, as if he had plenty of speed and enough to spare in running back after it. ",3451,3598
52,"The ball leaped and bounded about, and glided through the air as if it were a live thing, and enjoyed the sport as much as the boy-man himself. ",3598,3742
53,"When he came within hail of the four large men, who were fishing there every day, he cast his ball with such force that it rolled into the ice-hole about which they were busy. ",3742,3918
54,"The boy, standing on the shore of the lake, called out: ""Four-in-one, pray hand me my ball."" ",3918,4011
55,"""No, indeed,"" they answered, setting up a grim laugh which curdled their four dark faces all at once, ""we shall not."" ",4011,4129
56,With their fishing-spears they thrust the ball under the ice. ,4129,4191
57,"""Good!"" ",4191,4199
58,"said the boy-man, ""we shall see."" ",4199,4233
59,Saying which he rushed upon the four brothers and thrust them at one push into the water. ,4233,4323
60,"His ball bounded back to the surface, and, picking it up, he ran off, tossing it before him in his own sportive way. ",4323,4440
61,"Outstripping it in speed he soon reached home, and remained within till the next morning. ",4440,4530
62,"The four brothers, rising up from the water at the same time, dripping and angry, roared out in one voice a terrible threat of vengeance, which they promised to execute the next day. ",4530,4713
63,"They knew the boy's speed, and that they could by no means overtake him. ",4713,4786
64,"By times in the morning, the four brothers were stirring in their lodge, and getting ready to look after their revenge. ",4786,4906
65,"Their old mother, who lived with them, begged them not to go. ",4906,4968
66,"""Better,"" said she, ""now that your clothes are dry, to think no more of the ducking than to go and all four of you get your heads broken, as you surely will. ",4968,5126
67,"That boy is a monedo or he could not perform such feats as he does."" ",5126,5195
68,But her sons paid no heed to this wise advice. ,5195,5242
69,"Raising a great war-cry, which frightened the birds overhead nearly out of their feathers, they started for the boy's lodge among the rocks. ",5242,5383
70,"The little spirit or boy-man heard them roaring forth their threats as they approached, but he did not appear to be disquieted in the least. ",5383,5524
71,His sister as yet had heard nothing. ,5524,5561
72,"After a while she thought she could distinguish the noise of snow-shoes on the snow, at a distance, but rapidly advancing. ",5561,5684
73,"She looked out, and seeing the four large men coming straight to their lodge she was in great fear, and running in, exclaimed: ""He is coming, four times as strong as ever!"" ",5684,5857
74,for she supposed that the one man whom her brother had offended had become so angry as to make four of himself in order to wreak his vengeance. ,5857,6001
75,"The boy-man said, ""Why do you mind them? ",6001,6042
76,"Give me something to eat."" ",6042,6069
77,"""How can you think of eating at such a time?"" ",6069,6115
78,she replied. ,6115,6128
79,"""Do as I request you, and be quick."" ",6128,6165
80,"She then gave little spirit his dish, and he commenced eating. ",6165,6228
81,Just then the brothers came to the door. ,6228,6269
82,"""See!"" ",2358,2365
83,"cried the sister, ""the man with four heads!"" ",6276,6321
84,"The brothers were about to lift the curtain at the door, when the boy-man turned his dish upside down. ",6321,6424
85,"Immediately the door was closed with a stone, upon which the four brothers set to work and hammered with their clubs with great fury. ",6424,6558
86,At length they succeeded in making a slight opening. ,6558,6611
87,"One of the brothers presented his face at this little window, and rolled his eye about at the boy-man in a very threatening way. ",6611,6740
88,"The little spirit, who, when he had closed the door, had returned to his meal, which he was quietly eating, took up his bow and arrow which lay by his side, He let fly the shaft, which, striking the man in the head, he fell back. ",6740,6970
89,"The boy-man merely called out ""Number one"" as he fell, and went on with his meal. ",6970,7052
90,"In a moment a second face, just like the first, presented itself. ",7052,7118
91,"As he raised his bow, his sister said to him: ""What is the use? ",7118,7182
92,"You have killed that man already."" ",7182,7217
93,"Little spirit fired his arrow--the man fell--he called out ""Number two,"" and continued his meal. ",7217,7314
94,"The two others of the four brothers were dispatched in the same quiet way, and counted off as ""Number three"" and ""Number four."" ",7314,7442
95,"After they were all well disposed of in this way, the boy-man directed his sister to go out and see them. ",7442,7548
96,"She presently ran back, saying: ""There are four of them."" ",7548,7606
97,"""Of course,"" the boy-man answered, ""and there always shall be four of them."" ",7606,7683
98,"Going out himself, the boy-man raised the brothers to their feet, and giving each a push, one with his face to the East, another to the West, a third to the South, and the last to the North, he sent them off to wander about the earth. ",7683,7918
99,"Whenever you see four men just alike, they are the four brothers whom the little spirit or boy-man dispatched upon their travels. ",7918,8048
100,But this was not the last display of the boy-man's power. ,8048,8106
101,"When spring came on, and the lake began to sparkle in the morning sun, the boy-man said to his sister: ""Make me a new set of arrows, and a bow."" ",8106,8251
102,"Although he provided for their support, the little spirit never performed household or hard work of any kind, and his sister obeyed. ",8251,8384
103,"When she had made the weapons, which, though they were very small, were beautifully wrought and of the best stuff the field and wood could furnish, she again cautioned him not to shoot into the lake. ",8384,8584
104,"""She thinks,"" said the boy-man to himself, ""I can see no further into the water than she. ",8584,8674
105,"My sister shall learn better."" ",8674,8705
106,"Regardless of her warnings, he on purpose discharged a shaft into the lake. ",8705,8781
107,"He waded out into the water till he got into its depth, and paddled about for his arrow, so as to call the attention of his sister, and as if to show that he hardily braved her advice. ",8781,8966
108,"She hurried to the shore, calling on him to return. ",8966,9018
109,"But instead of heeding her, he cried out: ""You of the red fins, come and swallow me!"" ",9018,9104
110,"Although his sister did not clearly understand whom her brother was addressing, she too called out: ""Don't mind the foolish boy!"" ",9104,9234
111,"The boy-man's order seemed to be best attended to, for immediately a monstrous fish came and swallowed him. ",9234,9342
112,"Before disappearing entirely, catching a glimpse of his sister standing in despair upon the shore, the boy-man hallooed out to her: ""Me-zush-ke-zin-ance!"" ",9342,9497
113,She wondered what he meant. ,9497,9525
114,At last it occurred to her that it must be an old moccasin. ,9525,9585
115,"She accordingly ran to the lodge, and bringing one, she tied it to a string attached to a tree, and cast it into the water. ",9585,9709
116,The great fish said to the boy-man under water. ,9709,9757
117,"""What is that floating?"" ",9757,9782
118,"To which the boy-man replied: ""Go, take hold of it, swallow it as fast as you can. ",9782,9865
119,"It is a great delicacy."" ",9865,9890
120,"The fish darted toward the old shoe and swallowed it, making of it a mere mouthful. ",9890,9974
121,"The boy-man laughed in himself, but said nothing, till the fish was fairly caught, when he took hold of the line and began to pull himself in his fish-carriage ashore. ",9974,10142
122,"The sister, who was watching all this time, opened wide her eyes as the huge fish came up and up upon the shore. ",10142,10255
123,She opened them still more when the fish seemed to speak. ,10255,10313
124,"She heard from within a voice, saying, ""Make haste and release me from this nasty place."" ",10313,10403
125,"It was her brother's voice, which she was accustomed to obey. ",10403,10465
126,"She made haste with her knife to open a door in the side of the fish, from which the boy-man presently leaped forth. ",10465,10582
127,"He lost no time in ordering her to cut it up and dry it, telling her that their spring supply of meat was now provided. ",10582,10702
128,The sister now began to believe that her brother was an extraordinary boy. ,10702,10777
129,Yet she was not altogether satisfied in her mind that he was greater than the rest of the world. ,10777,10874
130,"They sat, one evening, in the lodge, musing with each other in the dark, by the light of each other's eyes--for they had no other of any kind--when the sister said, ""My brother, it is strange that you, who can do so much, are no wiser than the Ko-ko, who gets all his light from the moon; ",10874,11163
131," which shines or not, as it pleases."" ",11162,11200
132,"""And is not that light enough?"" ",11200,11232
133,asked the little spirit. ,11232,11257
134,"""Quite enough,"" the sister replied. ",11257,11293
135,"""If it would but come within the lodge and not sojourn out in the tree-tops and among the clouds."" ",11293,11392
136,"""We will have a light of our own, sister,"" said the boy-man. ",11392,11453
137,"Casting himself upon a mat by the door, he commenced singing: Fire-fly, fire-fly, bright little thing, Light me to bed and my song I will sing. ",11453,11597
138,"Give me your light, as you fly o'er my head, That I may merrily go to my bed. ",11597,11675
139,"Give me your light o'er the grass as you creep, That I may joyfully go to my sleep. ",11675,11759
140,"Come, little fire-fly, come little beast, Come! ",11759,11807
141,and I'll make you to-morrow a feast. ,11807,11844
142,"Come, little candle, that flies as I sing, Bright little fairy-bug, night's little king. ",11844,11933
143,Come and I'll dream as you guide me along. ,11933,11976
144,"Come and I'll pay you, my bug, with a song. ",11976,12020
145,"As the boy-man chanted this call, they came in at first one by one, then in couples, till at last, swarming in little armies, the fire-flies lit up the little lodge with a thousand sparkling lamps, just as the stars were lighting the mighty hollow of the sky without. ",12020,12288
146,"The faces of the sister and brother shone upon each other, from their opposite sides of the lodge, with a kindly gleam of mutual trustfulness. ",12288,12431
147,Never more from that hour did a doubt of each other darken their little household.,12431,12514
