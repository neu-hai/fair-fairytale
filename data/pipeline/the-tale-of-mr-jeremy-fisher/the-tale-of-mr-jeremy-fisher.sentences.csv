1," he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat. ",60,157
2,"THE boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. ",157,224
3,It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond. ,224,280
4,"MR. JEREMY took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. ",280,350
5,"""I know a good place for minnows,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. ",350,409
6,MR. JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it. ,409,477
7,Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. ,477,547
8,He had the dearest little red float. ,547,584
9,"His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end. ",584,711
10,"THE rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float. ",711,791
11,"""This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. ",791,877
12,"HE punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket. ",877,963
13,"""I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. ",963,1056
14,A GREAT big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes. ,1056,1158
15,"Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich. ",1158,1245
16,ONCE or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond. ,1245,1352
17,"""I trust that is not a rat,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; ",1352,1405
18," ""I think I had better get away from here."" ",1404,1448
19,"MR. JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. ",1448,1524
20,There was a bite almost directly; ,1524,1558
21, the float gave a tremendous bobbit! ,1557,1594
22,"""A minnow! ",1594,1605
23,a minnow! ,1605,1615
24,"I have him by the nose!"" ",1615,1640
25,"cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod. ",1640,1685
26,BUT what a horrible surprise! ,1685,1715
27,"Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines! ",1715,1821
28,"THE stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. ",1821,1920
29,Then he jumped back into the water. ,1920,1956
30,"AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher. ",1956,2046
31,AND while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing happened; ,2046,2198
32," a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh! ",2197,2291
33,A GREAT big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! ,2291,2344
34,"with a splash--and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, ""Ow! ",2344,2402
35,Ow! ,2398,2402
36,"Ow!""-",2406,2411
37,--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond! ,2410,2473
38,"BUT the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; ",2473,2593
39, and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes. ,2592,2652
40,"MR. JEREMY bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; ",2652,2759
41, and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond. ,2758,2815
42,"HE scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters. ",2815,2934

44,said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. ,385,409
45,"""I have lost my rod and basket; ",2994,3026
46," but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!"" ",3025,3117
47,"HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. ",3117,3199
48,"He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder. ",3199,3270
49,"SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat, AND Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag. ",3270,3398
50,AND instead of a nice dish of minnows--they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce; ,3398,3490
51, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; ,3489,3530
52, but _I_ think it must have been nasty!,3529,3569
