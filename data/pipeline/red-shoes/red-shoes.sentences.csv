0,"Once upon a time there was little girl, pretty and dainty. ",0,59
1,"But in summer time she was obliged to go barefooted because she was poor, and in winter she had to wear large wooden shoes, so that her little instep grew quite red. ",59,225
2,In the middle of the village lived an old shoemaker's wife; ,225,285
3," she sat down and made, as well as she could, a pair of little shoes out of some old pieces of red cloth. ",284,390
4,"They were clumsy, but she meant well, for they were intended for the little girl, whose name was Karen. ",390,494
5,Karen received the shoes and wore them for the first time on the day of her mother's funeral. ,494,588
6,They were certainly not suitable for mourning; ,588,635
7," but she had no others, and so she put her bare feet into them and walked behind the humble coffin. ",634,734
8,"Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an old lady; ",734,801
9," she looked at the little girl, and taking pity on her, said to the clergyman, ""Look here, if you will give me the little girl, I will take care of her."" ",800,954
10,"Karen believed that this was all on account of the red shoes, but the old lady thought them hideous, and so they were burnt. ",954,1079
11,Karen herself was dressed very neatly and cleanly; ,1079,1130
12," she was taught to read and to sew, and people said that she was pretty. ",1129,1202
13,"But the mirror told her, ""You are more than pretty--you are beautiful."" ",1202,1274
14,"One day the Queen was travelling through that part of the country, and had her little daughter, who was a princess, with her. ",1274,1400
15,"All the people, amongst them Karen too, streamed towards the castle, where the little princess, in fine white clothes, stood before the window and allowed herself to be stared at. ",1400,1580
16,"She wore neither a train nor a golden crown, but beautiful red morocco shoes; ",1580,1658
17, they were indeed much finer than those which the shoemaker's wife had sewn for little Karen. ,1657,1751
18,There is really nothing in the world that can be compared to red shoes! ,1751,1823
19,Karen was now old enough to be confirmed; ,1823,1865
20," she received some new clothes, and she was also to have some new shoes. ",1864,1937
21,"The rich shoemaker in the town took the measure of her little foot in his own room, in which there stood great glass cases full of pretty shoes and white slippers. ",1937,2101
22,"It all looked very lovely, but the old lady could not see very well, and therefore did not get much pleasure out of it. ",2101,2221
23,"Amongst the shoes stood a pair of red ones, like those which the princess had worn. ",2221,2305
24,How beautiful they were! ,2305,2330
25,"and the shoemaker said that they had been made for a count's daughter, but that they had not fitted her. ",2330,2435
26,"""I suppose they are of shiny leather?"" ",2435,2474
27,asked the old lady. ,2474,2494
28,"""They shine so."" ",2494,2511
29,"""Yes, they do shine,"" said Karen. ",2511,2545
30,"They fitted her, and were bought. ",2545,2579
31,"But the old lady knew nothing of their being red, for she would never have allowed Karen to be confirmed in red shoes, as she was now to be. ",2579,2720
32,"Everybody looked at her feet, and the whole of the way from the church door to the choir it seemed to her as if even the ancient figures on the monuments, in their stiff collars and long black robes, had their eyes fixed on her red shoes. ",2720,2959
33,"It was only of these that she thought when the clergyman laid his hand upon her head and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and told her that she was now to be a grown-up Christian. ",2959,3159
34,"The organ pealed forth solemnly, and the sweet children's voices mingled with that of their old leader; ",3159,3263
35, but Karen thought only of her red shoes. ,3262,3304
36,In the afternoon the old lady heard from everybody that Karen had worn red shoes. ,3304,3386
37,"She said that it was a shocking thing to do, that it was very improper, and that Karen was always to go to church in future in black shoes, even if they were old. ",3386,3549
38,On the following Sunday there was Communion. ,3549,3594
39,"Karen looked first at the black shoes, then at the red ones--looked at the red ones again, and put them on. ",3594,3702
40,"The sun was shining gloriously, so Karen and the old lady went along the footpath through the corn, where it was rather dusty. ",3702,3829
41,At the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning on a crutch; ,3829,3899
42," he had a wonderfully long beard, more red than white, and he bowed down to the ground and asked the old lady whether he might wipe her shoes. ",3898,4041
43,Then Karen put out her little foot too. ,4041,4081
44,"""Dear me, what pretty dancing-shoes!"" ",4081,4119
45,said the soldier. ,4119,4137
46,"""Sit fast, when you dance,"" said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand. ",4137,4234
47,The old lady gave the soldier some money and then went with Karen into the church. ,4234,4317
48,"And all the people inside looked at Karen's red shoes, and all the figures gazed at them; ",4317,4407
49," when Karen knelt before the altar and put the golden goblet to her mouth, she thought only of the red shoes. ",4406,4516
50,"It seemed to her as though they were swimming about in the goblet, and she forgot to sing the psalm, forgot to say the ""Lord's Prayer."" ",4516,4652
51,"Now every one came out of church, and the old lady stepped into her carriage. ",4652,4730
52,"But just as Karen was lifting up her foot to get in too, the old soldier said: ""Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!"" ",4730,4847
53,"and Karen could not help it, she was obliged to dance a few steps; ",4847,4914
54," and when she had once begun, her legs continued to dance. ",4913,4972
55,It seemed as if the shoes had got power over them. ,4972,5023
56,"She danced round the church corner, for she could not stop; ",5023,5083
57, the coachman had to run after her and seize her. ,5082,5132
58,"He lifted her into the carriage, but her feet continued to dance, so that she kicked the good old lady violently. ",5132,5246
59,"At last they took off her shoes, and her legs were at rest. ",5246,5306
60,"At home the shoes were put into the cupboard, but Karen could not help looking at them. ",5306,5394
61,"Now the old lady fell ill, and it was said that she would not rise from her bed again. ",5394,5481
62,"She had to be nursed and waited upon, and this was no one's duty more than Karen's. ",5481,5565
63,"But there was a grand ball in the town, and Karen was invited. ",5565,5628
64,"She looked at the red shoes, saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that; ",5628,5712
65," she put the red shoes on, thinking there was no harm in that either; ",5711,5781
66, and then she went to the ball; ,5780,5812
67, and commenced to dance. ,5811,5836
68,"But when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced down the room, down the stairs through the street, and out through the gates of the town. ",5836,6055
69,"She danced, and was obliged to dance, far out into the dark wood. ",6055,6121
70,"Suddenly something shone up among the trees, and she believed it was the moon, for it was a face. ",6121,6219
71,But it was the old soldier with the red beard; ,6219,6266
72," he sat there nodding his head and said: ""Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!"" ",6265,6344
73,"She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; ",6344,6404
74, but they stuck fast. ,6403,6425
75,"She tore off her stockings, but the shoes had grown fast to her feet. ",6425,6495
76,"She danced and was obliged to go on dancing over field and meadow, in rain and sunshine, by night and by day--but by night it was most horrible. ",6495,6640
77,She danced out into the open churchyard; ,6640,6681
78, but the dead there did not dance. ,6680,6715
79,They had something better to do than that. ,6715,6758
80,She wanted to sit down on the pauper's grave where the bitter fern grows; ,6758,6832
81, but for her there was neither peace nor rest. ,6831,6878
82,"And as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth; ",6878,7024
83," his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a broad shining sword. ",7023,7101
84,"""Dance you shall,"" said he, ""dance in your red shoes till you are pale and cold, till your skin shrivels up and you are a skeleton! ",7101,7233
85,"Dance you shall, from door to door, and where proud and wicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you and fear you! ",7233,7367
86,"Dance you shall, dance--!"" ",7367,7394
87,"""Mercy!"" ",7394,7403
88,cried Karen. ,7403,7416
89,"But she did not hear what the angel answered, for the shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, along highways and byways, and unceasingly she had to dance. ",7416,7583
90,One morning she danced past a door that she knew well; ,7583,7638
91," they were singing a psalm inside, and a coffin was being carried out covered with flowers. ",7637,7729
92,Then she knew that she was forsaken by every one and damned by the angel of God. ,7729,7810
93,"She danced, and was obliged to go on dancing through the dark night. ",7810,7879
94,The shoes bore her away over thorns and stumps till she was all torn and bleeding; ,7879,7962
95, she danced away over the heath to a lonely little house. ,7961,8019
96,"Here, she knew, lived the executioner; ",8019,8058
97," and she tapped with her finger at the window and said: ""Come out, come out! ",8057,8134
98,"I cannot come in, for I must dance."" ",8134,8171
99,"And the executioner said: ""I don't suppose you know who I am. ",8171,8233
100,"I strike off the heads of the wicked, and I notice that my axe is tingling to do so."" ",8233,8319
101,"""Don't cut off my head!"" ",8319,8344
102,"said Karen, ""for then I could not repent of my sin. ",8344,8396
103,"But cut off my feet with the red shoes."" ",8396,8437
104,"And then she confessed all her sin, and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes; ",8437,8533
105, but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep forest. ,8532,8619
106,"And he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches, and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners; ",8619,8734
107," she kissed the hand that guided the axe, and went away over the heath. ",8733,8805
108,"""Now, I have suffered enough for the red shoes,"" she said; ",8805,8864
109," ""I will go to church, so that people can see me."" ",8863,8914
110,And she went quickly up to the church-door; ,8914,8958
111," but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back. ",8957,9063
112,"During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: ""Now I have suffered and striven enough. ",9063,9203
113,"I believe I am quite as good as many of those who sit in church and give themselves airs."" ",9203,9294
114,And so she went boldly on; ,9294,9321
115, but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she saw the red shoes dancing along before her. ,9320,9427
116,"Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin. ",9427,9510
117,"She went to the parsonage, and begged that she might be taken into service there. ",9510,9592
118,"She would be industrious, she said, and do everything that she could; ",9592,9662
119," she did not mind about the wages as long as she had a roof over her, and was with good people. ",9661,9757
120,"The pastor's wife had pity on her, and took her into service. ",9757,9819
121,And she was industrious and thoughtful. ,9819,9859
122,She sat quiet and listened when the pastor read aloud from the Bible in the evening. ,9859,9944
123,"All the children liked her very much, but when they spoke about dress and grandeur and beauty she would shake her head. ",9944,10064
124,"On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; ",10064,10161
125," but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches. ",10160,10224
126,"And then the others went to hear God's Word, but she went alone into her little room; ",10224,10310
127, this was only large enough to hold the bed and a chair. ,10309,10366
128,"Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: ""O God! ",10366,10572
129,"help me!"" ",10572,10582
130,"Then the sun shone so brightly, and right before her stood an angel of God in white robes; ",10582,10673
131, it was the same one whom she had seen that night at the church-door. ,10672,10742
132,"He no longer carried the sharp sword, but a beautiful green branch, full of roses; ",10742,10825
133," with this he touched the ceiling, which rose up very high, and where he had touched it there shone a golden star. ",10824,10939
134,"He touched the walls, which opened wide apart, and she saw the organ which was pealing forth; ",10939,11033
135," she saw the pictures of the old pastors and their wives, and the congregation sitting in the polished chairs and singing from their hymn-books. ",11032,11177
136,"The church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow room, or the room had gone to the church. ",11177,11277
137,"She sat in the pew with the rest of the pastor's household, and when they had finished the hymn and looked up, they nodded and said, ""It was right of you to come, Karen."" ",11277,11448
138,"""It was mercy,"" said she. ",11448,11474
139,The organ played and the children's voices in the choir sounded soft and lovely. ,11474,11555
140,"The bright warm sunshine streamed through the window into the pew where Karen sat, and her heart became so filled with it, so filled with peace and joy, that it broke. ",11555,11723
141,"Her soul flew on the sunbeams to Heaven, and no one was there who asked after the Red Shoes.",11723,11816
