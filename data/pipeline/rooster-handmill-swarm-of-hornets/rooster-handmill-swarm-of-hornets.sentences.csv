0,Once upon a time there was a peasant who wanted to go to sell a pig. ,0,69
1,"After he had gone a while, he met a man who asked him where he was going with his pig. ",69,156
2,"""I want to sell it,"" answered the peasant, ""but I do not know what to do to get rid of it."" ",156,248
3,"""Go to the devil,"" said the man, ""he will be the first to rid you of it."" ",248,322
4,So the peasant kept on along the broad highway. ,322,370
5,"When he came to the devil's place, there stood a man out by the wood-pile making wood. ",370,457
6,The peasant went to him and asked whether he could tell him if they wanted to buy a pig in the devil's place. ,457,567
7,"""I'll go in and ask,"" said the man, ""if you will make wood in my stead while I am gone."" ",567,656
8,"""Yes, I will do that gladly,"" said the peasant, took the ax, stood at the wood-pile and began to make wood. ",656,764
9,And he worked and worked until evening came; ,764,809
10, but the man did not return to tell him whether they would or would not buy a pig in the devil's place. ,808,912
11,"At length another man came that way, and the peasant asked him whether he would make wood in his stead, for it was impossible to lay down the ax unless another took it up and went on working. ",912,1104
12,"So the man took the ax and stood there making wood, and the peasant went into the devil's place himself, and asked whether any one wanted to buy a pig. ",1104,1256
13,"A crowd as large as that at a fair at once gathered, and all wanted to buy the pig. ",1256,1340
14,"Then the peasant thought: ""Whoever pays the most, gets it."" ",1340,1400
15,"And one would overbid another, offering far more than a whole herd of pigs were worth. ",1400,1487
16,"But at last a gentleman came along who whispered something to the peasant, and told him to come along with him; ",1487,1599
17, and he could have all the money he wanted. ,1598,1642
18,"So when they had reached the gentleman's house, and the peasant had given him the pig, he received in payment a rooster who would lay silver coins as often as he was told to do so. ",1642,1823
19,"Then the peasant went his way, well content with his bargain. ",1823,1885
20,But on the way home he stayed overnight at a tavern kept by an old woman. ,1885,1959
21,"And he was so exceedingly happy about his splendid rooster, that he had to boast about him to the old woman, and show her how he went about laying silver coins. ",1959,2120
22,"And at night, when the peasant was fast asleep, the old woman came and took away his rooster, and put another in its place. ",2120,2244
23,No sooner did the peasant awake in the morning than he wanted to set his rooster to work. ,2244,2334
24,"""Lay quickly, rooster of mine! ",2334,2365
25,"Lay big silver coins, my rooster!"" ",2365,2400
26,"But the rooster could lay no silver coins at all, and only answered ""Kikeriki! ",2400,2479
27,Kikeriki! ,2469,2479
28,"Kikeriki!"" ",2489,2500
29,"Then the peasant fell into a rage, wandered back to the devil's place, complained about the rooster, and told how absolutely worthless he was. ",2500,2643
30,"He was kindly received, and the same gentleman gave him a hand-mill. ",2643,2712
31,"When he called out ""Mill grind!"" ",2712,2745
32,"to it, it would grind as much meal as he wanted it to, and would not stop until he said: ""Mill, stop grinding!"" ",2745,2857
33,And the mill would grind out every kind of meal for which he asked. ,2857,2925
34,"When the peasant set out for home, he reached the same tavern at which he had already put up in the evening, so he turned in and decided to stay over night. ",2925,3082
35,He was so pleased with the mill that it was impossible for him to hold his tongue; ,3082,3165
36," so he told the old woman what a valuable mill he had, and showed her how it worked. ",3164,3249
37,"But during the night, while he was asleep, the old woman came and stole his mill and put another in its place. ",3249,3360
38,"When the peasant awoke in the morning, he was in a great hurry to test his mill; ",3360,3441
39, but he could not make it obey. ,3440,3472
40,"""Mill grind!"" ",2731,2745
41,he cried. ,3486,3496
42,But the mill stood still. ,3496,3522
43,"Then he said: ""Dear mill, grind wheat meal!"" ",3522,3567
44,but it had no effect. ,3567,3589
45,"""Then grind rye meal!"" ",3589,3612
46,he shouted; ,3612,3624
47," but that did not help, either. ",3623,3655
48,"""Well, then, grind peas!"" ",3655,3681
49,But the mill did not seem to hear; ,3681,3716
50, but stood as still as though it had never turned a single time in all its life. ,3715,3796
51,"Then the peasant took the road back to the devil's place again, and at once hunted up the gentleman who had purchased his pig, and told him the mill would grind no more meal. ",3796,3971
52,"""Do not grieve about that,"" said the gentleman, and gave him a large, large hornets' nest, full of hornets, who flew out in swarms and stung any one whom they were told to sting, until one said ""stop!"" ",3971,4173
53,to them. ,4173,4182
54,"Now when the peasant again came to the old woman, he told her he had a swarm of hornets who obeyed his commands. ",4182,4295
55,"""Heavens above!"" ",4295,4312
56,"cried the woman, ""that's something worth while seeing!"" ",4312,4368
57,"""You may see it without any trouble,"" replied the peasant, and at once called: ""Out, out, my hornets and sting the old woman!"" ",4368,4495
58,"And at once the entire swarm fell upon the old woman, who began to scream pitifully. ",4495,4580
59,"She begged the peasant to please call back his hornets, and said she was only too willing to give back the rooster and the mill she had taken. ",4580,4723
60,The peasant did not object to this; ,4723,4759
61," but ordered his hornets to leave the old woman alone, and fly back into their house. ",4758,4844
62,"Then he went home with his rooster, his mill and his hornets, became a rich man and lived happily until he died. ",4844,4957
63,"And he was in the habit of saying: ""They have a big fair in the devil's place, and you find real decent people there, and above all, a liberal gentleman, with whom it is a pleasure to do business.""",4957,5155
