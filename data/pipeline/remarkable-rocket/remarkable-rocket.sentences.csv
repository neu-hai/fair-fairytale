0,"The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. ",0,74
1,"He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived. ",74,145
2,"She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer. ",145,248
3,"The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself. ",248,358
4,"Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived. ",358,527
5,So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered. ,527,606
6,"""She is like a white rose!"" ",606,634
7,"they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies. ",634,701
8,At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her. ,701,766
9,"He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold. ",766,826
10,"When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand. ",826,886
11,"""Your picture was beautiful,"" he murmured, ""but you are more beautiful than your picture"";",886,976
12, and the little Princess blushed. ,976,1010
13,"""She was like a white rose before,"" said a young Page to his neighbour, ""but she is like a red rose now"";",1010,1115
14, and the whole Court was delighted. ,1115,1151
15,"For the next three days everybody went about saying, ""White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose"";",1151,1249
16, and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled. ,1249,1317
17,"As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette. ",1317,1465
18,When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated. ,1465,1524
19,"It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls. ",1524,1668
20,"Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours. ",1668,1729
21,The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal. ,1729,1827
22,"Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy. ",1827,1937
23,"""It's quite clear that they love each other,"" said the little Page, ""as clear as crystal!"" ",1937,2028
24,and the King doubled his salary a second time. ,2028,2075
25,"""What an honour!"" ",2075,2093
26,cried all the courtiers. ,2093,2118
27,After the banquet there was to be a Ball. ,2118,2160
28,"The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute. ",2160,2269
29,"He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King. ",2269,2358
30,"Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; ",2358,2443
31," but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, ""Charming! ",2442,2520
32,"charming!"" ",2520,2531
33,"The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight. ",2531,2631
34,"The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage. ",2631,2799
35,"What are fireworks like?"" ",2799,2825
36,"she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace. ",2825,2899
37,"""They are like the Aurora Borealis,"" said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, ""only much more natural. ",2899,3043
38,"I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing. ",3043,3176
39,"You must certainly see them."" ",3176,3206
40,"So at the end of the King's garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other. ",3206,3393
41,"""The world is certainly very beautiful,"" cried a little Squib. ",3393,3456
42,"""Just look at those yellow tulips. ",3456,3491
43,Why! ,3491,3496
44,if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier. ,3496,3551
45,I am very glad I have travelled. ,3551,3584
46,"Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one's prejudices."" ",3584,3664
47,"""The King's garden is not the world, you foolish squib,"" said a big Roman Candle; ",3664,3746
48," ""the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly."" ",3745,3835
49,"""Any place you love is the world to you,"" exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; ",3835,4010
50," ""but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it. ",4009,4075
51,"They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised. ",4075,4154
52,"True love suffers, and is silent. ",4154,4188
53,I remember myself once-But it is no matter now. ,4188,4236
54,"Romance is a thing of the past."" ",4236,4269
55,"""Nonsense!"" ",4269,4281
56,"said the Roman Candle, ""Romance never dies. ",4281,4325
57,"It is like the moon, and lives for ever. ",4325,4366
58,"The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly. ",4366,4435
59,"I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news."" ",4435,4591
60,But the Catherine Wheel shook her head. ,4591,4631
61,"""Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,"" she murmured. ",4631,4698
62,"She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end. ",4698,4830
63,"Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round. ",4830,4897
64,"It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end of a long stick. ",4897,4988
65,"He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention. ",4988,5066
66,"""Ahem! ",5066,5073
67,"ahem!"" ",5073,5080
68,"he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, ""Romance is dead."" ",5080,5211
69,"""Order! ",5211,5219
70,"order!"" ",5219,5227
71,cried out a Cracker. ,5227,5248
72,"He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use. ",5248,5400
73,"""Quite dead,"" whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep. ",5400,5472
74,"As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began. ",5472,5553
75,"He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking. ",5553,5706
76,"In fact, he had a most distinguished manner. ",5706,5751
77,"""How fortunate it is for the King's son,"" he remarked, ""that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off. ",5751,5877
78,"Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; ",5877,5966
79," but, Princes are always lucky."" ",5965,5998
80,"""Dear me!"" ",5998,6009
81,"said the little Squib, ""I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour."" ",6009,6127
82,"""It may be so with you,"" he answered; ",6127,6165
83," ""indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different. ",6164,6231
84,"I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents. ",6231,6294
85,"My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing. ",6294,6399
86,"When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars. ",6399,6563
87,"She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder. ",6563,6643
88,"My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction. ",6643,6705
89,He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again. ,6705,6786
90,"He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain. ",6786,6903
91,The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms. ,6903,6972
92,"Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art. ",6972,7039
93,"""Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,"" said a Bengal Light; ",7039,7098
94," ""I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister."" ",7097,7167
95,"""Well, I said Pylotechnic,"" answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance. ",7167,7394
96,"""I was saying,"" continued the Rocket, ""I was saying-What was I saying?"" ",7394,7466
97,"""You were talking about yourself,"" replied the Roman Candle. ",7466,7527
98,"""Of course; ",7527,7539
99, I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted. ,7538,7622

101,"No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that."" ",7699,7776
102,"""What is a sensitive person?"" ",7776,7806
103,said the Cracker to the Roman Candle. ,7806,7844
104,"""A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes,"" answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; ",7844,7972
105, and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter. ,7971,8019
106,"""Pray, what are you laughing at?"" ",8019,8053
107,inquired the Rocket; ,8053,8074
108," ""I am not laughing."" ",8073,8095
109,"""I am laughing because I am happy,"" replied the Cracker. ",8095,8152
110,"""That is a very selfish reason,"" said the Rocket angrily. ",8152,8210
111,"""What right have you to be happy? ",8210,8244
112,You should be thinking about others. ,8244,8281
113,"In fact, you should be thinking about me. ",8281,8323
114,"I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same. ",8323,8402
115,That is what is called sympathy. ,8402,8435
116,"It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree. ",8435,8496
117,"Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one! ",8496,8600
118,"The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; ",8600,8695
119," and as for the King, I know he would not get over it. ",8694,8749
120,"Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears."" ",8749,8844
121,"""If you want to give pleasure to others,"" cried the Roman Candle, ""you had better keep yourself dry."" ",8844,8946
122,"""Certainly,"" exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits; ",8946,9018
123," ""that is only common sense."" ",9017,9047
124,"""Common sense, indeed!"" ",9047,9071
125,said the Rocket indignantly; ,9071,9100
126," ""you forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable. ",9099,9158
127,"Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination. ",9158,9234
128,"But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; ",9234,9306
129, I always think of them as being quite different. ,9305,9355
130,"As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature. ",9355,9460
131,"Fortunately for myself, I don't care. ",9460,9498
132,"The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated. ",9498,9664
133,But none of you have any hearts. ,9664,9697
134,"Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married."" ",9697,9799
135,"""Well, really,"" exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, ""why not? ",9799,9857
136,"It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it. ",9857,9960
137,"You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride."" ",9960,10031
138,"""Ah! ",10031,10036
139,"what a trivial view of life!"" ",10036,10066

141," ""but it is only what I expected. ",10082,10116
142,There is nothing in you; ,10116,10141
143, you are hollow and empty. ,10140,10167
144,"Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; ",10167,10368
145, and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; ,10367,10427
146, and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; ,10426,10491
147, and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned. ,10490,10563
148,What a terrible misfortune! ,10563,10591
149,"Poor people, to lose their only son! ",10591,10628
150,It is really too dreadful! ,10628,10655
151,"I shall never get over it."" ",10655,10683

153," ""no misfortune has happened to them at all."" ",10746,10792
154,"""I never said that they had,"" replied the Rocket; ",10792,10842
155," ""I said that they might. ",10841,10867
156,If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter. ,10867,10963
157,I hate people who cry over spilt milk. ,10963,11002
158,"But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected."" ",11002,11092
159,"""You certainly are!"" ",11092,11113

161,"""In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met."" ",11137,11193
162,"""You are the rudest person I ever met,"" said the Rocket, ""and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."" ",11193,11308
163,"""Why, you don't even know him,"" growled the Roman Candle. ",11308,11366
164,"""I never said I knew him,"" answered the Rocket. ",11366,11414
165,"""I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all. ",11414,11480
166,"It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends."" ",11480,11533
167,"""You had really better keep yourself dry,"" said the Fire-balloon. ",11533,11599
168,"""That is the important thing."" ",11599,11630
169,"""Very important for you, I have no doubt,"" answered the Rocket, ""but I shall weep if I choose"";",11630,11725
170," and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in. ",11725,11951
171,"""He must have a truly romantic nature,"" said the Catherine Wheel, ""for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about"";",11951,12075
172," and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box. ",12075,12136
173,"But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, ""Humbug! ",12136,12226
174,"humbug!"" ",12226,12235
175,at the top of their voices. ,12235,12263
176,"They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug. ",12263,12356
177,Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; ,12356,12407
178," and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace. ",12406,12480
179,The Prince and Princess were leading the dance. ,12480,12528
180,"They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time. ",12528,12684
181,"Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist. ",12684,12859
182,"""Let the fireworks begin,"" said the King; ",12859,12901
183," and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden. ",12900,12987
184,"He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole. ",12987,13083
185,It was certainly a magnificent display. ,13083,13123
186,Whizz! ,13123,13130
187,Whizz! ,13123,13130

195,Bang! ,13404,13410
196,"answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely. ",13416,13479
197,Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket. ,13479,13539
198,He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all. ,13539,13599
199,"The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use. ",13599,13694
200,"All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire. ",13694,13843
201,Huzza! ,13843,13850
202,Huzza! ,13843,13850
203,cried the Court; ,13857,13874
204, and the little Princess laughed with pleasure. ,13873,13921
205,"""I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,"" said the Rocket; ",13921,13997
206," ""no doubt that is what it means,"" and he looked more supercilious than ever. ",13996,14074
207,The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy. ,14074,14128
208,"""This is evidently a deputation,"" said the Rocket; ",14128,14179
209," ""I will receive them with becoming dignity"" so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject. ",14178,14340
210,But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away. ,14340,14410
211,Then one of them caught sight of him. ,14410,14448
212,"""Hallo!"" ",14448,14457
213,"he cried, ""what a bad rocket!"" ",14457,14488
214,and he threw him over the wall into the ditch. ,14488,14535
215,"""Bad Rocket? ",14535,14548

218," ""impossible! ",14600,14614
219,"Grand Rocket, that is what the man said. ",14614,14655
220,"Bad and Grand sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same"";",14655,14727
221, and he fell into the mud. ,14727,14754
222,"""It is not comfortable here,"" he remarked, ""but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health. ",14754,14899
223,"My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."" ",14899,14965
224,"Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him. ",14965,15054
225,"""A new arrival, I see!"" ",15054,15078

253,"""Conversation, indeed!"" ",16372,16396
254,said the Rocket. ,16396,16413
255,"""You have talked the whole time yourself. ",16413,16455
256,"That is not conversation."" ",16455,16482
257,"""Somebody must listen,"" answered the Frog, ""and I like to do all the talking myself. ",16482,16567
258,"It saves time, and prevents arguments."" ",16567,16607
259,"""But I like arguments,"" said the Rocket. ",16607,16648
260,"""I hope not,"" said the Frog complacently. ",16648,16690
261,"""Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions. ",16690,16786
262,Good-bye a second time; ,16786,16810
263, I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away. ,16809,16876
264,"""You are a very irritating person,"" said the Rocket, ""and very ill-bred. ",16876,16949
265,"I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do. ",16949,17048
266,"It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature. ",17048,17211
267,"In fact, you should take example by me; ",17211,17251
268, you could not possibly have a better model. ,17250,17295
269,"Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately. ",17295,17410
270,I am a great favourite at Court; ,17410,17443
271," in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour. ",17442,17513
272,"Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial."" ",17513,17585
273,"""There is no good talking to him,"" said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; ",17585,17692
274," ""no good at all, for he has gone away."" ",17691,17732
275,"""Well, that is his loss, not mine,"" answered the Rocket. ",17732,17789
276,"""I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention. ",17789,17865
277,I like hearing myself talk. ,17865,17893
278,It is one of my greatest pleasures. ,17893,17929
279,"I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying."" ",17929,18065
280,"""Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,"" said the Dragon-fly; ",18065,18137
281, and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky. ,18136,18210
282,"""How very silly of him not to stay here!"" ",18210,18252
283,said the Rocket. ,16396,16413
284,"""I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind. ",18269,18343

286,"Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day"";",18372,18425
287, and he sank down a little deeper into the mud. ,18425,18473
288,After some time a large White Duck swam up to him. ,18473,18524
289,"She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle. ",18524,18622
290,"""Quack, quack, quack,"" she said. ",18622,18655
291,"""What a curious shape you are! ",18655,18686
292,"May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?"" ",18686,18758
293,"""It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,"" answered the Rocket, ""otherwise you would know who I am. ",18758,18880
294,"However, I excuse your ignorance. ",18880,18914
295,It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself. ,18914,18988
296,"You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain."" ",18988,19102
297,"""I don't think much of that,"" said the Duck, ""as I cannot see what use it is to any one. ",19102,19191
298,"Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something."" ",19191,19342
299,"""My good creature,"" cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, ""I see that you belong to the lower orders. ",19342,19456
300,A person of my position is never useful. ,19456,19497
301,"We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient. ",19497,19564
302,"I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend. ",19564,19677
303,"Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do."" ",19677,19795
304,"""Well, well,"" said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, ""everybody has different tastes. ",19795,19933
305,"I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here."" ",19933,20006
306,"""Oh! ",20006,20011

308,"""I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor. ",20039,20088

310,"There is neither society here, nor solitude. ",20139,20184
311,"In fact, it is essentially suburban. ",20184,20221
312,"I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world."" ",20221,20321
313,"""I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,"" remarked the Duck; ",20321,20394
314," ""there are so many things that need reforming. ",20393,20441
315,"Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like. ",20441,20564
316,"However, they did not seem to have much effect. ",20564,20612
317,"Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family."" ",20612,20668
318,"""I am made for public life,"" said the Rocket, ""and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them. ",20668,20771
319,Whenever we appear we excite great attention. ,20771,20817
320,"I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight. ",20817,20903
321,"As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one's mind from higher things."" ",20903,20990
322,"""Ah! ",10031,10036
323,"the higher things of life, how fine they are!"" ",20995,21042

325," ""and that reminds me how hungry I feel"": and she swam away down the stream, saying, ""Quack, quack, quack."" ",21056,21164

329, but the Duck paid no attention to him. ,21245,21285
330,"""I am glad that she has gone,"" he said to himself, ""she has a decidedly middle-class mind"";",21285,21376
331," and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some sticks. ",21376,21581
332,"""This must be the deputation,"" said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified. ",21581,21666
333,"""Hallo!"" ",14448,14457
334,"cried one of the boys, ""look at this old stick! ",21675,21723
335,"I wonder how it came here"";",21723,21750
336, and he picked the rocket out of the ditch. ,21750,21794
337,"""Old Stick!"" ",21794,21807
338,"said the Rocket, ""impossible! ",21807,21837
339,"Gold Stick, that is what he said. ",21837,21871
340,Gold Stick is very complimentary. ,21871,21905

342,"""Let us put it into the fire!"" ",21964,21995
343,"said the other boy, ""it will help to boil the kettle."" ",21995,22050
344,"So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire. ",22050,22131
345,"""This is magnificent,"" cried the Rocket, ""they are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me."" ",22131,22253
346,"""We will go to sleep now,"" they said, ""and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled"";",22253,22339
347," and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes. ",22339,22393
348,"The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn. ",22393,22451
349,"At last, however, the fire caught him. ",22451,22490
