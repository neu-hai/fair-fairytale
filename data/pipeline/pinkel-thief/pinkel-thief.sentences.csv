0,"Long, long ago there lived a widow who had three sons. ",0,55
1,"The two eldest were grown up, and though they were known to be idle fellows, some of the neighbours had given them work to do on account of the respect in which their mother was held. ",55,239
2,But at the time this story begins they had both been so careless and idle that their masters declared they would keep them no longer. ,239,373
3,"So home they went to their mother and youngest brother, of whom they thought little, because he made himself useful about the house, and looked after the hens, and milked the cow. ",373,553
4,"'Pinkel,' they called him in scorn, and by-and-by 'Pinkel' became his name throughout the village. ",553,652
5,"The two young men thought it was much nicer to live at home and be idle than to be obliged to do a quantity of disagreeable things they did not like, and they would have stayed by the fire till the end of their lives had not the widow lost patience with them and said that since they would not look for work at home they must seek it elsewhere, for she would not have them under her roof any longer. ",652,1052
6,"But she repented bitterly of her words when Pinkel told her that he too was old enough to go out into the world, and that when he had made a fortune he would send for his mother to keep house for him. ",1052,1253
7,"The widow wept many tears at parting from her youngest son, but as she saw that his heart was set upon going with his brothers, she did not try to keep him. ",1253,1410
8,"So the young men started off one morning in high spirits, never doubting that work such as they might be willing to do would be had for the asking, as soon as their little store of money was spent. ",1410,1608
9,But a very few days of wandering opened their eyes. ,1608,1660
10,"Nobody seemed to want them, or, if they did, the young men declared that they were not able to undertake all that the farmers or millers or woodcutters required of them. ",1660,1830
11,"The youngest brother, who was wiser, would gladly have done some of the work that the others refused, but he was small and slight, and no one thought of offering him any. ",1830,2001
12,"Therefore they went from one place to another, living only on the fruit and nuts they could find in the woods, and getting hungrier every day. ",2001,2144
13,"One night, after they had been walking for many hours and were very tired, they came to a large lake with an island in the middle of it. ",2144,2281
14,"From the island streamed a strong light, by which they could see everything almost as clearly as if the sun had been shining, and they perceived that, lying half hidden in the rushes, was a boat. ",2281,2477
15,"'Let us take it and row over to the island, where there must be a house,' said the eldest brother; ",2477,2576
16, 'and perhaps they will give us food and shelter.' ,2575,2626
17,And they all got in and rowed across in the direction of the light. ,2626,2694
18,"As they drew near the island they saw that it came from a golden lantern hanging over the door of a hut, while sweet tinkling music proceeded from some bells attached to the golden horns of a goat which was feeding near the cottage. ",2694,2927
19,"The young men's hearts rejoiced as they thought that at last they would be able to rest their weary limbs, and they entered the hut, but were amazed to see an ugly old woman inside, wrapped in a cloak of gold which lighted up the whole house. ",2927,3170
20,"They looked at each other uneasily as she came forward with her daughter, as they knew by the cloak that this was a famous witch. ",3170,3300
21,'What do you want?' ,3300,3320
22,"asked she, at the same time signing to her daughter to stir the large pot on the fire. ",3320,3407
23,"'We are tired and hungry, and would fain have shelter for the night,' answered the eldest brother. ",3407,3506
24,"'You cannot get it here,' said the witch, 'but you will find both food and shelter in the palace on the other side of the lake. ",3506,3634
25,Take your boat and go; ,3634,3657
26," but leave this boy with me-I can find work for him, though something tells me he is quick and cunning, and will do me ill.' 'What harm can a poor boy like me do a great Troll like you?' ",3656,3843
27,answered Pinkel. ,3843,3860
28,"'Let me go, I pray you, with my brothers. ",3860,3902
29,I will promise never to hurt you.' ,3902,3937
30,"And at last the witch let him go, and he followed his brothers to the boat. ",3937,4013
31,"The way was further than they thought, and it was morning before they reached the palace. ",4013,4103
32,"Now, at last, their luck seemed to have turned, for while the two eldest were given places in the king's stables, Pinkel was taken as page to the little prince. ",4103,4264
33,"He was a clever and amusing boy, who saw everything that passed under his eyes, and the king noticed this, and often employed him in his own service, which made his brothers very jealous. ",4264,4452
34,"Things went on this way for some time, and Pinkel every day rose in the royal favour. ",4452,4538
35,"At length the envy of his brothers became so great that they could bear it no longer, and consulted together how best they might ruin his credit with the king. ",4538,4698
36,"They did not wish to kill him-though, perhaps, they would not have been sorry if they had heard he was dead-but merely wished to remind him that he was after all only a child, not half so old and wise as they. ",4698,4908
37,Their opportunity soon came. ,4908,4937
38,"It happened to be the king's custom to visit his stables once a week, so that he might see that his horses were being properly cared for. ",4937,5075
39,"The next time he entered the stables the two brothers managed to be in the way, and when the king praised the beautiful satin skins of the horses under their charge, and remarked how different was their condition when his grooms had first come across the lake, the young men at once began to speak of the wonderful light which sprang from the lantern over the hut. ",5075,5440
40,"The king, who had a passion for collection all the rarest things he could find, fell into the trap directly, and inquired where he could get this marvellous lantern. ",5440,5606
41,"'Send Pinkel for it, Sire,' said they. ",5606,5645
42,"'It belongs to an old witch, who no doubt came by it in some evil way. ",5645,5716
43,"But Pinkel has a smooth tongue, and he can get the better of any woman, old or young.' ",5716,5803
44,"'Then bid him go this very night,' cried the king; ",5803,5854
45, 'and if he brings me the lantern I will make him one of the chief men about my person.' ,5853,5942
46,"Pinkel was much pleased at the thought of his adventure, and without more ado he borrowed a little boat which lay moored to the shore, and rowed over to the island at once. ",5942,6115
47,"It was late by the time he arrived, and almost dark, but he knew by the savoury smell that reached him that the witch was cooking her supper. ",6115,6257
48,"So he climbed softly on to the roof, and, peering, watched till the old woman's back was turned, when he quickly drew a handful of salt from his pocket and threw it into the pot. ",6257,6436
49,"Scarcely had he done this when the witch called her daughter and bade her lift the pot off the fire and put the stew into a dish, as it had been cooking quite long enough and she was hungry. ",6436,6627
50,"But no sooner had she tasted it than she put her spoon down, and declared that her daughter must have been meddling with it, for it was impossible to eat anything that was all made of salt. ",6627,6817
51,"'Go down to the spring in the valley, and get some fresh water, that I may prepare a fresh supper,' cried she, 'for I feel half-starved.' ",6817,6955
52,"'But, mother,' answered the girl, 'how can I find the well in this darkness? ",6955,7032
53,For you know that the lantern's rays shed no light down there.' ,7032,7096
54,"'Well, then, take the lantern with you,' answered the witch, 'for supper I must have, and there is no water that is nearer.' ",7096,7221
55,"So the girl took her pail in one hand and the golden lantern in the other, and hastened away to the well, followed by Pinkel, who took care to keep out of the way of the rays. ",7221,7397
56,"When at last she stooped to fill her pail at the well Pinkel pushed her into it, and snatching up the lantern hurried back to his boat and rowed off from the shore. ",7397,7562
57,"He was already a long distance from the island when the witch, who wondered what had become of her daughter, went to the door to look for her. ",7562,7705
58,"Close around the hut was thick darkness, but what was that bobbing light that streamed across the water? ",7705,7810
59,The witch's heart sank as all at once it flashed upon her what had happened. ,7810,7887
60,"'Is that you, Pinkel?' ",7887,7910
61,cried she; ,7910,7921
62," and the youth answered: 'Yes, dear mother, it is I!' ",7920,7974
63,'And are you not a knave for robbing me?' ,7974,8016
64,said she. ,8016,8026
65,"'Truly, dear mother, I am,' replied Pinkel, rowing faster than ever, for he was half afraid that the witch might come after him. ",8026,8155
66,"But she had no power on the water, and turned angrily into the hut, muttering to herself all the while: 'Take care! ",8155,8271
67,take care! ,8271,8282
68,A second time you will not escape so easily!' ,8282,8328
69,"The sun had not yet risen when Pinkel returned to the palace, and, entering the king's chamber, he held up the lantern so that its rays might fall upon the bed. ",8328,8489
70,"In an instant the king awoke, and seeing the golden lantern shedding its light upon him, he sprang up, and embraced Pinkel with joy. ",8489,8622
71,"'O cunning one,' cried he, 'what treasure hast thou brought me!' ",8622,8687
72,"And calling for his attendants he ordered that rooms next his own should be prepared for Pinkel, and that the youth might enter his presence at any hour. ",8687,8841
73,"And besides this, he was to have a seat on the council. ",8841,8897
74,It may easily be guessed that all this made the brothers more envious than they were before; ,8897,8990
75, and they cast about in their minds afresh how best they might destroy him. ,8989,9065
76,"At length they remembered the goat with golden horns and the bells, and they rejoiced; ",9065,9152
77," 'For,' said they, 'THIS time the old woman will be on the watch, and let him be as clever as he likes, the bells on the horns are sure to warn her.' ",9151,9301
78,"So when, as before, the king came down to the stables and praised the cleverness of their brother, the young men told him of that other marvel possessed by the witch, the goat with the golden horns. ",9301,9500
79,From this moment the king never closed his eyes at night for longing after this wonderful creature. ,9500,9600
80,"He understood something of the danger that there might be in trying to steal it, now that the witch's suspicions were aroused, and he spent hours in making plans for outwitting her. ",9600,9782
81,"But somehow he never could think of anything that would do, and at last, as the brothers had foreseen, he sent for Pinkel. ",9782,9905
82,"'I hear,' he said, 'that the old witch on the island has a goat with golden horns from which hang bells that tinkle the sweetest music. ",9905,10041
83,That goat I must have! ,10041,10064
84,"But, tell me, how am I to get it? ",10064,10098
85,I would give the third part of my kingdom to anyone who would bring it to me.' ,10098,10177
86,"'I will fetch it myself,' answered Pinkel. ",10177,10220
87,"This time it was easier for Pinkel to approach the island unseen, as there was no golden lantern to thrown its beams over the water. ",10220,10353
88,"But, on the other hand, the goat slept inside the hut, and would therefore have to be taken from under the very eyes of the old woman. ",10353,10488
89,How was he to do it? ,10488,10509
90,"All the way across the lake he thought and thought, till at length a plan came into his head which seemed as if it might do, though he knew it would be very difficult to carry out. ",10509,10690
91,"The first thing he did when he reached the shore was to look about for a piece of wood, and when he had found it he hid himself close to the hut, till it grew quite dark and near the hour when the witch and her daughter went to bed. ",10690,10923
92,"Then he crept up and fixed the wood under the door, which opened outwards, in such a manner that the more you tried to shut it the more firmly it stuck. ",10923,11076
93,And this was what happened when the girl went as usual to bolt the door and make all fast for the night. ,11076,11181
94,'What are you doing?' ,11181,11203
95,"asked the witch, as her daughter kept tugging at the handle. ",11203,11264
96,'There is something the matter with the door; ,11264,11310
97," it won't shut,' answered she. ",11309,11340
98,"'Well, leave it alone; ",11340,11363
99," there is nobody to hurt us,' said the witch, who was very sleepy; ",11362,11429
100," and the girl did as she was bid, and went to bed. ",11428,11479
101,"Very soon they both might have been heard snoring, and Pinkel knew that his time was come. ",11479,11570
102,"Slipping off his shoes he stole into the hut on tiptoe, and taking from his pocket some food of which the goat was particularly fond, he laid it under his nose. ",11570,11731
103,"Then, while the animal was eating it, he stuffed each golden bell with wool which he had also brought with him, stopping every minute to listen, lest the witch should awaken, and he should find himself changed into some dreadful bird or beast. ",11731,11975
104,"But the snoring still continued, and he went on with his work as quickly as he could. ",11975,12061
105,"When the last bell was done he drew another handful of food out of his pocket, and held it out to the goat, which instantly rose to its feet and followed Pinkel, who backed slowly to the door, and directly he got outside he seized the goat in his arms and ran down to the place where he had moored his boat. ",12061,12369
106,"As soon as he had reached the middle of the lake, Pinkel took the wool out of the bells, which began to tinkle loudly. ",12369,12488
107,"Their sound awoke the witch, who cried out as before: 'Is that you, Pinkel?' ",12488,12565
108,"'Yes, dear mother, it is I,' said Pinkel. ",12565,12607
109,'Have you stolen my golden goat?' ,12607,12641
110,asked she. ,12641,12652
111,"'Yes, dear mother, I have,' answered Pinkel. ",12652,12697
112,"'Are you not a knave, Pinkel?' ",12697,12728
113,"'Yes, dear mother, I am,' he replied. ",12728,12766
114,And the old witch shouted in a rage: 'Ah! ,12766,12808
115,"beware how you come hither again, for next time you shall not escape me!' ",12808,12882
116,But Pinkel laughed and rowed on. ,12882,12915
117,"The king was so delighted with the goat that he always kept it by his side, night and day; ",12915,13006
118," and, as he had promised, Pinkel was made ruler over the third part of the kingdom. ",13005,13089
119,"As may be supposed, the brothers were more furious than ever, and grew quite thin with rage. ",13089,13182
120,'How can we get rid of him?' ,13182,13211
121,said one to the other. ,13211,13234
122,And at length they remembered the golden cloak. ,13234,13282
123,'He will need to be clever if he is to steal that!' ,13282,13334
124,"they cried, with a chuckle. ",13334,13362
125,"And when next the king came to see his horses they began to speak of Pinkel and his marvellous cunning, and how he had contrived to steal the lantern and the goat, which nobody else would have been able to do. ",13362,13572
126,"'But as he was there, it is a pity he could not have brought away the golden cloak,' added they. ",13572,13669
127,'The golden cloak! ,13669,13688
128,what is that?' ,13688,13703
129,asked the king. ,13703,13719
130,And the young men described its beauties in such glowing words that the king declared he should never know a day's happiness till he had wrapped the cloak round his own shoulders. ,13719,13899
131,"'And,' added he, 'the man who brings it to me shall wed my daughter, and shall inherit my throne.' ",13899,13998
132,"'None can get it save Pinkel,' said they; ",13998,14040
133," for they did not imagine that the witch, after two warnings, could allow their brother to escape a third time. ",14039,14151
134,"So Pinkel was sent for, and with a glad heart he set out. ",14151,14209
135,"He passed many hours inventing first one plan and then another, till he had a scheme ready which he thought might prove successful. ",14209,14341
136,"Thrusting a large bag inside his coat, he pushed off from the shore, taking care this time to reach the island in daylight. ",14341,14465
137,"Having made his boat fast to a tree, he walked up to the hut, hanging his head, and putting on a face that was both sorrowful and ashamed. ",14465,14604
138,"'Is that you, Pinkel?' ",7887,7910
139,"asked the witch when she saw him, her eyes gleaming savagely. ",14627,14689
140,"'Yes, dear mother, it is I,' answered Pinkel. ",14689,14735
141,"'So you have dared, after all you have done, to put yourself in my power!' ",14735,14810
142,cried she. ,14810,14821
143,"'Well, you sha'n't escape me THIS time!' ",14821,14862
144,And she took down a large knife and began to sharpen it. ,14862,14919
145,'Oh! ,14919,14924
146,"dear mother, spare me!' ",14924,14948
147,"shrieked Pinkel, falling on his knees, and looking wildly about him. ",14948,15017
148,"'Spare you, indeed, you thief! ",15017,15048
149,Where are my lantern and my goat? ,15048,15082
150,No! ,15082,15086
151,not! ,15086,15091
152,there is only one fate for robbers!' ,15091,15128
153,And she brandished the knife in the air so that it glittered in the firelight. ,15128,15207
154,"'Then, if I must die,' said Pinkel, who, by this time, was getting really rather frightened, 'let me at least choose the manner of my death. ",15207,15348
155,"I am very hungry, for I have had nothing to eat all day. ",15348,15405
156,"Put some poison, if you like, into the porridge, but at least let me have a good meal before I die.' ",15405,15506
157,"'That is not a bad idea,' answered the woman; ",15506,15552
158," 'as long as you do die, it is all one to me.' ",15551,15598
159,"And ladling out a large bowl of porridge, she stirred some poisonous herbs into it, and set about work that had to be done. ",15598,15722
160,"Then Pinkel hastily poured all the contents of the bowl into his bag, and make a great noise with his spoon, as if he was scraping up the last morsel. ",15722,15873
161,"'Poisoned or not, the porridge is excellent. ",15873,15918
162,"I have eaten it, every scrap; ",15918,15948
163," do give me some more,' said Pinkel, turning towards her. ",15947,16005
164,"'Well, you have a fine appetite, young man,' answered the witch; ",16005,16070
165," 'however, it is the last time you will ever eat it, so I will give you another bowlful.' ",16069,16159
166,"And rubbing in the poisonous herbs, she poured him out half of what remained, and then went to the window to call her cat. ",16159,16282
167,"In an instant Pinkel again emptied the porridge into the bag, and the next minute he rolled on the floor, twisting himself about as if in agony, uttering loud groans the while. ",16282,16459
168,Suddenly he grew silent and lay still. ,16459,16498
169,'Ah! ,12803,12808
170,"I thought a second dose of that poison would be too much for you,' said the witch looking at him. ",16503,16601
171,'I warned you what would happen if you came back. ,16601,16651
172,I wish that all thieves were as dead as you! ,16651,16696
173,"But why does not my lazy girl bring the wood I sent her for, it will soon be too dark for her to find her way? ",16696,16807
174,I suppose I must go and search for her. ,16807,16847
175,What a trouble girls are!' ,16847,16874
176,And she went to the door to watch if there were any signs of her daughter. ,16874,16949
177,"But nothing could be seen of her, and heavy rain was falling. ",16949,17011
178,"'It is no night for my cloak,' she muttered; ",17011,17056
179, 'it would be covered with mud by the time I got back.' ,17055,17111
180,So she took it off her shoulders and hung it carefully up in a cupboard in the room. ,17111,17196
181,After that she put on her clogs and started to seek her daughter. ,17196,17262
182,"Directly the last sound of the clogs had ceased, Pinkel jumped up and took down the cloak, and rowed off as fast as he could. ",17262,17388
183,"He had not gone far when a puff of wind unfolded the cloak, and its brightness shed gleams across the water. ",17388,17497
184,"The witch, who was just entering the forest, turned round at that moment and saw the golden rays. ",17497,17595
185,"She forgot all about her daughter, and ran down to the shore, screaming with rage at being outwitted a third time. ",17595,17710
186,"'Is that you, Pinkel?' ",7887,7910
187,cried she. ,14810,14821
188,"'Yes, dear mother, it is I.' ",17744,17773
189,'Have you taken my gold cloak?' ,17773,17805
190,"'Yes, dear mother, I have.' ",17805,17833
191,'Are you not a great knave?' ,17833,17862
192,"'Yes, truly dear mother, I am.' ",17862,17894
193,And so indeed he was! ,17894,17916
194,"But, all the same, he carried the cloak to the king's palace, and in return he received the hand of the king's daughter in marriage. ",17916,18049
195,People said that it was the bride who ought to have worn the cloak at her wedding feast; ,18049,18138
196, but the king was so pleased with it that he would not part from it; ,18137,18206
197, and to the end of his life was never seen without it. ,18205,18260
198,"After his death, Pinkel became king; ",18260,18297
199," and let up hope that he gave up his bad and thievish ways, and ruled his subjects well. ",18296,18385
200,"As for his brothers, he did not punish them, but left them in the stables, where they grumbled all day long.",18385,18494
