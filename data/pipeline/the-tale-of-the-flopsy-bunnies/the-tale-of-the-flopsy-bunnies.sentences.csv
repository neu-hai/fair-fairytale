11,MR. McGREGOR'S rubbish heap was a mixture. ,764,807
12,"There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two. ",807,984
13,"One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had ""shot"" into flower. ",984,1077
14,THE Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. ,1077,1121

24,"WHILE she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; ",1861,1964

26,Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. ,2079,2121
27,The mouse hid in a jam pot. ,2121,2149
28,THE little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; ,2149,2225

40,"They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up. ",2795,2865
41,MR. McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall. ,2865,2920

52,"MR. McGREGOR came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off. ",3647,3714
53,"He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy. ",3714,3770
54,The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance. ,3770,3818
55,THEY watched him go into his house. ,3818,3854
56,And then they crept up to the window to listen. ,3854,3902
57,"MR. McGREGOR threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it. ",3902,4070
58,"They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle-- ""One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!"" ",4070,4184

71,MRS. McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it. ,4587,4636
