0,"Waupee, or the White Hawk, lived in a remote part of the forest, where animals abounded. ",0,89
1,"Every day he returned from the chase with a large spoil, for he was one of the most skillful and lucky hunters of his tribe. ",89,214
2,His form was like the cedar. ,214,243
3,The fire of youth beamed from his eye. ,243,282
4,"There was no forest too gloomy for him to penetrate, and no track made by bird or beast of any kind which he could not readily follow. ",282,417
5,One day he had gone beyond any point which he had ever before visited. ,417,488
6,"He traveled through an open wood, which enabled him to see a great distance. ",488,565
7,"At length he beheld a light breaking through the foliage of the distant trees, which made him sure that he was on the borders of a prairie. ",565,705
8,"It was a wide plain, covered with long blue grass, and enameled with flowers of a thousand lovely tints. ",705,810
9,"After walking for some time without a path, musing upon the open country, and enjoying the fragrant breeze, he suddenly came to a ring worn among the grass and the flowers. ",810,983
10,It was as if it had been made by footsteps moving lightly round and round. ,983,1058
11,But it was strange-so strange as to cause the White Hawk to pause and gaze long and fixedly upon the ground. ,1058,1167
12,There was no path which led to this flowery circle. ,1167,1219
13,"There was not even a crushed leaf nor a broken twig, nor the least trace of a footstep, approaching or retiring, to be found. ",1219,1345
14,"He thought he would hide himself and lie in wait to discover, if he could, what this strange circle meant. ",1345,1452
15,Presently he heard the faint sounds of music in the air. ,1452,1509
16,"He looked up in the direction they came from, and as the magic notes died away he saw a small object, like a little summer cloud that approaches the earth, floating down from above. ",1509,1691
17,"At first it was very small, and seemed as if it could have been blown away by the first breeze that came along. ",1691,1803
18,"But it rapidly grew as he gazed upon it, and the music every moment came clearer and more sweetly to his ear. ",1803,1913
19,"As it neared the earth it appeared as a basket, and it was filled with twelve sisters, of the most lovely forms and enchanting beauty. ",1913,2048
20,As soon as the basket touched the ground they leaped out. ,2048,2106
21,"They began straightway to dance, in the most joyous manner, around the magic ring, striking, as they did so, a shining ball, which uttered the most ravishing melodies, and kept time as they danced. ",2106,2304
22,"The White Hawk, from his concealment, entranced, gazed upon their graceful forms and movements. ",2304,2400
23,"He admired them all, but he was most pleased with the youngest. ",2400,2464
24,"He longed to be at her side, to embrace her, to call her his own. ",2464,2530
25,"Unable to remain longer a silent admirer, he rushed out and endeavored to seize this twelfth beauty who so enchanted him. ",2530,2652
26,"But the sisters, with the quickness of birds, the moment they descried the form of a man, leaped back into the basket, and were drawn up into the sky. ",2652,2803
27,"Lamenting his ill-luck, Waupee gazed longingly upon the fairy basket as it ascended and bore the lovely sisters from his view. ",2803,2930
28,"""They are gone,"" he said, ""and I shall see them no more."" ",2930,2988
29,"He returned to his solitary lodge, but he found no relief to his mind. ",2988,3059
30,"He walked abroad, but to look at the sky, which had withdrawn from his sight the only being he had ever loved, was painful to him now. ",3059,3194
31,"The next day, selecting the same hour, the White Hawk went back to the prairie, and took his station near the ring. ",3194,3310
32,"In order to deceive the sisters, he assumed the form of an opossum, and sat among the grass as if he were there engaged in chewing the cud. ",3310,3450
33,"He had not waited long when he saw the cloudy basket descend, and heard the same sweet music falling as before. ",3450,3562
34,He crept slowly toward the ring. ,3562,3595
35,"But the instant the sisters caught sight of him they were startled, and sprang into their car. ",3595,3690
36,"It rose a short distance when one of the elder sisters spoke: ""Perhaps,"" she said, ""it is come to show us how the game is played by mortals."" ",3690,3832
37,"""Oh no,"" the youngest replied; ",3832,3863
38," ""quick, let us ascend."" ",3862,3887
39,"And all joining in a chant, they rose out of sight. ",3887,3939
40,"Waupee, casting off his disguise, walked sorrowfully back to his lodge-but ah, the night seemed very long to lonely White Hawk! ",3939,4067
41,His whole soul was filled with the thought of the beautiful sister. ,4067,4135
42,"Betimes, the next day, he returned to the haunted spot, hoping and fearing, and sighing as though his very soul would leave his body in its anguish. ",4135,4284
43,He reflected upon the plan he should follow to secure success. ,4284,4347
44,He had already failed twice. ,4347,4376
45,To fail a third time would be fatal. ,4376,4413
46,"Near by he found an old stump, much covered with moss. ",4413,4468
47,"It was just then in use as the residence of a number of mice, who had stopped there on a pilgrimage to some relatives on the other side of the prairie. ",4468,4620
48,"The White Hawk was so pleased with their tidy little forms that he thought he, too, would be a mouse, especially as they were by no means formidable to look at, and would not be at all likely to create alarm. ",4620,4829
49,"He accordingly, having first brought the stump and set it near the ring, without further notice became a mouse. ",4829,4941
50,"He peeped and sported about, and kept his sharp little eyes busy with the others. ",4941,5023
51,"But he did not forget to keep one eye up toward the sky, and one ear wide open in the same direction. ",5023,5125
52,"It was not long before the sisters, at their customary hour, came down and resumed their sport. ",5125,5221
53,"""But see,"" cried the younger sister, ""that stump was not there before."" ",5221,5293
54,"She ran off, frightened, toward the basket. ",5293,5337
55,"Her sisters only smiled, and gathering round the old tree-stump, they struck it, in jest, when out ran the mice, and among them Waupee. ",5337,5473
56,"They killed them all but one, which was pursued by the younger sister. ",5473,5544
57,"Just as she had raised a silver stick which she held in her hand to put an end to it, too, the form of the White Hawk arose, and he clasped his prize in his arms. ",5544,5707
58,"The other eleven sprang to their basket, and were drawn up to the skies. ",5707,5780
59,Waupee exerted all his skill to please his bride and win her affections. ,5780,5853
60,He wiped the tears from her eyes. ,5853,5887
61,He related his adventures in the chase. ,5887,5927
62,He dwelt upon the charms of life on the earth. ,5927,5974
63,"He was constant in his attentions, keeping fondly by her side, and picking out the way for her to walk as he led her gently toward his lodge. ",5974,6116
64,"He felt his heart glow with joy as he entered it, and from that moment he was one of the happiest of men. ",6116,6222
65,Winter and summer passed rapidly away. ,6222,6261
66,"As the spring drew near with its balmy gales and its many-colored flowers, their happiness was increased by the presence of a beautiful boy in their lodge. ",6261,6417
67,What more of earthly blessing was there for them to enjoy? ,6417,6476
68,Waupee's wife was a daughter of one of the stars. ,6476,6526
69,"As the scenes of earth began to pall upon her sight, she sighed to revisit her father. ",6526,6613
70,But she was obliged to hide these feelings from her husband. ,6613,6674
71,"She remembered the charm that would carry her up, and while White Hawk was engaged in the chase, she took occasion to construct a wicker basket, which she kept concealed. ",6674,6845
72,"In the mean time, she collected such rarities from the earth as she thought would please her father, as well as the most dainty kinds of food. ",6845,6988
73,"One day when Waupee was absent, and all was in readiness, she went out to the charmed ring, taking with her her little son. ",6988,7112
74,"As they entered the car she commenced her magical song, and the basket rose. ",7112,7189
75,"The song was sad, and of a lowly and mournful cadence. ",7189,7244
76,"As it was wafted far away by the wind, it caught her husband's ear. ",7244,7312
77,"It was a voice which he well knew, and he instantly ran to the prairie. ",7312,7384
78,"Though he made breathless speed, he could not reach the ring before his wife and child had ascended beyond his reach. ",7384,7502
79,"He lifted up his voice in loud appeals, but they were unavailing. ",7502,7568
80,The basket still went up. ,7568,7594
81,"He watched it till it became a small speck, and finally it vanished in the sky. ",7594,7674
82,"He then bent his head down to the ground, and was miserable. ",7674,7735
83,"Through a long winter and a long summer Waupee bewailed his loss, but he found no relief. ",7735,7825
84,"The beautiful spirit had come and gone, and he should see it no more! ",7825,7895
85,"He mourned his wife's loss sorely, but his son's still more. ",7895,7956
86,The boy had both the mother's beauty and the father's strength. ,7956,8020
87,In the mean time his wife had reached her home in the stars. ,8020,8081
88,In the blissful employments of her father's house she had almost forgotten that she had left a husband upon the earth. ,8081,8200
89,"But her son, as he grew up, resembled more and more his father. ",8200,8264
90,Every day he was restless and anxious to visit the scene of his birth. ,8264,8335
91,"His grandfather said to his daughter, one day: ""Go, my child, and take your son down to his father, and ask him to come up and live with us. ",8335,8476
92,"But tell him to bring along a specimen of each kind of bird and animal he kills in the chase."" ",8476,8571
93,She accordingly took the boy and descended. ,8571,8615
94,"The White Hawk, who was ever near the enchanted spot, heard her voice as she came down the sky. ",8615,8711
95,"His heart beat with impatience as he saw her form and that of his son, and they were soon clasped in his arms. ",8711,8822
96,"He heard the message of the Star, and he began to hunt with the greatest activity, that he might collect the present with all dispatch. ",8822,8958
97,"He spent whole nights, as well as days, in searching for every curious and beautiful animal and bird. ",8958,9060
98,"He only preserved a foot, a wing, or a tail of each. ",9060,9113
99,"When all was ready, Waupee visited once more each favorite spot. ",9113,9178
100,The hill-top where he had been used to see the rising sun. ,9178,9237
101,The stream where he had sported as a boy. ,9237,9279
102,"The old lodge, now looking sad and solemn, which he was to sit in no more. ",9279,9354
103,"Last of all, coming to the magic circle, he gazed widely around him with tearful eyes. ",9354,9441
104,"Taking his wife and child by the hand, they entered the car and were drawn up-into a country far beyond the flight of birds, or the power of mortal eye to pierce. ",9441,9604
105,Great joy was manifested upon their arrival at the starry plains. ,9604,9670
106,The Star Chief invited all his people to a feast. ,9670,9720
107,"When they had assembled, he proclaimed aloud that each one might continue as he was, an inhabitant of his own dominions, or select of the earthly gifts such as he liked best. ",9720,9895
108,A very strange confusion immediately arose. ,9895,9939
109,Not one but sprang forward. ,9939,9967
110,"Some chose a foot, some a wing, some a tail, and some a claw. ",9967,10029
111,"Those who selected tails or claws were changed into animals, and ran off. ",10029,10103
112,"The others assumed the form of birds, and flew away. ",10103,10156
113,Waupee chose a white hawk's feather. ,10156,10193
114,"His wife and son followed his example, and each one became a white hawk. ",10193,10266
115,"He spread his wings, and, followed by his wife and son, descended with the other birds to the earth, where he is still to be found, with the brightness of the starry plains in his eye, and the freedom of the heavenly breezes in his wings.",10266,10505
