0,"In a region of country where the forest and the prairie strived which should be the most beautiful-the open plain, with its free sunshine and winds and flowers, or the close wood, with its delicious twilight-walks and enamored haunts-there lived a wicked manito in the disguise of an old Indian. ",0,296
1,"Although the country furnished an abundance of game, and whatever else a good heart could wish for, it was the study of this wicked genius to destroy such as fell into his hands. ",296,475
2,"He made use of all his arts to decoy men into his power, for the purpose of killing them. ",475,565
3,"The country had been once thickly peopled, but this Mudjee Monedo had so thinned it by his cruel practices, that he now lived almost solitary in the wilderness. ",565,726
4,The secret of his success lay in his great speed. ,726,776
5,"He had the power to assume the shape of any four-footed creature, and it was his custom to challenge such as he sought to destroy, to run with him. ",776,924
6,"He had a beaten path on which he ran, leading around a large lake, and he always ran around this circle so that the starting and the winning-post was the same. ",924,1084
7,"Whoever failed as every one had, yielded up his life at this post; ",1084,1151
8," and although he ran every day, no man was ever known to beat this evil genius; ",1150,1230
9," for whenever he was pressed hard, he changed himself into a fox, wolf, deer, or other swift-footed animal, and was thus able to leave his competitor behind. ",1229,1387
10,"The whole country was in dread of this same Mudjee Monedo, and yet the young men were constantly running with him; ",1387,1502
11," for if they refused, he called them cowards, which was a reproach they could not bear. ",1501,1589
12,They would rather die than be called cowards. ,1589,1635
13,"To keep up his sport, the manito made light of these deadly foot-matches, and instead of assuming a braggart air, and going about in a boastful way, with the blood of such as he had overcome, upon his hands, he adopted very pleasing manners, and visited the lodges around the country as any other sweet-tempered and harmless old Indian might. ",1635,1978
14,His secret object in these friendly visits was to learn whether the young boys were getting old enough to run with him; ,1978,2098
15," he kept a very sharp eye upon their growth, and the day he thought them ready, he did not fail to challenge them to a trial on his racing-ground. ",2097,2244
16,There was not a family in all that beautiful region which had not in this way been visited and thinned out; ,2244,2352
17, and the manito had quite naturally come to be held in abhorrence by all the Indian mothers in the country. ,2351,2459
18,"It happened that there lived near him a poor widow woman, whose husband and seven sons he had made way with; ",2459,2568
19," and she was now living with an only daughter, and a son of ten or twelve years old. ",2567,2652
20,"This widow was very poor and feeble, and she suffered so much for lack of food and other comforts of the lodge, that she would have been glad to die, but for her daughter and her little son. ",2652,2843
21,The Mudjee Monedo had already visited her lodge to observe whether the boy was sufficiently grown to be challenged to the race; ,2843,2971
22," and so crafty in his approaches and so soft in his manners was the monedo, that the mother feared that he would yet decoy the son and make way with him as he had done with his father and his seven brothers, in spite of all her struggles to save him. ",2970,3221
23,And yet she strove with all her might to strengthen her son in every good course. ,3221,3303
24,"She taught him, as best she could, what was becoming for the wise hunter and the brave warrior. ",3303,3399
25,She remembered and set before him all that she could recall of the skill and the craft of his father and his brothers who were lost. ,3399,3532
26,The widow woman also instructed her daughter in whatever could make her useful as a wife; ,3532,3622
27," and in the leisure-time of the lodge, she gave her lessons in the art of working with the quills of porcupine, and bestowed on her such other accomplishments as should make her an ornament and a blessing to her husband's household. ",3621,3854
28,"The daughter, Minda by name, was kind and obedient to her mother, and never failed in her duty. ",3854,3950
29,"Their lodge stood high up on the banks of a lake, which gave them a wide prospect of country, embellished with groves and open fields, which waved with the blue light of their long grass, and made, at all hours of sun and moon, a cheerful scene to look upon. ",3950,4209
30,"Across this beautiful prairie, Minda had one morning made her way to gather dry limbs for their fire; ",4209,4311
31, for she disdained no labor of the lodge. ,4310,4352
32,"And while enjoying the sweetness of the air and the green beauty of the woods, she strolled far away. ",4352,4454
33,"She had come to a bank, painted with flowers of every hue, and was reclining on its fragrant couch, when a bird, of red and deep-blue plumage softly blended, alighted on a branch near by, and began to pour forth its carol. ",4454,4677
34,"It was a bird of strange character, such as she had never before seen. ",4677,4748
35,"Its first note was so delicious to the ear of Minda, and it so pierced to her young heart, that she listened as she had never before to any mortal or heavenly sound. ",4748,4914
36,"It seemed like the human voice, forbidden to speak, and uttering its language through this wild wood-chant with a mournful melody, as if it bewailed the lack of the power or the right to make itself more plainly intelligible. ",4914,5140
37,"The voice of the bird rose and fell, and circled round and round, but whithersoever floated or spread out its notes, they seemed ever to have their center where Minda sat; ",5140,5312
38," and she looked with sad eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird, that sat in his red and deep-blue plumage just opposite to the flowery bank. ",5311,5458
39,"The poor bird strove more and more with his voice, and seemed ever more and more anxiously to address his notes of lament to Minda's ear, till at last she could not refrain from saying, ""What aileth thee, sad bird?"" ",5458,5674
40,"As if he had but waited to be spoken to, the bird left his branch, and alighting upon the bank, smiled on Minda, and, shaking his shining plumage, answered: ""I am bound in this condition until a maiden shall accept me in marriage. ",5674,5905
41,"I have wandered these groves and sung to many and many of the Indian girls, but none ever heeded my voice till you. ",5905,6021
42,"Will you be mine?"" ",6021,6040
43,"he added, and poured forth a flood of melody which sparkled and spread itself with its sweet murmurs over all the scene, and fairly entranced the young Minda, who sat silent, as if she feared to break the charm by speech. ",6040,6262
44,"The bird, approaching nearer, asked her, if she loved him, to get her mother's consent to their marriage. ",6262,6368
45,"""I shall be free then,"" said the bird, ""and you shall know me as I am."" ",6368,6440
46,"Minda lingered, and listened to the sweet voice of the bird in its own forest notes, or filling each pause with gentle human discourse; ",6440,6576
47," questioning her as to her home, her family, and the little incidents of her daily life. ",6575,6664
48,"She returned to the lodge later than usual, but she was too timid to speak to her mother of that which the bird had charged her. ",6664,6793
49,She returned again and again to the fragrant haunt in the wood; ,6793,6857
50," and everyday she listened to the song and the discourse of her bird admirer with more pleasure, and he every day besought her to speak to her mother of the marriage. ",6856,7023
51,"This she could not, however, muster heart and courage to do. ",7023,7084
52,"At last the widow began herself to have a suspicion that her daughter's heart was in the wood, from her long delays in returning, and the little success she had in gathering the fire-branches for which she went in search. ",7084,7306
53,"In answer to her mother's questions, Minda revealed the truth, and made known her lover's request. ",7306,7405
54,"The mother, considering the lonely and destitute condition of her little household, gave her consent. ",7405,7507
55,"The daughter, with light steps, hastened with the news to the wood. ",7507,7575
56,"The bird lover of course heard it with delight, and fluttered through the air in happy circles, and poured forth a song of joy which thrilled Minda to the heart. ",7575,7737
57,"He said that he would come to the lodge at sunset, and immediately took wing, while Minda hung fondly upon his flight, till he was lost far away in the blue sky. ",7737,7899
58,"With the twilight the bird lover, whose name was Monedowa, appeared at the door of the lodge, as a hunter, with a red plume and a mantle of blue upon his shoulders. ",7899,8064
59,"He addressed the widow as his friend, and she directed him to sit down beside her daughter, and they were regarded as man and wife. ",8064,8196
60,"Early on the following morning, he asked for the bow and arrows of those who had been slain by the wicked manito, and went out a-hunting. ",8196,8334
61,"As soon as he had got out of sight of the lodge, he changed himself into the wood-bird, as he had been before his marriage, and took his flight through the air. ",8334,8495
62,"Although game was scarce in the neighborhood of the widow's lodge, Monedowa returned at evening, in his character of a hunter, with two deer. ",8495,8637
63,"This was his daily practice, and the widow's family never more lacked for food. ",8637,8717
64,"It was noticed, however, that Monedowa himself ate but little, and that of a peculiar kind of meat, flavored with berries, which, with other circumstances, convinced them that he was not as the Indian people around him. ",8717,8937
65,"In a few days his mother-in-law told him that the manito would come to pay them a visit, to see how the young man, her son, prospered. ",8937,9072
66,Monedowa answered that he should on that day be absent. ,9072,9128
67,"When the time arrived, he flew upon a tall tree, overlooking the lodge, and took his station there as the wicked manito passed in. ",9128,9259
68,"The mudjee monedo cast sharp glances at the scaffolds so well laden with meat, and as soon as he had entered, he said, ""Why, who is it that is furnishing you with meat so plentifully?"" ",9259,9444
69,"""No one,"" she answered, ""but my son; ",9444,9481
70," he is just beginning to kill deer."" ",9480,9517
71,"""No, no,"" he retorted; ",9517,9540
72," ""some one is living with you."" ",9539,9571
73,"""Kaween, no indeed,"" replied the widow; ",9571,9611
74," ""you are only making sport of my hapless condition. ",9610,9663
75,"Who do you think would come and trouble themselves about me?"" ",9663,9725
76,"""Very well,"" answered the manito, ""I will go; ",9725,9771
77," but on such a day I will again visit you, and see who it is that furnishes the meat, and whether it is your son or not."" ",9770,9892
78,"He had no sooner left the lodge and got out of sight, than the son-in-law made his appearance with two more deer. ",9892,10006
79,"On being made acquainted with the conduct of the manito, ""Very well,"" he said, ""I will be at home the next time, to see him."" ",10006,10132
80,Both the mother and the wife urged Monedowa to be aware of the manito. ,10132,10203
81,"They made known to him all of his cruel courses, and assured him that no man could escape from his power. ",10203,10309
82,"""No matter,"" said Monedowa; ",10309,10337
83," ""if he invites me to the race-ground, I will not be backward. ",10336,10399
84,"What follows, may teach him, my mother, to show pity on the vanquished, and not to trample on the widow and those who are without fathers."" ",10399,10539
85,"When the day of the visit of the manito arrived, Monedowa told his wife to prepare certain pieces of meat, which he pointed out to her, together with two or three buds of the birch-tree, which he requested her to put in the pot. ",10539,10768
86,"He directed also that the manito should be hospitably received, as if he had been just the kind-hearted old Indian he professed to be. ",10768,10903
87,"Monedowa then dressed himself as a warrior, embellishing his visage with tints of red, to show that he was prepared for either war or peace. ",10903,11044
88,"As soon as the mudjee monedo arrived, he eyed this strange warrior whom he had never seen before; ",11044,11142
89," but he dissembled, as usual, and, with a gentle laugh, said to the widow, ""Did I not tell you that some one was staying with you, for I knew your son was too young to hunt."" ",11141,11316
90,"The widow excused herself by saying that she did not think it necessary to tell him, inasmuch as he was a manito, and must have known before he asked. ",11316,11467
91,"The manito was very pleasant with Monedowa, and after much other discourse, in a gentle-spoken voice, he invited him to the racing-ground, saying it was a manly amusement, that he would have an excellent chance to meet there with other warriors, and that he should himself be pleased to run with him. ",11467,11768
92,"Monedowa would have excused himself, saying that he knew nothing of running. ",11768,11845
93,"""Why,"" replied the mudjee monedo, trembling in every limb as he spoke, ""don't you see how old I look, while you are young and full of life. ",11845,11985
94,"We must at least run a little to amuse others."" ",11985,12033
95,"""Be it so, then,"" replied Monedowa. ",12033,12069
96,"""I will oblige you. ",12069,12089
97,"I will go in the morning."" ",12089,12116
98,"Pleased with his crafty success, the manito would have now taken his leave, but he was pressed to remain and partake of their hospitality. ",12116,12255
99,The meal was immediately prepared. ,12255,12290
100,But one dish was used. ,12290,12313
101,"Monedowa partook of it first, to show his guest that he need not fear, saying at the same time, ""It is a feast, and as we seldom meet, we must eat all that is placed on the dish, as a mark of gratitude to the Great Spirit for permitting me to kill animals, and for the pleasure of seeing you, and partaking of it with you."" ",12313,12637
102,"They ate and talked, on this and that, until they had nearly dispatched the meal, when the manito took up the dish and drank off the broth at a breath. ",12637,12789
103,On setting it down he immediately turned his head and commenced coughing with great violence. ,12789,12883
104,"The old body in which he had disguised himself was well-nigh shaken in pieces, for he had, as Monedowa expected, swallowed a grain of the birch-bud, and this, which relished to himself as being of the bird nature, greatly distressed the old manito, who partook of the character of an animal, or four-footed thing. ",12883,13197
105,"He was at last put to such confusion of face by his constant coughing, that he was enforced to leave, saying, or rather hiccoughing as he left the lodge, that he should look for the young man at the racing-ground in the morning. ",13197,13426
106,"When the morning came, Monedowa was early astir, oiling his limbs and enameling his breast and arms with red and blue, resembling the plumage in which he had first appeared to Minda. ",13426,13609
107,Upon his brow he placed a tuft of feathers of the same shining tints. ,13609,13679
108,"By his invitation his wife, Minda, the mother and her young son, attended Monedowa to the manito's racing-ground. ",13679,13793
109,"The lodge of the manito stood upon a high ground, and near it stretched out a long row of other lodges, said to be possessed by wicked kindred of his, who shared in the spoils of his cruelty. ",13793,13985
110,"As soon as the young hunter and his party approached, the inmates appeared at their lodge-doors and cried out: ""We are visited."" ",13985,14114
111,"At this cry, the mudjee monedo came forth and descended with his companions to the starting-post on the plain. ",14114,14225
112,"From this the course could be seen, winding in a long girdle about the lake; ",14225,14302
113," and as they were now all assembled, the old manito began to speak of the race, belted himself up and pointed to the post, which was an upright pillar of stone. ",14301,14462
114,"""But before we start,"" said the manito, ""I wish it to be understood that when men run with me I make a wager, and I expect them to abide by it-life against life."" ",14462,14625
115,"""Very well-be it so,"" answered Monedowa. ",14625,14666
116,"""We shall see whose head is to be dashed against the stone."" ",14666,14727
117,"""We shall,"" rejoined the mudjee monedo. ",14727,14767
118,"""I am very old, but I shall try and make a run."" ",14767,14816
119,"""Very well,"" again rejoined Monedowa; ",14816,14854
120," ""I hope we shall both stand to our bargain."" ",14853,14899
121,"""Good!"" ",14899,14907
122,said the old manito; ,14907,14928
123," and he at the same time cast a sly glance at the young hunter, and rolled his eyes toward where stood the pillar of stone. ",14927,15051
124,"""I am ready,"" said Monedowa. ",15051,15080
125,"The starting shout was given, and they set off at high speed, the manito leading, and Monedowa pressing closely after. ",15080,15199
126,"As he closed upon him, the old manito began to show his power, and changing himself into a fox he passed the young hunter with ease, and went leisurely along. ",15199,15358
127,"Monedowa now, with a glance upward, took the shape of the strange bird of red and deep-blue plumage, and with one flight, lighting at some distance ahead of the manito, resumed his mortal shape. ",15358,15553
128,"When the mudjee monedo espied his competitor before him, ""Whoa! ",15553,15617
129,"whoa!"" ",15617,15624
130,he exclaimed; ,15624,15638
131," ""this is strange;""",15637,15656
132,""" and he immediately changed himself into a wolf, and sped past Monedowa. ",15655,15729
133,"As he galloped by, Monedowa heard a noise from his throat, and he knew that he was still in distress from the birch-bud which he had swallowed at his mother-in-law's lodge. ",15729,15902
134,"Monedowa again took wing, and, shooting into the air, he descended suddenly with great swiftness, and took the path far ahead of the old manito. ",15902,16047
135,"As he passed the wolf he whispered in his ear: ""My friend, is this the extent of your speed?"" ",16047,16141
136,"The manito began to be troubled with bad forebodings, for, on looking ahead, he saw the young hunter in his own manly form, running along at leisure. ",16141,16291
137,"The mudjee monedo, seeing the necessity of more speed, now passed Monedowa in the shape of a deer. ",16291,16390
138,"They were now far around the circle of the lake, and fast closing in upon the starting-post, when Monedowa, putting on his red and blue plumage, glided along the air and alighted upon the track far in advance. ",16390,16600
139,"To overtake him, the old manito assumed the shape of the buffalo; ",16600,16666
140, and he pushed on with such long gallops that he was again the foremost on the course. ,16665,16752
141,"The buffalo was the last change he could make, and it was in this form that he had most frequently conquered. ",16752,16862
142,"The young hunter, once more a bird, in the act of passing the manito, saw his tongue lolling from his mouth with fatigue. ",16862,16984
143,"""My friend,"" said Monedowa, ""is this all your speed?"" ",16984,17038
144,The manito made no answer. ,17038,17065
145,"Monedowa had resumed his character of a hunter, and was within a run of the winning-post, when the wicked manito had nearly overtaken him. ",17065,17204
146,"""Bakah! ",17204,17212
147,bakah! ,17212,17219
148,"nejee!"" ",17219,17227
149,he called out to Monedowa; ,17227,17254
150," ""stop, my friend, I wish to talk to you."" ",17253,17296
151,"Monedowa laughed aloud as he replied: ""I will speak to you at the starting-post. ",17296,17377
152,"When men run with me I make a wager, and I expect them to abide by it-life against life."" ",17377,17467
153,"One more flight as the blue bird with red wings, and Monedowa was so near to the goal that he could easily reach it in his mortal shape. ",17467,17604
154,"Shining in beauty, his face lighted up like the sky, with tinted arms and bosom gleaming in the sun, and the parti-colored plume on his brow waving in the wind. ",17604,17765
155,"Monedowa, cheered by a joyful shout from his own people, leaped to the post. ",17765,17842
156,The manito came on with fear in his face. ,17842,17884
157,"""My friend,"" he said, ""spare my life;""",17884,17922
158,""" and then added, in a low voice, as if he would not that the others should hear it, ""Give me to live."" ",17921,18025
159,And he began to move off as if the request had been granted. ,18025,18086
160,"""As you have done to others,"" replied Monedowa, ""so shall it be done to you."" ",18086,18164
161,"And seizing the wicked manito, he dashed him against the pillar of stone. ",18164,18238
162,"His kindred, who were looking on in horror, raised a cry of fear and fled away in a body to some distant land, whence they have never returned. ",18238,18382
163,"The widow's family left the scene, and when they had all come out into the open fields, they walked on together until they had reached the fragrant bank and the evergreen wood, where the daughter had first encountered her bird lover. ",18382,18616
164,"Monedowa turning to her, said: ""My mother, here we must part. ",18616,18678
165,Your daughter and myself must now leave you. ,18678,18723
166,"The Good Spirit, moved with pity, has allowed me to be your friend. ",18723,18791
167,I have done that for which I was sent. ,18791,18830
168,I am permitted to take with me the one whom I love. ,18830,18882
169,"I have found your daughter ever kind, gentle and just. ",18882,18937
170,She shall be my companion. ,18937,18964
171,The blessing of the Good Spirit be ever with you. ,18964,19014
172,"Farewell, my mother-my brother, farewell."" ",19014,19057
173,"While the widow woman was still lost in wonder at these words, Monedowa, and Minda his wife, changed at the same moment, rose into the air, as beautiful birds, clothed in shining colors of red and blue. ",19057,19260
174,"They caroled together as they flew, and their songs were happy, and falling, falling, like clear drops, as they rose, and rose, and winged their way far upward, a delicious peace came into the mind of the poor widow woman, and she returned to her lodge deeply thankful at heart for all the goodness that had been shown to her by the Master of Life. ",19260,19609
175,"From that day forth she never knew want, and her young son proved a comfort to her lodge, and the tuneful carol of Monedowa and Minda, as it fell from heaven, was a music always, go whither she would, sounding peace and joy in her ear.",19609,19845
