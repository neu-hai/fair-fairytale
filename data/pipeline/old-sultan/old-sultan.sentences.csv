0,"THERE was once a peasant who owned a faithful dog called Sultan, now grown so old that he had lost all his teeth, and could lay hold of nothing. ",0,145
1,"One day the man was standing at the door of his house with his wife, and he said, ""I shall kill old Sultan to-morrow; ",145,263
2," he is of no good any longer."" ",262,293
3,"His wife felt sorry for the poor dog, and answered, ""He has served us for so many years, and has kept with us so faithfully, he deserves food and shelter in his old age."" ",293,464
4,"""Dear me, you do not seem to understand the matter,"" said the husband; ",464,535
5," ""he has never a tooth, and no thief would mind him in the least, so I do not see why he should not be made away with. ",534,653
6,"If he has served us well, we have given him plenty of good food."" ",653,719
7,"The poor dog, who was lying stretched out in the sun not far off, heard all they said, and was very sad to think that the next day would be his last. ",719,869
8,"He bethought him of his great friend the wolf, and slipped out in the evening to the wood to see him, and related to him the fate that was awaiting him. ",869,1022
9,"""Listen to me, old fellow,"" said the wolf; ",1022,1065
10," ""be of good courage, I will help you in your need. ",1064,1116
11,I have thought of a way. ,1116,1141
12,"Early to-morrow morning your master is going hay-making with his wife, and they will take their child with them, so that no one will be left at home. ",1141,1291
13,They will be sure to lay the child in the shade behind the hedge while they are at work; ,1291,1380
14," you must lie by its side, just as if you were watching it. ",1379,1439
15,Then I will come out of the wood and steal away the child; ,1439,1498
16," you must rush after me, as if to save it from me. ",1497,1548
17,"Then I must let it fall, and you must bring it back again to its parents, who will think that you have saved it, and will be much too grateful to do you any harm; ",1548,1711
18," on the contrary, you will be received into full favour, and they will never let you want for anything again."" ",1710,1821
19,"The dog was pleased with the plan, which was carried out accordingly. ",1821,1891
20,"When the father saw the wolf running away with his child he cried out, and when old Sultan brought it back again, he was much pleased with him, and patted him, saying, ""Not a hair of him shall be touched; ",1891,2096
21," he shall have food and shelter as long as he lives."" ",2095,2149
22,"And he said to his wife, ""Go home directly and make some good stew for old Sultan, something that does not need biting; ",2149,2269
23," and get the pillow from my bed for him to lie on."" ",2268,2320
24,From that time old Sultan was made so comfortable that he had nothing left to wish for. ,2320,2408
25,"Before long the wolf paid him a visit, to congratulate him that all had gone so well. ",2408,2494
26,"""But, old fellow,"" said he, ""you must wink at my making off by chance with a fat sheep of your master's; ",2494,2599
27," perhaps one will escape some fine day."" ",2598,2639
28,"""Don't reckon on that,"" answered the dog; ",2639,2681
29," ""I cannot consent to it; ",2680,2706
30," I must remain true to my master."" ",2705,2740
31,"But the wolf, not supposing it was said in earnest, came sneaking in the night to carry off the sheep. ",2740,2843
32,"But the master, who had been warned by the faithful Sultan of the wolf's intention, was waiting for him, and gave him a fine hiding with the threshing-flail. ",2843,3001
33,"So the wolf had to make his escape, calling out to the dog, ""You shall pay for this, you traitor!"" ",3001,3100
34,The next morning the wolf sent the wild boar to call out the dog; ,3100,3166
35, and to appoint a meeting in the wood to receive satisfaction from him. ,3165,3237
36,Old Sultan could find no second but a cat with three legs; ,3237,3296
37," and as they set off together, the poor thing went limping along, holding her tail up in the air. ",3295,3393
38,The wolf and his second were already on the spot; ,3393,3443
39," when they saw their antagonists coming, and caught sight of the elevated tail of the cat, they thought it was a sabre they were bringing with them. ",3442,3591
40,"And as the poor thing came limping on three legs, they supposed it was lifting a big stone to throw at them. ",3591,3700
41,This frightened them very much; ,3700,3732
42," the wild boar crept among the leaves, and the wolf clambered up into a tree. ",3731,3809
43,"And when the dog and cat came up, they were surprised not to see any one there. ",3809,3889
44,"However, the wild boar was not perfectly hidden in the leaves, and the tips of his ears peeped out. ",3889,3989
45,"And when the cat caught sight of one, she thought it was a mouse, and sprang upon it, seizing it with her teeth. ",3989,4102
46,"Out leaped the wild boar with a dreadful cry, and ran away shouting, ""There is the culprit in the tree!"" ",4102,4207
47,"And the dog and the cat looking up caught sight of the wolf, who came down, quite ashamed of his timidity, and made peace with the dog once more.",4207,4353
