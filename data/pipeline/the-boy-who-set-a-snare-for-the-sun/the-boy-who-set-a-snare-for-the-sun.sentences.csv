0,"At the time when the animals reigned in the earth, they had killed all the people but a girl and her little brother. ",0,117
1,"These two were living in fear, in an out-of-the-way place. ",117,176
2,"The boy was a perfect little pigmy, and never grew beyond the size of a mere infant. ",176,261
3,"The girl increased with her years, so that the task of providing food and shelter fell wholly upon her. ",261,365
4,"She went out daily to get wood for the lodge-fire, and she took her little brother with her that no mishap might befall him. ",365,490
5,He was too little to leave alone. ,490,524
6,"A big bird, of a mischievous disposition, might have flown away with him. ",524,598
7,"She made him a bow and arrows, and said to him one day, ""My little brother, I will leave you behind where I have been gathering the wood. ",598,736
8,"You must hide yourself, and you will soon see the snow-birds come and pick the worms out of the logs which I have piled up. ",736,860
9,"Shoot one of them and bring it home."" ",860,898
10,"He obeyed her, and tried his best to kill one, but he came home unsuccessful. ",898,976
11,"His sister told him that he must not despair, but try again the next day. ",976,1050
12,"She accordingly left him at the gathering-place of the wood, and returned to the lodge. ",1050,1138
13,Toward night-fall she heard his little footsteps crackling through the snow. ,1138,1215
14,"He hurried in and threw down, with an air of triumph, one of the birds which he had killed. ",1215,1307
15,"""My sister,"" said he, ""I wish you to skin it, and stretch the skin, and when I have killed more, I will have a coat made out of them."" ",1307,1442
16,"""But what shall we do with the body?"" ",1442,1480
17,said she; ,1480,1490
18, for they had always up to that time lived upon greens and berries. ,1489,1557
19,"""Cut it in two,"" he answered, ""and season our pottage with one half of it at a time."" ",1557,1643
20,"It was their first dish of game, and they relished it greatly. ",1643,1706
21,"The boy kept on in his efforts, and in the course of time he killed ten birds-out of the skins of which his sister made him a little coat. ",1706,1845
22,"Being very small, he had a very pretty coat, and a bird skin to spare. ",1845,1916
23,"""Sister,"" said he, one day, as he paraded up and down before the lodge, enjoying his new coat, and fancifying himself the greatest little fellow in the world-as he was, for there was no other beside him-""My sister, are we really alone in the world, or are we playing at it? ",1916,2190
24,Is there nobody else living? ,2190,2219
25,"And, tell me, was all this great broad earth and this huge big sky made for a little boy and girl like you and me?"" ",2219,2335
26,"She told him, by no means that there were many folks very unlike a harmless girl and boy, such as they were, who lived in a certain other quarter of the earth, who had killed off all of their kinsfolk. ",2335,2537
27,"That if he would live blameless and not endanger his life, he must never go where they were. ",2537,2630
28,This only served to inflame the boy's curiosity. ,2630,2679
29,He soon after took his bow and arrows and went in that direction. ,2679,2745
30,"After walking a long time and meeting no one, he became tired, and stretched himself upon a high green knoll where the day's warmth had melted off the snow. ",2745,2902
31,"It was a charming place to lie upon, and he fell asleep. ",2902,2959
32,"While sleeping, the sun beat so hot upon him that it not only singed his bird-skin coat, but it so shrivelled and shrunk and tightened it upon the little boy's body, as to wake him up. ",2959,3144
33,"When he felt how the sun had seared and the mischief its fiery beams had played with the coat he was so proud of, he flew into a great passion, and berated the sun in a terrible way for a little boy no higher than a man's knee. ",3144,3372
34,He vowed fearful things against it. ,3372,3408
35,"""Do not think you are too high,"" said he; ",3408,3450
36," ""I shall revenge myself. ",3449,3475
37,"Oh, sun! ",3475,3484
38,"I will have you for a plaything yet."" ",3484,3522
39,"On coming home he gave an account of his misfortune to his sister, and bitterly bewailed the spoiling of his new coat. ",3522,3641
40,He would not eat-not so much as a single berry. ,3641,3689
41,He lay down as one that fasts; ,3689,3720
42," nor did he move nor change his manner of lying for ten full days, though his sister strove to prevail on him to rise. ",3719,3838
43,"At the end of ten days he turned over, and then he lay full ten days on the other side. ",3838,3926
44,"When he got up he was very pale, but very resolute too. ",3926,3982
45,"He bade his sister make a snare, for, he informed her, that he meant to catch the sun. ",3982,4069
46,She said she had nothing. ,4069,4095
47,"But after awhile she brought forward a deer's sinew which the father had left, and which she soon made into a string suitable for a noose. ",4095,4234
48,"The moment she showed it to him he was quite angry, and told her that would not do, and directed her to find something else. ",4234,4359
49,She said she had nothing-nothing at all. ,4359,4400
50,At last she thought of the bird-skin that was left over when the coat was made; ,4400,4480
51, and this she wrought into a string. ,4479,4516
52,With this the little boy was more vexed than before. ,4516,4569
53,"""The sun has had enough of my bird-skins,"" he said; ",4569,4621
54," ""find something else."" ",4620,4644
55,"She went out of the lodge saying to herself, ""Was there ever so obstinate a boy?"" ",4644,4726
56,She did not dare to answer this time that she had nothing. ,4726,4785
57,"Luckily she thought of her own beautiful hair, and pulling some of it from among her locks, she quickly braided it into a cord. ",4785,4913
58,"Upon returning, she handed it to her brother. ",4913,4959
59,The moment his eye fell upon this jet black braid he was delighted. ,4959,5027
60,"""This will do,"" he said. ",5027,5052
61,He immediately began to run it back and forth through his hands as swiftly as he could. ,5052,5140
62,"As he drew it forth, he tried its strength. ",5140,5184
63,"He said again, ""this will do;""",5184,5214
64,""" and winding it in a glossy coil about his shoulders, he set out a little after midnight. ",5213,5304
65,His object was to catch the sun before he rose. ,5304,5352
66,He fixed his snare firmly on a spot just where the sun must strike the land as it rose above the earth. ,5352,5456
67,"Sure enough, he caught the sun, so that it was held fast in the cord and did not rise. ",5456,5543
68,The animals who ruled the earth were immediately put into great commotion. ,5543,5618
69,They had no light. ,5618,5637
70,"They ran to and fro, calling out to each other, and inquiring what had happened. ",5637,5718
71,"They summoned a council to debate upon the matter, and an old dormouse, suspecting where the trouble lay, proposed that some one should be appointed to go and cut the cord. ",5718,5891
72,"This was a bold thing to undertake, as the rays of the sun could not fail to burn whoever should venture so near to them. ",5891,6013
73,"At last the venerable dormouse himself undertook it, for the very good reason that no one else would. ",6013,6115
74,At this time the dormouse was the largest animal in the world. ,6115,6178
75,When he stood up he looked like a mountain. ,6178,6222
76,"It made haste to the place where the sun lay ensnared, and as it came nearer and nearer, its back began to smoke and burn with the heat. ",6222,6359
77,The whole top of his huge bulk was turned in a very short time to enormous heaps of ashes. ,6359,6450
78,"It succeeded, however, in cutting the cord with its teeth and freeing the sun, which rolled up again, as round and beautiful as ever, into the wide blue sky. ",6450,6608
79,But the dormouse-or blind woman as it is called-was shrunk away to a very small size. ,6608,6694
80,That is the reason why it is now one of the tiniest creatures upon the earth. ,6694,6772
81,"The little boy returned home when he discovered that the sun had escaped his snare, and devoted himself entirely to hunting. ",6772,6897
82,"""If the beautiful hair of my sister would not hold the sun fast, nothing in the world could,"" he said. ",6897,7000
83,"""He was not born, a little fellow like himself, to look after the sun. ",7000,7071
84,"It required one greater and wiser than he was to regulate that."" ",7071,7136
85,And he went out and shot ten more snow-birds. ,7136,7182
86,"In this business he was very expert, and he had a new bird-skin coat made, which was prettier than the one he had worn before.",7182,7309
