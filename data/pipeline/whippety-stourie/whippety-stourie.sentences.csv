0,"I am going to tell you a story about a poor young widow woman, who lived in a house called Kittlerumpit, though whereabouts in Scotland the house of Kittlerumpit stood nobody knows. ",0,182
1,"Some folk think that it stood in the neighbourhood of the Debateable Land, which, as all the world knows, was on the Borders, where the old Border Reivers were constantly coming and going; ",182,371
2," the Scotch stealing from the English, and the English from the Scotch. ",370,442
3,"Be that as it may, the widowed Mistress of Kittlerumpit was sorely to be pitied. ",442,523
4,"For she had lost her husband, and no one quite knew what had become of him. ",523,599
5,"He had gone to a fair one day, and had never come back again, and although everybody believed that he was dead, no one knew how he died. ",599,736
6,"Some people said that he had been persuaded to enlist, and had been killed in the wars; ",736,824
7," others, that he had been taken away to serve as a sailor by the press-gang, and had been drowned at sea. ",823,929
8,"At any rate, his poor young wife was sorely to be pitied, for she was left with a little baby-boy to bring up, and, as times were bad, she had not much to live on. ",929,1093
9,"But she loved her baby dearly, and worked all day amongst her cows, and pigs, and hens, in order to earn enough money to buy food and clothes for both herself and him. ",1093,1261
10,"Now, on the morning of which I am speaking, she rose very early and went out to feed her pigs, for rent-day was coming on, and she intended to take one of them, a great, big, fat creature, to the market that very day, as she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a long way towards paying her rent. ",1261,1574
11,"And because she thought so, her heart was light, and she hummed a little song to herself as she crossed the yard with her bucket on one arm and her baby-boy on the other. ",1574,1745
12,"But the song was quickly changed into a cry of despair when she reached the pig-stye, for there lay her cherished pig on its back, with its legs in the air and its eyes shut, just as if it were going to breathe its last breath. ",1745,1973
13,"""What shall I do? ",1973,1991
14,"What shall I do?"" ",1991,2009
15,"cried the poor woman, sitting down on a big stone and clasping her boy to her breast, heedless of the fact that she had dropped her bucket, and that the pig's-meat was running out, and that the hens were eating it. ",2009,2224
16,"""First I lost my husband, and now I am going to lose my finest pig. ",2224,2292
17,"The pig that I hoped would fetch a deal of money."" ",2292,2343
18,"Now I must explain to you that the house of Kittlerumpit stood on a hillside, with a great fir wood behind it, and the ground sloping down steeply in front. ",2343,2500
19,"And as the poor young thing, after having a good cry to herself, was drying her eyes, she chanced to look down the hill, and who should she see coming up it but an Old Woman, who looked like a lady born. ",2500,2704
20,"She was dressed all in green, with a white apron, and she wore a black velvet hood on her head, and a steeple-crowned beaver hat over that, something like those, as I have heard tell, that the women wear in Wales. ",2704,2918
21,"She walked very slowly, leaning on a long staff, and she gave a bit hirple now and then, as if she were lame. ",2918,3028
22,"As she drew near, the young widow felt it was becoming to rise and curtsey to the Gentlewoman, for such she saw her to be. ",3028,3151
23,"""Madam,"" she said, with a sob in her voice, ""I bid you welcome to the house of Kittlerumpit, although you find its Mistress one of the most unfortunate women in the world."" ",3151,3324
24,"""Hout-tout,"" answered the old Lady, in such a harsh voice that the young woman started, and grasped her baby tighter in her arms. ",3324,3454
25,"""Ye have little need to say that. ",3454,3488
26,"Ye have lost your husband, I grant ye, but there were waur losses at Shirra-Muir. ",3488,3570
27,"And now your pig is like to die--I could, maybe, remedy that. ",3570,3632
28,"But I must first hear how much ye wad gie me if I cured him."" ",3632,3694
29,"""Anything that your Ladyship's Madam likes to ask,"" replied the widow, too much delighted at having the animal's life saved to think that she was making rather a rash promise. ",3694,3870
30,"""Very good,"" said the old Dame, and without wasting any more words she walked straight into the pig-sty. ",3870,3975
31,"She stood and looked at the dying creature for some minutes, rocking to and fro and muttering to herself in words which the widow could not understand; ",3975,4127
32," at least, she could only understand four of them, and they sounded something like this: ""Pitter-patter, Haly water."" ",4126,4244
33,Then she put her hand into her pocket and drew out a tiny bottle with a liquid that looked like oil in it. ,4244,4351
34,"She took the cork out, and dropped one of her long lady-like fingers into it; ",4351,4429
35," then she touched the pig on the snout and on his ears, and on the tip of his curly tail. ",4428,4518
36,"No sooner had she done so than up the beast jumped, and, with a grunt of contentment, ran off to its trough to look for its breakfast. ",4518,4653
37,"A joyful woman was the Mistress of Kittlerumpit when she saw it do this, for she felt that her rent was safe; ",4653,4763
38," and in her relief and gratitude she would have kissed the hem of the strange Lady's green gown, if she would have allowed it, but she would not. ",4762,4908
39,"""No, no,"" said she, and her voice sounded harsher than ever. ",4908,4969
40,"""Let us have no fine meanderings, but let us stick to our bargain. ",4969,5036
41,"I have done my part, and mended the pig; ",5036,5077
42," now ye must do yours, and give me what I like to ask--your son."" ",5076,5142
43,"Then the poor widow gave a piteous cry, for she knew now what she had not guessed before--that the Green-clad Lady was a Fairy, and a Wicked Fairy too, else had she not asked such a terrible thing. ",5142,5340
44,"It was too late now, however, to pray, and beseech, and beg for mercy; ",5340,5411
45," the Fairy stood her ground, hard and cruel. ",5410,5455
46,"""Ye promised me what I liked to ask, and I have asked your son; ",5455,5519
47," and your son I will have,"" she replied, ""so it is useless making such a din about it. ",5518,5605
48,"But one thing I may tell you, for I know well that the knowledge will not help you. ",5605,5689
49,"By the laws of Fairy-land, I cannot take the bairn till the third day after this, and if by that time you have found out my name I cannot take him even then. ",5689,5847
50,"But ye will not be able to find it out, of that I am certain. ",5847,5909
51,"So I will call back for the boy in three days."" ",5909,5957
52,"And with that she disappeared round the back of the pig-sty, and the poor mother fell down in a dead faint beside the stone. ",5957,6082
53,"All that day, and all the next, she did nothing but sit in her kitchen and cry, and hug her baby tighter in her arms; ",6082,6200
54," but on the day before that on which the Fairy said that she was coming back, she felt as if she must get a little breath of fresh air, so she went for a walk in the fir wood behind the house. ",6199,6392
55,"Now in this fir wood there was an old quarry hole, in the bottom of which was a bonnie spring well, the water of which was always sweet and pure. ",6392,6538
56,"The young widow was walking near this quarry hole, when, to her astonishment, she heard the whirr of a spinning-wheel and the sound of a voice lilting a song. ",6538,6697
57,At first she could not think where the sound came from; ,6697,6753
58," then, remembering the quarry, she laid down her child at a tree root, and crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees to the edge of the hole and peeped over. ",6752,6928
59,She could hardly believe her eyes! ,6928,6963
60,"For there, far below her, at the bottom of the quarry, beside the spring well, sat the cruel Fairy, dressed in her green frock and tall felt hat, spinning away as fast as she could at a tiny spinning-wheel. ",6963,7170
61,"And what should she be singing but-- ""Little kens our guid dame at hame, Whippety-Stourie is my name."" ",7170,7273
62,"The widow woman almost cried aloud for joy, for now she had learned the Fairy's secret, and her child was safe. ",7273,7385
63,"But she dare not, in case the wicked old Dame heard her and threw some other spell over her. ",7385,7478
64,So she crept softly back to the place where she had left her child; ,7478,7546
65," then, catching him up in her arms, she ran through the wood to her house, laughing, and singing, and tossing him in the air in such a state of delight that, if anyone had met her, they would have been in danger of thinking that she was mad. ",7545,7787
66,"Now this young woman had been a merry-hearted maiden, and would have been merry-hearted still, if, since her marriage, she had not had so much trouble that it had made her grow old and sober-minded before her time; ",7787,8002
67, and she began to think what fun it would be to tease the Fairy for a few minutes before she let her know that she had found out her name. ,8001,8140
68,"So next day, at the appointed time, she went out with her boy in her arms, and seated herself on the big stone where she had sat before; ",8140,8277
69," and when she saw the old Dame coming up the hill, she crumpled up her nice clean cap, and screwed up her face, and pretended to be in great distress and to be crying bitterly. ",8276,8453
70,"The Fairy took no notice of this, however, but came close up to her, and said, in her harsh, merciless voice, ""Good wife of Kittlerumpit, ye ken the reason of my coming; ",8453,8623
71," give me the bairn."" ",8622,8643
72,"Then the young mother pretended to be in sorer distress than ever, and fell on her knees before the wicked old woman and begged for mercy. ",8643,8782
73,"""Oh, sweet Madam Mistress,"" she cried, ""spare me my bairn, and take, and thou wilt, the pig instead."" ",8782,8884
74,"""We have no need of bacon where I come from,"" answered the Fairy coldly; ",8884,8957
75," ""so give me the laddie and let me begone--I have no time to waste in this wise."" ",8956,9038
76,"""Oh, dear Lady mine,"" pleaded the Goodwife, ""if thou wilt not have the pig, wilt thou not spare my poor bairn and take me myself?"" ",9038,9169
77,"The Fairy stepped back a little, as if in astonishment. ",9169,9225
78,"""Art thou mad, woman,"" she cried contemptuously, ""that thou proposest such a thing? ",9225,9309
79,"Who in all the world would care to take a plain-looking, red-eyed, dowdy wife like thee with them?"" ",9309,9409
80,"Now the young Mistress of Kittlerumpit knew that she was no beauty, and the knowledge had never vexed her; ",9409,9516
81, but something in the Fairy's tone made her feel so angry that she could contain herself no longer. ,9515,9615
82,"""In troth, fair Madam, I might have had the wit to know that the like of me is not fit to tie the shoe-string of the High and Mighty Princess, WHIPPETY-STOURIE!"" ",9615,9777
83,"If there had been a charge of gunpowder buried in the ground, and if it had suddenly exploded beneath her feet, the Wicked Fairy could not have jumped higher into air. ",9777,9945
84,"And when she came down again she simply turned round and ran down the brae, shrieking with rage and disappointment, for all the world, as an old book says, ""like an owl chased by witches.""",9945,10134
