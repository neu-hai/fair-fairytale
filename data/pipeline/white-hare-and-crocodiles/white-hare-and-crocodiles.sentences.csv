0,"Long, long ago, when all the animals could talk, there lived in the province of Inaba in Japan, a little white hare. ",0,117
1,His home was on the island of Oki. ,117,152
2,Just across the sea was the mainland of Inaba. ,152,199
3,Now the hare wanted very much to cross over to Inaba. ,199,253
4,Day after day he would go out and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of Inaba. ,253,365
5,Day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across. ,365,424
6,"One day as usual, the hare was standing on the beach, looking towards the mainland across the water, when he saw a great crocodile swimming near the island. ",424,581
7,"""This is very lucky!"" ",581,603
8,thought the hare. ,603,621
9,"""Now I shall be able to get my wish. ",621,658
10,"I will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea!"" ",658,712
11,But he was doubtful whether the crocodile would consent to do what wanted. ,712,787
12,So he thought instead of asking a favor he would try to get what he wanted by a trick. ,787,874
13,"So with a loud voice he called to the crocodile, and said: ""Oh, Mr. Crocodile, isn't it a lovely day?"" ",874,977
14,"The crocodile, who had come out all by itself that day to enjoy the bright sunshine, was just beginning to feel a bit lonely when the hare's cheerful greeting broke the silence. ",977,1155
15,"The crocodile swam nearer the shore, very pleased to hear some one speak. ",1155,1229
16,"""I wonder who it was that spoke to me just now! ",1229,1277
17,"Was it you, Mr. Hare? ",1277,1299
18,"You must be very lonely all by yourself!"" ",1299,1341
19,"""Oh, no, I am not at all lonely,"" said the hare, ""but as it was such a fine day I came out here to enjoy myself. ",1341,1454
20,"Won't you stop and play with me a little while?"" ",1454,1503
21,"The crocodile came out of the sea and sat on the shore, and the two played together for some time. ",1503,1602
22,"Then the hare said: ""Mr. Crocodile, you live in the sea and I live on this island. ",1602,1685
23,"We do not often meet, so I know very little about you. ",1685,1740
24,"Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?"" ",1740,1812
25,"""Of course, there are more crocodiles than hares,"" answered the crocodile. ",1812,1887
26,"""Can you not see that for yourself? ",1887,1923
27,"You live on this small island, while I live in the sea, which spreads through all parts of the world. ",1923,2025
28,"If I call together all the crocodiles who dwell in the sea you hares will be as nothing compared to us!"" ",2025,2130
29,The crocodile was very conceited. ,2130,2164
30,"The hare, who meant to play a trick on the crocodile, said: ""Do you think it possible for you to call up enough crocodiles to form a line from this island across the sea to Inaba?"" ",2164,2345
31,"The crocodile thought for a moment and then answered: ""Of course, it is possible."" ",2345,2428
32,"""Then do try,"" said the crafty hare, ""and I will count the number from here!"" ",2428,2506
33,"The crocodile, who was very simple-minded, and who hadn't the least idea that the hare intended to play a trick on him, agreed to do what the hare asked. ",2506,2660
34,"He said: ""Wait a little while I go back into the sea and call my company together!"" ",2660,2744
35,The crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time. ,2744,2807
36,"The hare, meanwhile, waited patiently on the shore. ",2807,2859
37,"At last the crocodile appeared, bringing with him a large number of other crocodiles. ",2859,2945
38,"""Look, Mr. ",2945,2956
39,"Hare!"" ",2956,2963
40,"said the crocodile, ""it is nothing for my friends to form a line between here and Inaba. ",2963,3052
41,There are enough crocodiles to stretch from here even as far as China or India. ,3052,3132
42,"Did you ever see so many crocodiles?"" ",3132,3170
43,Then the whole company of crocodiles arranged themselves in the water so as to form a bridge between the Island of Oki and the mainland of Inaba. ,3170,3316
44,"When the hare saw the bridge of crocodiles, he said: ""How splendid! ",3316,3384
45,I did not believe this was possible. ,3384,3421
46,Now let me count you all! ,3421,3447
47,"To do this, however, with your permission, I must walk over on your backs to the other side. ",3447,3540
48,"Please be so good as not to move, or else I shall fall into the sea and be drowned!"" ",3540,3625
49,"So the hare hopped off the island on to the strange bridge of crocodiles, counting as he jumped from one crocodile's back to the other: ""Please keep quite still, or I shall not be able to count. ",3625,3820
50,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine-"" Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of Inaba. ",3820,3943
51,"Not content with getting his wish, he began to jeer at the crocodiles instead of thanking them. ",3943,4039
52,"He said, as he leapt off the last one's back: ""Oh! ",4039,4090
53,"you stupid crocodiles, now I have done with you!"" ",4090,4140
54,And he was just about to run away as fast as he could. ,4140,4195
55,But he did not escape so easily. ,4195,4228
56,"So soon as the crocodiles understood that this was a trick played upon them by the hare so as to enable him to cross the sea, and that the hare was now laughing at them for their stupidity, they became furiously angry and made up their minds to take revenge. ",4228,4487
57,So some of them ran after the hare and caught him. ,4487,4538
58,Then they all surrounded the poor little animal and pulled out all his fur. ,4538,4614
59,"He cried out loudly and entreated them to spare him, but with each tuft of fur they pulled out they said: ""Serve you right!"" ",4614,4739
60,"When the crocodiles had pulled out the last bit of fur, they threw the poor hare on the beach, and all swam away laughing at what they had done. ",4739,4884
61,"The hare was now in a pitiful plight, all his beautiful white fur had been pulled out. ",4884,4971
62,His bare little body was quivering with pain and bleeding all over. ,4971,5039
63,He could hardly move. ,5039,5061
64,All he could do was to lie on the beach quite helpless and weep over the misfortune that had befallen him. ,5061,5168
65,"Despite that it was his own fault that had brought all this misery and suffering upon the white hare of Inaba, any one seeing the poor little creature could not help feeling sorry for him in his sad condition. ",5168,5378
66,The crocodiles had been very cruel in their revenge. ,5378,5431
67,"Just at this time a number of men, who looked like King's sons, happened to pass by. ",5431,5516
68,"Seeing the hare lying on the beach crying, they stopped and asked what was the matter. ",5516,5603
69,"The hare lifted up his head from between his paws, and answered them, saying: ""I had a fight with some crocodiles, but I was beaten. ",5603,5736
70,"They pulled out all my fur and left me to suffer here-that is why I am crying."" ",5736,5816
71,Now one of these young men had a bad and spiteful disposition. ,5816,5879
72,"But he feigned kindness, and said to the hare: ""I feel very sorry for you. ",5879,5954
73,"If you will only try it, I know of a remedy which will cure your sore body. ",5954,6030
74,"Go and bathe yourself in the sea, and then come and sit in the wind. ",6030,6099
75,"This will make your fur grow again, and you will be just as you were before."" ",6099,6177
76,Then all the young men passed on. ,6177,6211
77,"The hare was very pleased, thinking that he had found a cure. ",6211,6273
78,He went and bathed in the sea and then came out and sat where the wind could blow upon him. ,6273,6365
79,"But as the wind blew and dried him, his skin became drawn and hardened, and the salt increased the pain so much that he rolled on the sand in his agony and cried aloud. ",6365,6534
80,"Just then another King's son passed by, carrying a great bag on his back. ",6534,6608
81,"He saw the hare, and stopped and asked why he was crying so loudly. ",6608,6676
82,"But the poor hare, remembering that he had been deceived by one very like the man who now spoke to him, did not answer, but continued to cry. ",6676,6818
83,"But this man had a kind heart, and looked at the hare very pityingly, and said: ""You poor thing! ",6818,6915
84,I see that your fur is all pulled out and that your skin is quite bare. ,6915,6987
85,"Who can have treated you so cruelly?"" ",6987,7025
86,When the hare heard these kind words he felt very grateful to the man. ,7025,7096
87,Encouraged by his gentle manner the hare told him all that had befallen him. ,7096,7173
88,"The little animal hid nothing from his friend, but told him frankly how he had played a trick on the crocodiles and how he had come across the bridge they had made, thinking that he wished to count their number. ",7173,7385
89,"He told him how he had jeered at them for their stupidity, and then how the crocodiles had revenged themselves on him. ",7385,7504
90,Then he went on to say how he had been deceived by a party of men who looked very like his kind friend. ,7504,7608
91,The hare ended his long tale of woe by begging the man to give him some medicine that would cure him and make his fur grow again. ,7608,7738
92,"When the hare had finished his story, the man was full of pity towards him, and said: ""I am very sorry for all you have suffered, but remember, it was only the consequence of the deceit you practiced on the crocodiles."" ",7738,7958
93,"""I know,"" answered the sorrowful hare, ""but I have repented and made up my mind never to use deceit again. ",7958,8065
94,"I beg you to show me how I may cure my sore body and make the fur grow again."" ",8065,8144
95,"""Then I will tell you of a good remedy,"" said the man. ",8144,8199
96,"""First go and bathe well in that pond over there and try to wash all the salt from your body. ",8199,8293
97,Then pick some of those kaba flowers that are growing near the edge of the water. ,8293,8375
98,Spread them on the ground and roll yourself on them. ,8375,8428
99,"If you do this the pollen will cause your fur to grow again, and you will be quite well in a little while."" ",8428,8536
100,"The hare was very glad to be told what to do, so kindly. ",8536,8593
101,"He crawled to the pond pointed out to him, bathed well in it. ",8593,8655
102,"He then picked the kaba flowers growing near the water, and rolled himself on them. ",8655,8739
103,"To his amazement, even while he was doing this, he saw his nice white fur growing again. ",8739,8828
104,"The pain ceased, and he felt just as he had done before all his misfortunes. ",8828,8905
105,The hare was overjoyed at his quick recovery. ,8905,8951
106,"He went hopping joyfully towards the young man who had so helped him, and kneeling down at his feet, said: ""I cannot express my thanks for all you have done for me! ",8951,9116
107,It is my earnest wish to do something for you in return. ,9116,9173
108,"Please tell me who you are?"" ",9173,9202
109,"""I am no King's son as you think me. ",9202,9239
110,"I am a fairy, and my name is Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto,"" answered the man. ",9239,9310
111,"""Those beings who passed here before me are my brothers. ",9310,9367
112,"They have heard of a beautiful Princess called Yakami who lives in this province of Inaba, and they are on their way to find her and to ask her to marry one of them. ",9367,9533
113,"But on this expedition I am only an attendant, so I am walking behind them with this great big bag on my back."" ",9533,9645
114,"The hare humbled himself before this great fairy Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto, whom many in that part of the land worshiped as a god. ",9645,9772
115,"""Oh, I did not know that you were Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto. ",9772,9829
116,How kind you have been to me! ,9829,9859
117,It is impossible to believe that that unkind fellow who sent me to bathe in the sea is one of your brothers. ,9859,9968
118,"I am quite sure that the Princess, whom your brothers have gone to seek, will refuse to be the bride of any of them. ",9968,10085
119,She will prefer you for your goodness of heart. ,10085,10133
120,"I am quite sure that you will win her heart without intending to do so, and she will ask to be your bride."" ",10133,10241
121,"Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto took no notice of what the hare said, but bidding the little animal goodby, went on his way quickly and soon overtook his brothers. ",10241,10395
122,He found them just entering the Princess's gate. ,10395,10444
123,"Just as the hare had said, the Princess could not be persuaded to become the bride of any of the brothers. ",10444,10551
124,"But when she looked at the kind brother's face she went straight up to him and said: ""To you I give myself,"" and so they were married. ",10551,10686
125,This is the end of the story. ,10686,10716
126,"Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto is worshiped by the people in some parts of Japan, as a god, and the hare has become famous as ""The White Hare of Inaba."" ",10716,10860
127,But what became of the crocodiles nobody knows.,10860,10908
