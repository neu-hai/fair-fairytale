0,"Many, many years ago there lived a good old man who had a wen like a tennis-ball growing out of his right cheek. ",0,113
1,"This lump was a great disfigurement to the old man, and so annoyed him that for many years he spent all his time and money in trying to get rid of it. ",113,264
2,He tried everything he could think of. ,264,303
3,"He consulted many doctors far and near, and took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally. ",303,407
4,But it was all of no use. ,407,433
5,"The lump only grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as big as his face, and in despair he gave up all hopes of ever losing it, and resigned himself to the thought of having to carry the lump on his face all his life. ",433,654
6,"One day the firewood gave out in his kitchen, so, as his wife wanted some at once, the old man took his ax and set out for the woods up among the hills not very far from his home. ",654,834
7,"It was a fine day in the early autumn, and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry to get home. ",834,944
8,"So the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was chopping wood, and he had collected a goodly pile to take back to his wife. ",944,1071
9,"When the day began to draw to a close, he turned his face homewards. ",1071,1140
10,The old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the sky clouded and rain began to fall heavily. ,1140,1256
11,"He looked about for some shelter, but there was not even a charcoal-burner's hut near. ",1256,1343
12,At last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree. ,1343,1405
13,"The hole was near the ground, so he crept in easily, and sat down in hopes that he had only been overtaken by a mountain shower, and that the weather would soon clear. ",1405,1573
14,"But much to the old man's disappointment, instead of clearing the rain fell more and more heavily, and finally a heavy thunderstorm broke over the mountain. ",1573,1730
15,"The thunder roared so terrifically, and the heavens seemed to be so ablaze with lightning, that the old man could hardly believe himself to be alive. ",1730,1880
16,He thought that he must die of fright. ,1880,1919
17,"At last, however, the sky cleared, and the whole country was aglow in the rays of the setting sun. ",1919,2018
18,"The old man's spirits revived when he looked out at the beautiful twilight, and he was about to step out from his strange hiding-place in the hollow tree when the sound of what seemed like the approaching steps of several people caught his ear. ",2018,2263
19,"He at once thought that his friends had come to look for him, and he was delighted at the idea of having some jolly companions with whom to walk home. ",2263,2414
20,"But on looking out from the tree, what was his amazement to see, not his friends, but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot. ",2414,2544
21,"The more he looked, the greater was his astonishment. ",2544,2598
22,"Some of these demons were as large as giants, others had great big eyes out of all proportion to the rest of their bodies, others again had absurdly long noses, and some had such big mouths that they seemed to open from ear to ear. ",2598,2830
23,All had horns growing on their foreheads. ,2830,2872
24,The old man was so surprised at what he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree. ,2872,2974
25,"Fortunately for him the demons did not see him, as the tree was in the background. ",2974,3057
26,So he picked himself up and crept back into the tree. ,3057,3111
27,"While he was sitting there and wondering impatiently when he would be able to get home, he heard the sounds of gay music, and then some of the demons began to sing. ",3111,3276
28,"""What are these creatures doing?"" ",3276,3310
29,said the old man to himself. ,3310,3339
30,"""I will look out, it sounds very amusing."" ",3339,3382
31,"On peeping out, the old man saw that the demon chief himself was actually sitting with his back against the tree in which he had taken refuge, and all the other demons were sitting round, some drinking and some dancing. ",3382,3602
32,"Food and wine was spread before them on the ground, and the demons were evidently having a great entertainment and enjoying themselves immensely. ",3602,3748
33,It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics. ,3748,3803
34,"""How amusing this is!"" ",3803,3826
35,"laughed the old man to himself ""I am now quite old, but I have never seen anything so strange in all my life."" ",3826,3937
36,"He was so interested and excited in watching all that the demons were doing, that he forgot himself and stepped out of the tree and stood looking on. ",3937,4087
37,The demon chief was just taking a big cup of SAKE and watching one of the demons dancing. ,4087,4177
38,"In a little while he said with a bored air: ""Your dance is rather monotonous. ",4177,4255
39,I am tired of watching it. ,4255,4282
40,"Isn't there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow?"" ",4282,4358
41,"Now the old man had been fond of dancing all his life, and was quite an expert in the art, and he knew that he could do much better than the demon. ",4358,4506
42,"""Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do? ",4506,4592
43,"It may be dangerous, for if I don't please them they may kill me!"" ",4592,4659
44,said the old fellow to himself. ,4659,4691
45,"His fears, however, were soon overcome by his love of dancing. ",4691,4754
46,"In a few minutes he could restrain himself no longer, and came out before the whole party of demons and began to dance at once. ",4754,4882
47,"The old man, realizing that his life probably depended on whether he pleased these strange creatures or not, exerted his skill and wit to the utmost. ",4882,5032
48,"The demons were at first very surprised to see a man so fearlessly taking part in their entertainment, and then their surprise soon gave place to admiration. ",5032,5190
49,"""How strange!"" ",5190,5205
50,exclaimed the horned chief. ,5205,5233
51,"""I never saw such a skillful dancer before! ",5233,5277
52,"He dances admirably!"" ",5277,5299
53,"When the old man had finished his dance, the big demon said: ""Thank you very much for your amusing dance. ",5299,5405
54,"Now give us the pleasure of drinking a cup of wine with us,"" and with these words he handed him his largest wine-cup. ",5405,5523
55,"The old man thanked him very humbly: ""I did not expect such kindness from your lordship. ",5523,5612
56,"I fear I have only disturbed your pleasant party by my unskillful dancing."" ",5612,5688
57,"""No, no,"" answered the big demon. ",5688,5722
58,"""You must come often and dance for us. ",5722,5761
59,"Your skill has given us much pleasure."" ",5761,5801
60,The old man thanked him again and promised to do so. ,5801,5854
61,"""Then will you come again to-morrow, old man?"" ",5854,5901
62,asked the demon. ,5901,5918
63,"""Certainly, I will,"" answered the old man. ",5918,5961
64,"""Then you must leave some pledge of your word with us,"" said the demon. ",5961,6033
65,"""Whatever you like,"" said the old man. ",6033,6072
66,"""Now what is the best thing he can leave with us as a pledge?"" ",6072,6135
67,"asked the demon, looking round. ",6135,6167
68,"Then said one of the demon's attendants kneeling behind the chief: ""The token he leaves with us must be the most important thing to him in his possession. ",6167,6322
69,I see the old man has a wen on his right cheek. ,6322,6370
70,Now mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate. ,6370,6421
71,"Let my lord take the lump from the old man's right cheek, and he will surely come to-morrow, if only to get that back."" ",6421,6541
72,"""You are very clever,"" said the demon chief, giving his horns an approving nod. ",6541,6621
73,"Then he stretched out a hairy arm and claw-like hand, and took the great lump from the old man's right cheek. ",6621,6731
74,"Strange to say, it came off as easily as a ripe plum from the tree at the demon's touch, and then the merry troop of demons suddenly vanished. ",6731,6874
75,The old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened. ,6874,6937
76,He hardly knew for some time where he was. ,6937,6980
77,"When he came to understand what had happened to him, he was delighted to find that the lump on his face, which had for so many years disfigured him, had really been taken away without any pain to himself. ",6980,7185
78,"He put up his hand to feel if any scar remained, but found that his right cheek was as smooth as his left. ",7185,7292
79,"The sun had long set, and the young moon had risen like a silver crescent in the sky. ",7292,7378
80,The old man suddenly realized how late it was and began to hurry home. ,7378,7449
81,"He patted his right cheek all the time, as if to make sure of his good fortune in having lost the wen. ",7449,7552
82,He was so happy that he found it impossible to walk quietly--he ran and danced the whole way home. ,7552,7651
83,"He found his wife very anxious, wondering what had happened to make him so late. ",7651,7732
84,He soon told her all that had passed since he left home that afternoon. ,7732,7804
85,"She was quite as happy as her husband when he showed her that the ugly lump had disappeared from his face, for in her youth she had prided herself on his good looks, and it had been a daily grief to her to see the horrid growth. ",7804,8033
86,Now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and disagreeable old man. ,8033,8118
87,"He, too, had for many years been troubled with the growth of a wen on his left cheek, and he, too, had tried all manner of things to get rid of it, but in vain. ",8118,8279
88,"He heard at once, through the servant, of his neighbor's good luck in losing the lump on his face, so he called that very evening and asked his friend to tell him everything that concerned the loss of it. ",8279,8484
89,The good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him. ,8484,8562
90,"He described the place where he would find the hollow tree in which to hide, and advised him to be on the spot in the late afternoon towards the time of sunset. ",8562,8723
91,"The old neighbor started out the very next afternoon, and after hunting about for some time, came to the hollow tree just as his friend had described. ",8723,8874
92,Here he hid himself and waited for the twilight. ,8874,8923
93,"Just as he had been told, the band of demons came at that hour and held a feast with dance and song. ",8923,9024
94,"When this had gone on for some time the chief of the demons looked around and said: ""It is now time for the old man to come as he promised us. ",9024,9167
95,"Why doesn't he come?"" ",9167,9189
96,"When the second old man heard these words he ran out of his hiding-place in the tree and, kneeling down before the Oni, said: ""I have been waiting for a long time for you to speak!"" ",9189,9371
97,"""Ah, you are the old man of yesterday,"" said the demon chief. ",9371,9433
98,"""Thank you for coming, you must dance for us soon."" ",9433,9485
99,The old man now stood up and opened his fan and began to dance. ,9485,9549
100,"But he had never learned to dance, and knew nothing about the necessary gestures and different positions. ",9549,9655
101,"He thought that anything would please the demons, so he just hopped about, waving his arms and stamping his feet, imitating as well as he could any dancing he had ever seen. ",9655,9829
102,"The Oni were very dissatisfied at this exhibition, and said amongst themselves: ""How badly he dances to-day!"" ",9829,9939
103,"Then to the old man the demon chief said: ""Your performance to-day is quite different from the dance of yesterday. ",9939,10054
104,We don't wish to see any more of such dancing. ,10054,10101
105,We will give you back the pledge you left with us. ,10101,10152
106,"You must go away at once."" ",10152,10179
107,"With these words he took out from a fold of his dress the lump which he had taken from the face of the old man who had danced so well the day before, and threw it at the right cheek of the old man who stood before him. ",10179,10398
108,"The lump immediately attached itself to his cheek as firmly as if it had grown there always, and all attempts to pull it off were useless. ",10398,10537
109,"The wicked old man, instead of losing the lump on his left cheek as he had hoped, found to his dismay that he had but added another to his right cheek in his attempt to get rid of the first. ",10537,10728
110,He put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to make sure if he were not dreaming a horrible nightmare. ,10728,10856
111,"No, sure enough there was now a great wen on the right side of his face as on the left. ",10856,10944
112,"The demons had all disappeared, and there was nothing for him to do but to return home. ",10944,11032
113,"He was a pitiful sight, for his face, with the two large lumps, one on each side, looked just like a Japanese gourd.",11032,11149
