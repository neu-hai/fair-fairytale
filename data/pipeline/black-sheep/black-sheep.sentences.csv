0,"It was a bright spring day, and the sun shone very warm and pleasant over the pastures, where the new grass was growing so juicy and tender that all the sheep thought they had never tasted anything so delicious. ",0,212
1,"The sheep had had a strange experience that morning, for the farmer had taken them down to the brook and washed them, and then he tied their legs together and laid them on the grass and clipped all the heavy, soft wool from their bodies with a great pair of shears. ",212,478
2,"The sheep did not like this very well, for every once in a while the shears would pull the wool and hurt them; ",478,589
3," and when they were sheared they felt very strange, for it was almost as if someone took off all your clothes and let you run around naked. ",588,728
4,"None of them were in a very good temper this morning, although the sun shone so warmly and the grass was so sweet, and as they watched the farmer and his man carry their wool up to the house in great bags, the old ram said, crossly, ""I hope they are satisfied, now that they have stolen from us all our soft, warm fleece."" ",728,1051
5,"""What are they going to do with it?"" ",1051,1088
6,asked one of the sheep. ,1088,1112
7,"""Oh, they will spin it into threads and make coats for the men and dresses for the women. ",1112,1202
8,"For men are such strange creatures that no wool grows on them at all, and that is why they selfishly rob us of our fleece that they may cover their own skinny bodies!"" ",1202,1370
9,"""It must be horrid to be a man,"" said the Black Sheep, ""and not to have any wool grow on you at all. ",1370,1471
10,"I'm sorry for that little boy that lives in the lane, for he will never be able to keep warm unless we give him some of our wool."" ",1471,1602
11,"""But what a shame it is,"" continued the ram, ""for the farmer to steal all the wool from us when we have taken all the trouble to grow it!"" ",1602,1741
12,"""I don't mind,"" bleated a young lamb named Frisky, as it kicked up its heels and gambolled about upon the grass; ",1741,1854
13," ""it's nice to have all that heavy wool cut off my back, for I sha'n't have to carry it around wherever I go."" ",1853,1964
14,"""Oh, indeed!"" ",1964,1978
15,"sneered the ram, ""you like it, do you? ",1978,2017
16,"Have you any idea what you look like, all sheared down to your skin? ",2017,2086
17,"How would you like to have someone come along and see you, now that you are all head and legs?"" ",2086,2182
18,"""Oh, I wouldn't mind,"" said the lamb again; ",2182,2226
19," ""I shall grow more wool by winter-time, and I'm sure I don't look any worse than you do."" ",2225,2316
20,"Some of the sheep looked at the ram and began to giggle, for he was old and thin, and looked very comical indeed without any wool. ",2316,2447
21,"And this made him so angry that he went off by himself and began eating grass, and would not speak to the others at all. ",2447,2568
22,"""I don't know why sheep should feel badly about having their fleeces cut,"" remarked the Black Sheep, thoughtfully, ""for the farmer is very kind to us, and so is his dame, and I am glad my wool serves to keep them warm in the winter. ",2568,2801
23,"For before the snow comes our wool will grow out again, and we shall not be any the worse for our loss."" ",2801,2906
24,"""What do those people who haven't any sheep do for clothes?"" ",2906,2967
25,asked the lamb. ,2967,2983
26,"""I'm sure I don't know. ",2983,3007
27,They must nearly freeze in the winter. ,3007,3046
28,"Perhaps the ram can tell us."" ",3046,3076
29,"But the ram was still angry, and refused to say anything, so the sheep stopped talking and began to scatter over the pasture and eat the tender, new grass. ",3076,3232
30,"By and by the Black Sheep wandered near the lane, and looking up, saw the little boy watching it through the bars. ",3232,3347
31,"""Good morning, Black Sheep,"" said the boy; ",3347,3390
32," ""why do you look so funny this morning?"" ",3389,3431
33,"""They have cut off my wool,"" answered the sheep. ",3431,3480
34,"""What will they do with it, Black Sheep?"" ",3480,3522
35,enquired the little boy. ,3522,3547
36,"""They will make coats of it, to keep themselves warm."" ",3547,3602
37,"""I wish I had some wool,"" said the boy, ""for I need a new coat very badly, and mamma is so poor she cannot buy me one."" ",3602,3722
38,"""That is too bad,"" replied the Black Sheep; ",3722,3766
39," ""but I shall have more wool by and by, and then I will give you a bagful to make a new coat from."" ",3765,3865
40,"""Will you really?"" ",3865,3884
41,"asked the boy, looking very much pleased. ",3884,3926
42,"""Indeed I will,"" answered the sheep, ""for you are always kind and have a pleasant word for me. ",3926,4021
43,"So you watch until my wool grows again, and then you shall have your share of it."" ",4021,4104
44,"""Oh, thank you!"" ",4104,4121
45,"said the boy, and he ran away to tell his mother what the Black Sheep had said. ",4121,4201
46,"When the farmer came into the field again the Black Sheep said to him, ""Master, how many bags of wool did you cut from my back?"" ",4201,4330
47,"""Two bags full,"" replied the farmer; ",4330,4367
48," ""and it was very nice wool indeed."" ",4366,4403
49,"""If I grow three bags full the next time, may I have one bag for myself?"" ",4403,4477
50,asked the sheep. ,4477,4494
51,"""Why, what could you do with a bag of wool?"" ",4494,4539
52,questioned the farmer. ,4539,4562
53,"""I want to give it to the little boy that lives in the lane. ",4562,4623
54,"He is very poor and needs a new coat."" ",4623,4662
55,"""Very well,"" answered the master; ",4662,4696
56," ""if you can grow three bags full I will give one to the little boy."" ",4695,4765
57,"So the Black Sheep began to grow wool, and tried in every way to grow the finest and heaviest fleece in all the flock. ",4765,4884
58,"She always lay in the sunniest part of the pastures, and drank from the clearest part of the brook, and ate only the young and juicy shoots of grass and the tenderest of the sheep-sorrel. ",4884,5072
59,And each day the little boy came to the bars and looked at the sheep and enquired how the wool was growing. ,5072,5180
60,"""I am getting along finely,"" the Black Sheep would answer, ""for not one sheep in the pasture has so much wool as I have grown already."" ",5180,5316
61,"""Can I do anything to help you?"" ",5316,5349
62,asked the little boy. ,5349,5371
63,"""Not that I think of,"" replied the sheep, ""unless you could get me a little salt. ",5371,5453
64,"I believe salt helps the wool to grow."" ",5453,5493
65,"So the boy ran to the house and begged his mother for a handful of salt, and then he came back to the bars, where the Black Sheep licked it out of his hand. ",5493,5650
66,"Day by day the wool on the sheep grew longer and longer, and even the old ram noticed it and said, ""You are foolish to grow so much wool, for the farmer will cut it all off, and it will do you no good. ",5650,5852
67,"Now I am growing just as little as possible, for since he steals what I have I am determined he shall get very little wool from my back."" ",5852,5990
68,"Black Sheep did not reply to this, for she thought the old ram very ill-tempered and selfish, and believed he was doing wrong not to grow more wool. ",5990,6139
69,"Finally the time came to shear the sheep again, and the farmer and his man came into the pasture to look at them, and were surprised to see what a fine, big fleece the Black Sheep had grown. ",6139,6330
70,"""There will be three bagsful at the least,"" said the master, ""and I will keep my promise and give one to the little boy in the lane. ",6330,6463
71,"But, my goodness! ",6463,6481
72,how scraggly and poor the old ram looks. ,6481,6522
73,There is scarcely any wool on him at all. ,6522,6564
74,"I think I must sell him to the butcher!"" ",6564,6605
75,"And, in truth, although the ram kicked and struggled and bleated with rage, they tied his legs and put him into the cart and carried him away to the butcher. ",6605,6763
76,And that was the last the sheep ever saw of him. ,6763,6812
77,But the Black Sheep ran up to the bars by the lane and waited with a glad heart till the little boy came. ,6812,6918
78,"When he saw the sheep waiting for him he asked, ""Black Sheep, Black Sheep, have you any wool?"" ",6918,7013
79,"And the sheep replied, ""Yes my little master, three bags full!"" ",7013,7077
80,"""That is fine!"" ",7077,7093
81,said the boy; ,3376,3390
82," ""but who are the three bags for?"" ",7106,7141
83,"""One for my master, one for his dame, And one for the little boy that lives in the lane."" ",7141,7231
84,"""Thank you, Black Sheep,"" said the little boy; ",7231,7278
85," ""you are very kind, and I shall always think of you when I wear my new coat."" ",7277,7356
86,"The next day the sheep were all sheared, and the Black Sheep's fleece made three big bagsful. ",7356,7450
87,"The farmer kept his promise and carried one bag to the little boy that lived in the lane, and the wool was so soft and so heavy that there was enough not only for the new coat, but to make his mother a warm dress as well. ",7450,7672
88,The Black Sheep was very proud and happy when the mother and her little boy came down to the bars and showed the new clothes that had been made from the wool. ,7672,7831
89,"""This pays me for all my trouble,"" said the Black Sheep, and the little boy reached his hand through the bars and patted her gently upon the head.",7831,7978
