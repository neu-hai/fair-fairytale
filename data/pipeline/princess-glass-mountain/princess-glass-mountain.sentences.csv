0,"Once upon a time there was a king who took such a joy in the chase, that he knew no greater pleasure than hunting wild beasts. ",0,127
1,"Early and late he camped in the forest with hawk and hound, and good fortune always followed his hunting. ",127,233
2,"But it chanced one day that he could rouse no game, although he had tried in every direction since morning. ",233,341
3,"And then, when evening was coming on, and he was about to ride home, he saw a dwarf or wild man running through the forest before him. ",341,476
4,"The king at once spurred on his horse, rode after the dwarf, seized him and he was surprised at his strange appearance; ",476,596
5," for he was small and ugly, like a troll, and his hair was as stiff as bean-straw. ",595,678
6,"But no matter what the king said to him, he would return no answer, nor say a single word one way or another. ",678,788
7,"This angered the king, who was already out of sorts because of his ill-success at the hunt, and he ordered his people to seize the wild man and guard him carefully lest he escape. ",788,968
8,Then the king rode home. ,968,993
9,"Now his people said to him: ""You should keep the wild man a captive here at your court, in order that the whole country may talk of what a mighty huntsman you are. ",993,1157
10,Only you should guard him so that he does not escape; ,1157,1211
11," because he is of a sly and treacherous disposition."" ",1210,1264
12,When the king had listened to them he said nothing for a long time. ,1264,1332
13,"Then he replied: ""I will do as you say, and if the wild man escape, it shall be no fault of mine. ",1332,1430
14,"But I vow that whoever lets him go shall die without mercy, and though he were my own son!"" ",1430,1522
15,"The following morning, as soon as the king awoke, he remembered his vow. ",1522,1595
16,"He at once sent for wood and beams, and had a small house or cage built quite close to the castle. ",1595,1694
17,"The small house was built of great timbers, and protected by strong locks and bolts, so that none could break in; ",1694,1808
18, and a peephole was left in the middle of the wall through which food might be thrust. ,1807,1894
19,"When everything was completed the king had the wild man led up, placed in the small house, and he himself took and kept the key. ",1894,2023
20,"There the dwarf had to sit a prisoner, day and night, and the people came afoot and a-horseback to gaze at him. ",2023,2135
21,"Yet no one ever heard him complain, or so much as utter a single word. ",2135,2206
22,Thus matters went for some time. ,2206,2239
23,"Then a war broke out in the land, and the king had to take the field. ",2239,2309
24,"At parting he said to the queen: ""You must rule the kingdom now in my stead, and I leave land and people in your care. ",2309,2428
25,"But there is one thing you must promise me you will do: that you will guard the wild man securely so that he does not escape while I am away."" ",2428,2571
26,"The queen promised to do her best in all respects, and the king gave her the key to the cage. ",2571,2665
27,"Thereupon he had his long galleys, his ""sea-wolves,"" push out from the shore, hoisted sail, and took his course far, far away to the other country. ",2665,2813
28,"The king and queen had only one child, a prince who was still small; ",2813,2882
29, yet great in promise. ,2881,2904
30,"Now when the king had gone, it chanced one day that the little fellow was wandering about the royal courtyard, and came to the wild man's cage. ",2904,3048
31,And he began to play with an apple of gold he had. ,3048,3099
32,"And while he was playing with it, it happened that suddenly the apple fell through the window in the wall of the cage. ",3099,3218
33,The wild man at once appeared and threw back the apple. ,3218,3274
34,"This seemed a merry game to the little fellow: he threw the apple in again, and the wild man threw it out again, and thus they played for a long time. ",3274,3425
35,"Yet for all the game had been so pleasant, it turned to sorrow in the end: for the wild man kept the apple of gold, and would not give it back again. ",3425,3575
36,"And when all was of no avail, neither threats nor prayers, the little fellow at last began to weep. ",3575,3675
37,"Then the wild man said: ""Your father did ill to capture me, and you will never get your apple of gold again, unless you let me out."" ",3675,3808
38,"The little fellow answered: ""And how can I let you out? ",3808,3864
39,"Just you give me back my apple again, my apple of gold!"" ",3864,3921
40,"Then the wild man said: ""You must do what I now tell you. ",3921,3979
41,"Go up to your mother, the queen, and beg her to comb your hair. ",3979,4043
42,"Then see to it that you take the key from her girdle, and come down and unlock the door. ",4043,4132
43,"After that you can return the key in the same way, without any one knowing anything about it."" ",4132,4227
44,"After the wild man had talked to the boy in this way, he finally did as he said, went up to his mother, begged her to comb his hair, and took the key from her girdle. ",4227,4394
45,Then he ran down to the cage and opened the door. ,4394,4444
46,"And when they parted, the dwarf said: ""Here is your apple of gold, that I promised to give back to you, and I thank you for setting me free. ",4444,4585
47,"And another time when you have need of me, I will help you in turn."" ",4585,4654
48,And with that he ran off on his own way. ,4654,4695
49,"But the prince went back to his mother, and returned the key in the same way he had taken it. ",4695,4789
50,"When they learned at the king's court that the wild man had broken out, there was great commotion, and the queen sent people over hill and dale to look for him. ",4789,4950
51,But he was gone and he stayed gone. ,4950,4986
52,Thus matters went for a while and the queen grew more and more unhappy; ,4986,5058
53, for she expected her husband to return every day. ,5057,5108
54,And when he did reach shore his first question was whether the wild man had been well guarded. ,5108,5203
55,"Then the queen had to confess how matters stood, and told him how everything had happened. ",5203,5294
56,"But the king was enraged beyond measure, and said he would punish the malefactor, no matter who he might be. ",5294,5403
57,"And he ordered a great investigation at his court, and every human being in it had to testify. ",5403,5498
58,But no one knew anything. ,5498,5524
59,At last the little prince also had to come forward. ,5524,5576
60,"And as he stood before the king he said: ""I know that I have deserved my father's anger; ",5576,5665
61, yet I cannot hide the truth; ,5664,5694
62," for I let out the wild man."" ",5693,5723
63,"Then the queen turned white, and the others as well, for there was not one who was not fond of the prince. ",5723,5830
64,"At last the king spoke: ""Never shall it be said of me that I was false to my vow, even for the sake of my own flesh and blood! ",5830,5957
65,"No, you must die the death you have deserved."" ",5957,6004
66,And with that he gave the order to take the prince to the forest and kill him. ,6004,6083
67,And they were to bring back the boy's heart as a sign that his command had been obeyed. ,6083,6171
68,"Now sorrow unheard of reigned among the people, and all pleaded for the little prince. ",6171,6258
69,But the king's word could not be recalled. ,6258,6301
70,"His serving-men did not dare disobey, took the boy in their midst, and set forth. ",6301,6383
71,"And when they had gone a long way into the forest, they saw a swine-herd tending his pigs. ",6383,6474
72,"Then one said to another: ""It does not seem right to me to lay hand on the king's son; ",6474,6561
73," let us buy a pig instead and take its heart, then all will believe it is the heart of the prince."" ",6560,6660
74,"The other serving-men thought that he spoke wisely, so they bought a pig from the swine-herd, led it into the wood, butchered it and took its heart. ",6660,6809
75,Then they told the prince to go his way and never return. ,6809,6867
76,"They themselves went back to the king's castle, and it is easy to imagine what grief they caused when they told of the prince's death. ",6867,7002
77,The king's son did what the serving-men had told him. ,7002,7056
78,"He kept on wandering as far as he could, and never had any other food than the nuts and wild berries that grow in the forest. ",7056,7182
79,"And when he had wandered far and long, he came to a mountain upon whose very top stood a fir-tree. ",7182,7281
80,"Said he to himself: ""After all, I might as well climb the fir-tree and see whether I can find a path anywhere."" ",7281,7393
81,No sooner said than done: he climbed the tree. ,7393,7440
82,"And as he sat in the very top of its crown, and looked about on every side, he saw a large and splendid royal castle rising in the distance, and gleaming in the sun. ",7440,7606
83,Then he grew very happy and at once set forth in that direction. ,7606,7671
84,"On the way he met a farm-hand who was ploughing, and begged him to change clothes with him, which he did. ",7671,7777
85,"Thus fitted out he at last reached the king's castle, went in, asked for a place, and was taken on as a herdsman, to tend the king's cattle. ",7777,7918
86,"Now he went to the forest early and late, and in the course of time forgot his grief, grew up, and became so tall and brave that his equal could not be found. ",7918,8077
87,And now our story turns to the king who was reigning at the splendid castle. ,8077,8154
88,"He had been married, and he had an only daughter. ",8154,8204
89,"She was lovelier by far than other maidens, and had so kind and cheerful a disposition that whoever could some day take her to his home might well consider himself fortunate. ",8204,8379
90,"Now when the princess had completed her fifteenth year, a quite unheard of swarm of suitors made their appearance, as may well be imagined; ",8379,8519
91," and for all that she said no to all of them, they only increased in number. ",8518,8595
92,"At last the princess said: ""None other shall win me save he who can ride up the high Glass Mountain in full armor!"" ",8595,8711
93,The king thought this a good suggestion. ,8711,8752
94,"He approved of his daughter's wish, and had proclaimed throughout the kingdom that none other should have the princess save he who could ride up the Glass Mountain. ",8752,8917
95,"And when the day set by the king had arrived, the princess was led up the Glass Mountain. ",8917,9007
96,"There she sat on its highest peak, with a golden crown on her head, and a golden apple in her hand, and she looked so immeasurably lovely that there was no one who would not have liked to risk his life for her. ",9007,9218
97,"Just below the foot of the hill all the suitors assembled with splendid horses and glittering armor, that shone like fire in the sun, and from round about the people flocked together in great crowds to watch their tilting. ",9218,9441
98,"And when everything was ready, the signal was given by horns and trumpets, and then the suitors, one after another, raced up the mountain with all their might. ",9441,9601
99,"But the mountain was high, as slippery as ice, and besides it was steep beyond all measure. ",9601,9693
100,"Not one of the suitors rode up more than a little way, before he tumbled down again, head over heels, and it might well happen that arms and legs were broken in the process. ",9693,9867
101,"This made so great a noise, together with the neighing of the horses, the shouting of the people, and the clash of arms, that the tumult and the shouting could be heard far away. ",9867,10046
102,"And while all this was going on, the king's son was rambling about with his oxen, deep in the wood. ",10046,10146
103,"But when he heard the tumult and the clashing of arms, he sat down on a stone, leaned his cheek on his hand, and became lost in thought. ",10146,10283
104,For it had occurred to him how gladly he would have fared forth with the rest. ,10283,10362
105,"Suddenly he heard footsteps and when he looked up, the wild man was standing before him. ",10362,10451
106,"""Thank you for the last time!"" ",10451,10482
107,"said he, ""and why do you sit here so lonely and full of sorrow?"" ",10482,10547
108,"""Well,"" said the prince, ""I have no choice but to be sad and joyless. ",10547,10617
109,"Because of you I am a fugitive from the land of my father, and now I have not even a horse and armor to ride up the Glass Mountain and fight for the princess."" ",10617,10777
110,"""Ah,"" said the wild man, ""if that be all you want, then I can help you! ",10777,10849
111,"You helped me once before and now I will help you in turn."" ",10849,10909
112,"Then he took the prince by the hand, led him deep down into the earth into his cave, and behold, there hung a suit of armor forged out of the hardest steel, and so bright that a blue gleam played all around it. ",10909,11120
113,"Right beside it stood a splendid steed, saddled and bridled, pawing the earth with his steel hoofs, and champing his bit till the white foam dropped to the ground. ",11120,11284
114,"The wild man said: ""Now get quickly into your armor, ride out and try your luck! ",11284,11365
115,"In the meantime I will tend your oxen."" ",11365,11405
116,The prince did not wait to be told a second time; ,11405,11455
117," but put on helmet and armor, buckled on his spurs, hung his sword at his side, and felt as light in his steel armor as a bird in the air. ",11454,11593
118,"Then he leaped into the saddle so that every clasp and buckle rang, laid his reins on the neck of his steed, and rode hastily toward the mountain. ",11593,11740
119,"The princess's suitors were about to give up the contest, for none of them had won the prize, though each had done his best. ",11740,11865
120,"And while they stood there thinking it over, and saying that perhaps fortune would favor them another time, they suddenly saw a youth ride out of the wood straight toward the mountain. ",11865,12050
121,"He was clad in steel from head to foot, with helmet on head, sword in belt and shield on arm, and he sat his horse with such knightly grace that it was a pleasure to look at him. ",12050,12229
122,"At once all eyes were turned to the strange knight, and all asked who he might be; ",12229,12312
123, for none had ever seen him before. ,12311,12347
124,"Yet they had had but little time to talk and question, for no sooner had he cleared the wood, than he rose in his stirrups, gave his horse the spurs, and shot forward like an arrow straight up the Glass Mountain. ",12347,12560
125,Yet he did not ride up all the way; ,12560,12596
126," but when he had reached the middle of the steep ascent, he suddenly flung around his steed and rode down again, so that the sparks flew from his horse's hoofs. ",12595,12756
127,Then he disappeared in the wood like a bird in flight. ,12756,12811
128,"One may imagine the excitement which now seized upon all the people, and there was not one who did not admire the strange knight. ",12811,12941
129,All agreed they had never seen a braver knight. ,12941,12989
130,"Time passed, and the princess's suitors decided to try their luck a second time. ",12989,13070
131,"The king's daughter was once more led up the Glass Mountain, with great pomp and richly gowned, and was seated on its topmost peak, with the golden crown on her head, and a golden apple in her hand. ",13070,13269
132,"At the foot of the hill gathered all the suitors with handsome horses and splendid armor, and round about stood all the people to watch the contest. ",13269,13418
133,"When all was ready the signal was given by horns and trumpets, and at the same moment the suitors, one after another, darted up the mountain with all their might. ",13418,13581
134,But all took place as at the first time. ,13581,13622
135,"The mountain was high, and as slippery as ice, and besides, it was steep beyond all measure; ",13622,13715
136, not one rode up more than a little way before tumbling down again head over heels. ,13714,13798
137,"Meanwhile there was much noise, and the horses neighed, and the people shouted, and the armor clashed, so that the tumult and the shouting sounded far into the deep wood. ",13798,13969
138,"And while all this was going on, the young prince was tending his oxen, which was his duty. ",13969,14061
139,"But when he heard the tumult and the clashing of arms, he sat down on a stone, leaned his cheek on his hand, and wept; ",14061,14180
140," for he thought of the king's beautiful daughter, and it occurred to him how much he would like to take part and ride with the rest. ",14179,14312
141,"That very moment he heard footsteps and when he looked up, the wild man was standing before him. ",14312,14409
142,"""Good-day!"" ",14409,14421
143,"said the wild man, ""and why do you sit here so lonely and full of sorrow?"" ",14421,14496
144,"Thereupon the prince replied: ""I have no choice but to be sad and joyless. ",14496,14571
145,"Because of you I am a fugitive from the land of my father, and now I have not even a horse and armor to ride up the mountain and fight for the princess!"" ",14571,14725
146,"""Ah,"" said the wild man, ""if that be all you want, then I can help you! ",10777,10849
147,"You helped me once before, and now I will help you in turn."" ",14797,14858
148,"Then he took the prince by the hand, led him deep down in the earth into his cave, and there on the wall hung a suit of armor altogether forged of the clearest silver, and so bright that it shone afar. ",14858,15060
149,"Right beside it stood a snow-white steed, saddled and bridled, pawing the earth with his silver hoofs, and champing his bit till the foam dropped to the ground. ",15060,15221
150,"The wild man said: ""Now get quickly into your armor, ride out and try your luck! ",11284,11365
151,"In the meantime I will tend your oxen."" ",11365,11405
152,The prince did not wait to be told a second time; ,11405,11455
153," but put on his helmet and armor in all haste, securely buckled on his spurs, hung his sword at his side, and felt as light in his silver armor as a bird in the air. ",15391,15557
154,"Then he leaped into the saddle so that every clasp and buckle rang, laid his reins on the neck of his steed, and rode hastily toward the Glass Mountain. ",15557,15710
155,"The princess's suitors were about to give over the contest, for none of them had won the prize, though each had played a man's part. ",15710,15843
156,"And while they stood there thinking it over, and saying that perhaps fortune would favor them the next time, they suddenly saw a youth ride out of the wood, straight toward the mountain. ",15843,16030
157,"He was clad in silver from head to foot, with helmet on head, shield on arm, and sword at side, and he sat his horse with such knightly grace that a braver-looking youth had probably never been seen. ",16030,16230
158,"At once all eyes were turned toward him, and the people noticed that he was the same knight who had appeared before. ",16230,16347
159,But the prince did not leave them much time for wonderment; ,16347,16407
160," for no sooner had he reached the plain, than he rose in his stirrups, spurred on his horse, and rode like fire straight up the steep mountain. ",16406,16550
161,Yet he did not ride quite up to the top; ,16550,16591
162," but when he had come to its crest, he greeted the princess with great courtesy, flung about his steed, and rode down the mountain again till the sparks flew about his horse's hoofs. ",16590,16773
163,Then he disappeared into the wood as the storm flies. ,16773,16827
164,"As one may imagine, the people's excitement was even greater than the first time, and there was not one who did not admire the strange knight. ",16827,16970
165,And all were agreed that a more splendid steed or a handsomer youth were nowhere to be found. ,16970,17064
166,"Time passed, and the king set a day when his daughter's suitors were to make a third trial. ",17064,17156
167,"The princess was now once more led to the Glass Mountain, and seated herself on its highest peak, with the golden crown and the golden apple, as she had before. ",17156,17317
168,"At the foot of the mountain gathered the whole swarm of suitors, with splendid horses and polished armor, handsome beyond anything seen thus far, and round about the people flocked together to watch the contest. ",17317,17529
169,"When all was ready the suitors, one after another, darted up the mountain with all their might. ",17529,17625
170,"The mountain was as smooth as ice, and besides, it was steep beyond all measure; ",17625,17706
171," so that not one rode up more than a little way, before tumbling down again, head over heels. ",17705,17799
172,"This made a great noise, the horses neighed, the people shouted, and the armor clashed, till the tumult and the shouting echoed far into the wood. ",17799,17946
173,While this was all taking place the king's son was busy tending his oxen as usual. ,17946,18029
174,"And when he once more heard the noise and the clash of arms, he sat down on a stone, leaned his cheek on his hand, and wept bitterly. ",18029,18163
175,"Then he thought of the lovely princess, and would gladly have ventured his life to win her. ",18163,18255
176,"That very moment the wild man was standing before him: ""Good-day!"" ",18255,18322
177,"said the wild man, ""And why do you sit here so lonely and full of sorrow?"" ",18322,18397
178,"""I have no choice but to be sad and joyless,"" said the prince. ",18397,18460
179,"""Because of you I am a fugitive from the land of my father, and now I have not even a sword and armor to ride up the mountain and fight for the princess!"" ",18460,18615
180,"""Ah,"" said the wild man, ""if that be all that troubles you I can help you! ",18615,18690
181,"You helped me once before, and now I will help you in turn."" ",14797,14858
182,"With that he took the prince by the hand, led him into his cave deep down under the earth, and showed him a suit of armor all forged of the purest gold, and gleaming so brightly that its golden glow shone far and wide. ",18751,18970
183,"Beside it stood a magnificent steed, saddled and bridled, pawing the earth with its golden hoofs, and champing its bit until the foam fell to the ground. ",18970,19124
184,"The wild man said: ""Now get quickly into your armor, ride out and try your luck! ",11284,11365
185,"In the meantime I will tend your oxen."" ",11365,11405
186,"And to tell the truth, the prince was not lazy; ",19245,19293
187," but put on his helmet and armor, buckled on his golden spurs, hung his sword at his side, and felt as light in his golden armor as a bird in the air. ",19292,19443
188,"Then he leaped into the saddle, so that every clasp and buckle rang, laid his reins on the neck of his steed, and rode hastily toward the mountain. ",19443,19591
189,The princess's suitors were about to give up the contest; ,19591,19649
190," for none of them had won the prize, though each had done his best. ",11797,11865
191,"And while they stood there thinking over what was to be done, they suddenly saw a youth come riding out of the wood, straight toward the mountain. ",19716,19863
192,"He was clad in gold from head to foot, with the golden helmet on his head, the golden shield on his arm, and the golden sword at his side, and so knightly was his bearing that a bolder warrior could not have been met with in all the wide world. ",19863,20108
193,"At once all eyes were turned toward him, and one could see that he was the same youth who had already appeared at different times. ",20108,20239
194,But the prince gave them but little time to question and wonder; ,20239,20304
195," for no sooner had he reached the plain than he gave his horse the spurs, and shot up the steep mountain like a flash of lightning. ",20303,20435
196,"When he had reached its highest peak, he greeted the beautiful princess with great courtesy, kneeled before her, and received the golden apple from her hand. ",20435,20593
197,"Then he flung about his steed, and rode down the Glass Mountain again, so that the sparks flew about the golden hoofs of his horse, and a long ribbon of golden light gleamed behind him. ",20593,20779
198,At last he disappeared in the wood like a star. ,20779,20827
199,What a commotion now reigned about the mountain! ,20827,20876
200,"The people broke forth into cheers that could be heard far away, horns sounded, trumpets called, horses neighed, arms clashed, and the king had proclaimed far and near that the unknown golden knight had won the prize. ",20876,21094
201,Now all that was wanting was some information about the golden knight; ,21094,21165
202, for no one knew him; ,21164,21186
203, and all the people expected that he would at once make his appearance at the castle. ,21185,21271
204,But he did not come. ,21271,21292
205,"This caused great surprise, and the princess grew pale and ill. ",21292,21356
206,"But the king was put out, and the suitors murmured and found fault day by day. ",21356,21435
207,"And at length, when they were all at their wits' end, the king had a great meeting announced at his castle, which every man, high and low, was to attend; ",21435,21589
208, so that the princess might choose among them herself. ,21588,21643
209,"There was no one who was not glad to go for the princess's sake, and also because it was a royal command, and a countless number of people gathered together. ",21643,21801
210,"And when they had all assembled, the princess came out of the castle with great pomp, and followed by her maids, passed through the entire multitude. ",21801,21951
211,"But no matter how much she looked about her on every side, she did not find the one for whom she was looking. ",21951,22061
212,When she reached the last row she saw a man who stood quite hidden by the crowd. ,22061,22142
213,He had a flat cap and a wide gray mantle such as shepherds wear; ,22142,22207
214, but its hood was drawn up so that his face could not be seen. ,22206,22269
215,"At once the princess ran up to him, drew down his hood, fell upon his neck and cried: ""Here he is! ",22269,22368
216,"Here he is!"" ",22368,22381
217,Then all the people laughed; ,22381,22410
218," for they saw that it was the king's herdsman, and the king himself called out: ""May God console me for the son-in-law who is to be my portion!"" ",22409,22554
219,"The man, however, was not at all abashed, but replied: ""O, you need not worry about that at all! ",22554,22651
220,"I am just as much a king's son as you are a king!"" ",22651,22702
221,With that he flung aside his wide mantle. ,22702,22744
222,And there were none left to laugh; ,22744,22779
223," for instead of the grey herdsman, there stood a handsome prince, clad in gold from head to foot, and holding the princess's golden apple in his hand. ",22778,22929
224,And all could see that it was the same youth who had ridden up the Glass Mountain. ,22929,23012
225,"Then they prepared a feast whose like had never before been seen, and the prince received the king's daughter, and with her half of the kingdom. ",23012,23157
226,"Thenceforward they lived happily in their kingdom, and if they have not died they are living there still. ",23157,23263
227,But nothing more was ever heard of the wild man. ,23263,23312
228,And that is the end.,23312,23333
