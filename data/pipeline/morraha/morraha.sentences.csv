79,"Niall followed him, and as he was passing the gate cut away the saddle from under him and the clothes from his back. ",7422,7539
80,"Then his mother said to Niall: ""Whatever fool it is that's mocking you, he is out yonder in the little currach, going home; ",7539,7663
81," and take good heed to yourself, and don't sleep one wink for three days."" ",7662,7737

97,"I thought no one would ever get it, but now it will be heard by all."" ",8701,8771
98,"When I was growing up my mother taught me the language of the birds, and when I got married I used to be listening to their conversation. ",8771,8909
99,"I would be laughing, and my wife would be asking me what was the reason of my laughing. ",8909,8997
100,"I did not like to tell her, as women are always asking questions. ",8997,9063
101,"We went out walking one fine morning, and the birds were arguing with one another. ",9063,9146
102,"One of them said to another: ""Why should you be making comparison with me, when there is not a king nor knight that does not come to look at my tree?"" ",9146,9297
103,"""Oh, what advantage has your tree over mine, on which there are three rods of magic and mastery growing?"" ",9297,9403
104,"When I heard them arguing, and knew that the rods were there, I began to laugh. ",9403,9483
105,"""Oh,"" said my wife, ""why are you always laughing? ",9483,9533

110,"She was greatly delighted, and she asked me to go home, and she gave orders to the cook to have breakfast ready at six o'clock in the morning. ",9770,9913
111,"I did not know why she was going out early, and breakfast was ready in the morning at the hour she appointed. ",9913,10023
112,She asked me to go out walking. ,10023,10055
113,I went with her. ,10055,10072
114,"She went to the tree, and asked me to cut a rod for her. ",10072,10129

117,"""I will not leave this till I get the rod, to see if there is any good in it."" ",10184,10263
118,"I cut the rod, and gave it to her. ",10263,10298
119,"She turned from me, and struck a blow on a stone and changed it. ",10298,10363
120,"She struck a second blow on me, and made of me a black raven, and she went home, and left me after her. ",10363,10467
121,I thought she would come back. ,10467,10498
122,"She did not come, and I had to go into a tree till morning. ",10498,10558
123,"In the morning, at six o'clock, there was a bellman out, proclaiming that everyone who killed a raven would get a fourpenny bit. ",10558,10687
124,"At last you would not find man or boy without a gun, nor, if you were to walk three miles, a raven that was not killed. ",10687,10807
125,"I had to make a nest in the top of the parlour chimney, and hide myself all day till night came, and go out to pick up a bit to support me, till I spent a month. ",10807,10969
126,Here she is herself (to say) if it is a lie I am telling. ,10969,11027
127,"""It is not,"" said she. ",11027,11050
128,Then I saw her out walking. ,11050,11078
129,"I went up to her, and I thought she would turn me back to my own shape, and she struck me with the rod and made of me an old white horse. ",11078,11216
130,She ordered me to be put to a cart with a man to draw stones from morning till night. ,11216,11302
131,I was worse off then. ,11302,11324
132,"She spread abroad a report that I had died suddenly in my bed, and prepared a coffin, and waked me, and buried me. ",11324,11439
133,Then she had no trouble. ,11439,11464
134,"But when I got tired, I began to kill everyone who came near me, and I used to go into the haggard every night and destroy the stacks of corn. ",11464,11607
135,"When a man came near me in the morning, I would follow him till I broke his bones. ",11607,11690
136,Everyone got afraid of me. ,11690,11717
137,"When she saw I was doing mischief, she came to meet me, and I thought she would change me. ",11717,11808
138,"And she did change me, and made a fox of me. ",11808,11853
139,"When I saw she was doing me every sort of damage, I went away from her. ",11853,11925
140,"I knew there was a badger's hole in the garden, and I went there till night came, and I made great slaughter among the ducks and geese. ",11925,12061
141,There she is herself to say if I am telling a lie. ,12061,12112
142,"""Oh, you are telling nothing but the truth, only less than the truth."" ",12112,12183
143,"When she had enough of my killing the fowl, she came out into the garden, for she knew I was in the badger's hole. ",12183,12298
144,"She came to me, and made me a wolf. ",12298,12334
145,"I had to be off, and go to an island, where no one at all would see me, and now and then I used to be killing sheep, for there were not many of them, and I was afraid of being seen and hunted; ",12334,12527
146," and so I passed a year, till a shepherd saw me among the sheep, and a pursuit was made after me. ",12526,12624
147,"And when the dogs came near me, there was no place for me to escape to from them; ",12624,12706
148," but I recognised the sign of the King among the men, and I made for him, and the King cried out to stop the hounds. ",12705,12822

153,"And the King took me home with him, and gave orders that I should be well cared for. ",13020,13105
154,I was so wise when I got food I would not eat one morsel until I got a knife and fork. ,13105,13192
155,"The man told the King, and the King came to see if it was true, and I got a knife and fork, and I took the knife in one paw and the fork in the other, and I bowed to the King. ",13192,13368

161,"Perhaps he will serve us yet."" ",13663,13694
162,And this is the sort of King he was--a King who had not a child living. ,13694,13766

170,"A coupling was put between me and the cradle, and when everyone went to sleep I was watching till the person woke who attended in the daytime; ",14270,14413
171," but I was there only two nights when, it was near the day, I saw the hand coming down through the chimney, and the hand was so big that it took round the child altogether, and thought to take him away. ",14412,14615
172,"I caught hold of the hand above the wrist, and, as I was fastened to the cradle, I did not let go my hold till I cut the hand from the wrist, and there was a howl from the person without. ",14615,14803
173,"I laid the hand in the cradle with the child, and, as I was tired, I fell asleep. ",14803,14885
174,When I awoke I had neither child nor hand. ,14885,14928
175,"I began to howl, and the King heard me, and he cried out that something was wrong with me, and he sent servants to see what was the matter with me, and when the messenger came he saw me covered with blood, and he could not see the child. ",14928,15166
176,"He went to the King, and told him the child was not to be got. ",15166,15229

181,"I went to the King, and took hold of him, and went back again, and began to tear at the door. ",15565,15659
182,"The King followed me, and asked for the key. ",15659,15704

193,The King did not allow me to be tied any more. ,16430,16477
194,"He said there was nothing so much to wonder at as that I cut the hand off, and I tied. ",16477,16564
195,"The child was growing till he was a year old, and he was beginning to walk, and there was no one caring for him more than I was. ",16564,16693

211," ""oh, my heart's love, my shaggy papa, come here till I see you."" ",18047,18113
212,"I was afraid the woman would see me, as she was asking the child where he saw me, and he said I was up in a tree. ",18113,18227
213,"The more the child called me, the more I hid myself. ",18227,18280
214,"The woman took the child home with her, but I knew he would be up early in the morning. ",18280,18368
215,"I went to the parlour window, and the child was within, and he playing. ",18368,18440
216,"When he saw me, he cried out, ""Oh, my heart's love, come here till I see you, shaggy papa."" ",18440,18532
217,"I broke the window, and went in, and he began to kiss me. ",18532,18590
218,"I saw the rod in front of the chimney, and I jumped up at the rod and knocked it down. ",18590,18677
219,"""Oh, my heart's love, no one would give me the pretty rod."" ",18677,18737
220,"I thought he would strike me with the rod, but he did not. ",18737,18796
221,"When I saw the time was short, I raised my paw, and I gave him a scratch below the knee. ",18796,18885
222,"""Oh, you naughty, dirty, shaggy papa! ",18885,18923
223,"You have hurt me so much--I'll give yourself a blow of the rod."" ",18923,18988
224,"He struck me a light blow, and as there was no sin on him, I came back to my own shape again. ",18988,19082
225,"When he saw a man standing before him he gave a cry, and I took him up in my arms. ",19082,19165
226,The servants heard the child. ,19165,19195
227,A maid came in to see what was the matter with him. ,19195,19247
228,"When she saw me she gave a cry out of her, and she said, ""Oh, my soul to God, if the master isn't come to life again."" ",19247,19366
229,"Another came in, and said it was he, really. ",19366,19411
230,"And when the mistress heard of it, she came to see with her own eyes, for she would not believe I was there. ",19411,19520
231,When she saw me she said she'd drown herself. ,19520,19566
232,"And I said to her, ""If you yourself will keep the secret, no living man will ever get the story from me until I lose my head."" ",19566,19693
233,"Many's the man has come asking for the story, and I never let one return; ",19693,19767
234," but now everyone will know it, but she is as much to blame as I. I gave you my head on the spot, and a thousand welcomes, and she cannot say I have been telling anything but the truth. ",19766,19952
235,"""Oh, surely, nor are you now."" ",19952,19983
236,"When I saw I was in a man's shape I said I would take the child back to his father and mother, as I knew the grief they were in after him. ",19983,20122
237,"I got a ship, and took the child with me. ",20122,20164
238,"When I was journeying I came to land on an island, and I saw not a living soul on it, only a court, dark and gloomy. ",20164,20281
239,I went in to see was there anyone in it. ,20281,20322
240,"There was no one but an old hag, tall and frightful, and she asked me, ""What sort of person are you?"" ",20322,20424
241,"I heard someone groaning in another room, and I said I was a doctor, and I asked her what ailed the person who was groaning. ",20424,20549
242,"""Oh,"" said she, ""it is my son, whose hand has been bitten from his wrist by a dog."" ",20549,20633
243,"I knew then it was the boy who was taking the child from me, and I said I would cure him if I got a good reward. ",20633,20746
244,"""I have nothing, but there are eight young lads and three young women, as handsome as anyone laid eyes on, and if you cure him I will give you them."" ",20746,20896
245,"""But tell me in what place his hand was cut from."" ",20896,20947
246,"""Oh, it was out in another country twelve years ago."" ",20947,21001
247,"""Show me the way, that I may see him."" ",21001,21040
248,"She brought me into a room, so that I saw him, and his arm was swelled up to the shoulder. ",21040,21131
249,He asked if I would cure him. ,21131,21161
250,I said I could cure him if he would give me the reward his mother promised. ,21161,21237
251,"""Oh, I will give it, but cure me."" ",21237,21272
252,"""Well, bring them out to me."" ",21272,21302
253,The hag brought them out of the room. ,21302,21340
254,I said I would burn the flesh that was on his arm. ,21340,21391
255,When I looked on him he was howling with pain. ,21391,21438
256,I said that I would not leave him in pain long. ,21438,21486
257,The thief had only one eye in his forehead. ,21486,21530
258,"I took a bar of iron, and put it in the fire till it was red, and I said to the hag, ""He will be howling at first, but will fall asleep presently, and do not wake him until he has slept as much as he wants. ",21530,21737
259,"I will close the door when I am going out."" ",21737,21781
260,"I took the bar with me, and I stood over him, and I turned it across through his eye as far as I could. ",21781,21885
261,"He began to bellow, and tried to catch me, but I was out and away, having closed the door. ",21885,21976
262,"The hag asked me, ""Why is he bellowing?"" ",21976,22017
263,"""Oh, he will be quiet presently, and will sleep for a good while, and I'll come again to have a look at him. ",22017,22126
264,"Bring me out the young men and the young women."" ",22126,22175
265,"I took them with me, and I said to her, ""Tell me where you got them."" ",22175,22245
266,"""Oh, my son brought them with him, and they are the offspring of the one King."" ",22245,22325
267,"I was well satisfied, and I had no liking for delay to get myself free from the hag, and I took them on board the ship, and the child I had myself. ",22325,22473
268,I thought the King might leave me the child I nursed myself. ,22473,22534
269,"But when I came to land, and all those young people with me, the King and Queen were out walking. ",22534,22632
270,"The King was very aged, and the Queen aged likewise. ",22632,22685
271,"When I came to converse with them, and the twelve with me, the King and Queen began to cry. ",22685,22777
272,"I asked, ""Why are you crying?"" ",22777,22808
273,"""Oh, it is for good cause I am crying. ",22808,22847
274,"As many children as these I should have, and now I am withered, grey, at the end of my life, and I have not one at all."" ",22847,22968
275,"""Oh, belike, you will yet have plenty."" ",22968,23008
276,"I told him all I went through, and I gave him the child in his hand, and: ""These are your other children who were stolen from you, whom I am giving to you safe. ",23008,23169
277,"They are gently reared."" ",23169,23194
278,"When the King heard who they were, he smothered them with kisses and drowned them with tears, and dried them with fine cloths, silken, and the hairs of his own head, and so also did their mother, and great was his welcome for me, as it was I who found them all. ",23194,23456
279,"And the King said to me, ""I will give you your own child, as it is you who have earned him best; ",23456,23553
280," but you must come to my court every year, and the child with you, and I will share with you my possessions."" ",23552,23662
281,"""Oh, I have enough of my own, and after my death I will leave it to the child."" ",23662,23742
282,"I spent a time till my visit was over, and I told the King all the troubles I went through, only I said nothing about my wife. ",23742,23869
283,"And now you have the story of the death of Anshgayliacht, the hag's son. ",23869,23942
284,"And Morraha thanked Rough Niall for the story, and he struck the ground with the Sword of Light, and Brown Allree was beside of him and she said to him, ""Sit up, now, riding, and take good heed of yourself,"" and at one leap she cleared the sea and at the next the three miles of hill covered with steel thistles and at the third the three miles of fire, and then he was home and he told the tale of the death of Anshgayliacht to the Slender Red Champion and gave him the Sword of Light, and he was well pleased to get them, and he took the spells of Morraha, and he had his wife and his castle back again, and by-and-by the five children; ",23942,24581
285, but he never put his hand to card-playing with strangers again.,24580,24645
