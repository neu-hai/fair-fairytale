0,HANS had served his master seven years. ,0,40
1,"At the end of the seventh year he said, ""Master, my time is up. ",40,104
2,"I want to go home and see my mother, so give me my wages."" ",104,163
3,"""You have served me truly and faithfully,"" said the master. ",163,223
4,"""As the service is, so must the wages be,"" and he gave him a lump of gold as big as his head. ",223,317
5,"Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket and tied up the lump of gold in it, hoisted it on his shoulder, and set off on his way home. ",317,457
6,"And as he was trudging along, there came in sight a man riding on a spirited horse, and looking very gay and lively. ",457,574
7,"""Oh!"" ",574,580
8,"cried Hans aloud, ""how splendid riding must be! ",580,628
9,"Sitting as much at one's ease as in an arm-chair, stumbling over no stones, saving one's shoes, and getting on one hardly knows how!"" ",628,762
10,"The horseman heard Hans say this, and called out to him, ""Well Hans, what are you doing on foot?"" ",762,860
11,"""I can't help myself,"" said Hans, ""I have this great lump to carry. ",860,928
12,"To be sure, it is gold, but then I can't hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder."" ",928,1026
13,"""I'll tell you what,"" said the horseman, ""we will change. ",1026,1084
14,"I will give you my horse, and you shall give me your lump of gold."" ",1084,1152
15,"""With all my heart,"" said Hans. ",1152,1184
16,"""But I warn you, you will find it heavy."" ",1184,1226
17,And the horseman got down and took the gold. ,1226,1271
18,"Helping Hans up, he gave the reins into his hand. ",1271,1321
19,"""When you want to go fast,"" said he, ""you must click your tongue and cry 'Gee-up!'"" ",1321,1405
20,"And Hans, as he sat upon his horse, was glad at heart, and rode off with merry cheer. ",1405,1491
21,"After a while he thought he should like to go quicker, so he began to click with his tongue and to cry ""Gee-up!"" ",1491,1604
22,"And the horse began to trot, and Hans was thrown before he knew what was going to happen. ",1604,1694
23,There he lay in the ditch by the side of the road. ,1694,1745
24,The horse would have got away but that he was caught by a peasant who was passing that way and driving a cow before him. ,1745,1866
25,"And Hans pulled himself together and got upon his feet, feeling very vexed. ",1866,1942
26,"""Poor work, riding,"" said he. ",1942,1972
27,"""Especially on a jade like this, who starts off and throws you before you know where you are, going near to break your neck. ",1972,2097
28,Never shall I try that game again. ,2097,2132
29,"Now, your cow is something worth having. ",2132,2173
30,"One can jog on comfortably after her and have her milk, butter, and cheese every day, into the bargain. ",2173,2277
31,"What would I not give to have such a cow!"" ",2277,2320
32,"""Well now,"" said the peasant, ""since it will be doing you such a favour, I don't mind exchanging my cow for your horse."" ",2320,2441
33,"Hans agreed most joyfully, and the peasant, swinging himself into the saddle, was soon out of sight. ",2441,2542
34,"And Hans went along driving his cow quietly before him, and thinking all the while of the fine bargain he had made. ",2542,2658
35,"""With only a piece of bread I shall have everything I can possibly want, for I shall always be able to have butter and cheese to it. ",2658,2791
36,If I am thirsty I have nothing to do but to milk my cow. ,2791,2848
37,"What more is there for heart to wish!"" ",2848,2887
38,"And when he came to an inn he made a halt, and in the joy of his heart ate up all the food he had brought with him, dinner and supper and all. ",2887,3030
39,He bought half a glass of beer with his last two farthings. ,3030,3090
40,"Then on he went again driving his cow, until he should come to the village where his mother lived. ",3090,3189
41,"It was now near the middle of the day, and the sun grew hotter and hotter. ",3189,3264
42,Hans found himself on a heath which it would be an hour's journey to cross. ,3264,3340
43,"And he began to feel very hot, and so thirsty that his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth. ",3340,3434
44,"""Never mind,"" said Hans. ",3434,3459
45,"""I can find a remedy. ",3459,3481
46,"I will milk my cow at once."" ",3481,3510
47,"And tying her to a dry tree, and taking off his leather cap to serve for a pail, he began to milk, but not a drop came. ",3510,3630
48,"And as he set to work rather awkwardly, the impatient beast gave him such a kick on the head with his hind foot that he fell to the ground. ",3630,3770
49,For some time could not think where he was. ,3770,3814
50,When luckily there came by a butcher who was wheeling along a young pig in a wheelbarrow. ,3814,3904
51,"""Here's a fine piece of work!"" ",3904,3935
52,"cried he, helping poor Hans on his legs again. ",3935,3982
53,Then Hans related to him all that had happened. ,3982,4030
54,"The butcher handed him his pocket-flask, saying, ""Here, take a drink, and be a man again. ",4030,4120
55,Of course the cow would give no milk. ,4120,4158
56,"She is old and only fit to draw burdens, or to be slaughtered."" ",4158,4222
57,"""Well, to be sure,"" said Hans, scratching his head. ",4222,4274
58,"""Who would have thought it? ",4274,4302
59,of course it is a very handy way of getting meat when a man has a beast of his own to kill. ,4302,4394
60,"For my part I do not care much about cow beef, it is rather tasteless. ",4394,4465
61,"Now, if I had but a young pig, that is much better meat, and then the sausages!"" ",4465,4546
62,"""Look here, Hans,"" said the butcher, ""just for love of you I will exchange, and will give you my pig instead of your cow."" ",4546,4669
63,"""Heaven reward such kindness!"" ",4669,4700
64,cried Hans. ,4700,4712
65,"Handing over the cow, he received in exchange the pig, who was turned out of his wheelbarrow and was to be led by a string. ",4712,4836
66,"So on went Hans, thinking how everything turned out according to his wishes, and how, if trouble overtook him, all was sure to be set right directly. ",4836,4986
67,"After a while he fell in with a peasant, who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. ",4986,5078
68,"They bid each other good-day, and Hans began to tell about his luck, and how he had made so many good exchanges. ",5078,5191
69,And the peasant told how he was taking the goose to a christening feast. ,5191,5264
70,"""Just feel how heavy it is,"" said he, taking it up by the wings. ",5264,5329
71,"""It has been fattening for the last eight weeks. ",5329,5378
72,"When it is roasted, won't the fat run down!"" ",5378,5423
73,"""Yes, indeed,"" said Hans, weighing it in his hand, ""very fine to be sure; ",5423,5497
74," but my pig is not to be despised."" ",5496,5532
75,"Upon which the peasant glanced cautiously on all sides, and shook his head. ",5532,5608
76,"""I am afraid,"" said he, ""that there is something not quite right about your pig. ",5608,5689
77,In the village I have just left one had actually been stolen from the bailiff's yard. ,5689,5775
78,"I fear, I fear you have it in your hand. ",5775,5816
79,"They have sent after the thief, and it would be a bad look-out for you if it was found upon you. ",5816,5913
80,"The least that could happen would be to be thrown into a dark hole."" ",5913,5982
81,Poor Hans grew pale with fright. ,5982,6015
82,"""For heaven's sake,"" said he, ""help me out of this scrape, I am a stranger in these parts. ",6015,6106
83,"Take my pig and give me your goose."" ",6106,6143
84,"""It will be running some risk,"" answered the man, ""but I will do it sooner than that you should come to grief."" ",6143,6255
85,"And so, taking the cord in his hand, he drove the pig quickly along a by-path. ",6255,6334
86,Lucky Hans went on his way home with the goose under his arm. ,6334,6396
87,"""The more I think of it,"" said he to himself, ""the better the bargain seems. ",6396,6473
88,"First I get the roast goose, then the fat, that will last a whole year for bread and dripping. ",6473,6568
89,Lastly the beautiful white feathers which I can stuff my pillow with. ,6568,6638
90,"How comfortably I shall sleep upon it, and how pleased my mother will be!"" ",6638,6713
91,"And when he reached the last village, he saw a knife-grinder with his barrow. ",6713,6791
92,"His wheel went whirring round, and he sang, ""My scissors I grind, and my wheel I turn. ",6791,6878
93,"And all good fellows my trade should learn, For all that I meet with just serves my turn."" ",6878,6969
94,And Hans stood and looked at him. ,6969,7003
95,"At last he spoke to him and said, ""You seem very well off, and merry with your grinding."" ",7003,7093
96,"""Yes,"" answered the knife-grinder, ""my handiwork pays very well. ",7093,7158
97,"I call a man a good grinder who, every time he puts his hand in his pocket finds money there. ",7158,7252
98,"But where did you buy that fine goose?"" ",7252,7292
99,"""I did not buy it, but I exchanged it for my pig,"" said Hans. ",7292,7354
100,"""And the pig?"" ",7354,7369
101,"""That I exchanged for a cow."" ",7369,7399
102,"""And the cow?"" ",7399,7414
103,"""That I exchanged for a horse."" ",7414,7446
104,"""And the horse?"" ",7446,7463
105,"""I gave for the horse a lump of gold as big as my head."" ",7463,7520
106,"""And the gold?"" ",7520,7536
107,"""Oh, that was my wage for seven years' service."" ",7536,7585
108,"""You seem to have fended for yourself very well,"" said the knife-grinder. ",7585,7659
109,"""Now, if you could but manage to have money in your pocket every time you put your hand in, your fortune is made."" ",7659,7774
110,"""How shall I manage that?"" ",7774,7801
111,said Hans. ,1173,1184
112,"""You must be a knife-grinder like me,"" said the man. ",7812,7865
113,"""All you want is a grindstone, the rest comes of itself: I have one here. ",7865,7939
114,"To be sure it is a little damaged, but I don't mind letting you have it in exchange for your goose. ",7939,8039
115,"What say you?"" ",8039,8054
116,"""How can you ask?"" ",8054,8073
117,answered Hans. ,8073,8088
118,"""I shall be the luckiest fellow in the world. ",8088,8134
119,"For if I find money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, there is nothing more left to want."" ",8134,8228
120,And so he handed over the goose to the pedlar and received the grindstone in exchange. ,8228,8315
121,"""Now,"" said the knife-grinder, taking up a heavy common stone that lay near him, ""here is another proper sort of stone that will stand a good deal of wear and that you can hammer out your old nails upon. ",8315,8519
122,"Take it with you, and carry it carefully."" ",8519,8562
123,Hans lifted up the stone and carried it off with a contented mind. ,8562,8629
124,"""I must have been born under a lucky star!"" ",8629,8673
125,"cried he, while his eyes sparkled for joy. ",8673,8716
126,"""I have only to wish for a thing and it is mine."" ",8716,8766
127,"After a while he began to feel rather tired, as indeed he had been on his legs since daybreak. ",8766,8861
128,He also began to feel rather hungry. ,8861,8898
129,"In the fulness of his joy at getting the cow, he had eaten up all he had. ",8898,8972
130,"At last he could scarcely go on at all, and had to make a halt every moment. ",8972,9049
131,The stones weighed him down most unmercifully. ,9049,9096
132,He could not help wishing that he did not feel obliged to drag them along. ,9096,9171
133,And on he went at a snail's pace until he came to a well. ,9171,9229
134,Then he thought he would rest and take a drink of the fresh water. ,9229,9296
135,And he placed the stones carefully by his side at the edge of the well. ,9296,9368
136,"Then he sat down, and as he stooped to drink, he happened to give the stones a little push. ",9368,9460
137,They both fell into the water with a splash. ,9460,9505
138,"And then Hans, having watched them disappear, jumped for joy, and thanked his stars that he had been so lucky as to get rid of the stones that had weighed upon him so long without any effort of his own. ",9505,9708
139,"""I really think,"" cried he, ""I am the luckiest man under the sun."" ",9708,9775
140,"So on he went, void of care, until he reached his mother's house.",9775,9841
