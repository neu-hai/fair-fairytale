0,There was once an old widow woman. ,0,35
1,"Who lived in a little cottage with her only daughter, who was such a bonnie lassie that everyone liked to look at her. ",35,154
2,One day the old woman took a notion into her head to bake a girdleful of cakes. ,154,234
3,"So she took down her bakeboard, and went to the chest and fetched a basinful of meal. ",234,320
4,"When she went to seek a jug of water to mix the meal with, she found that there was none in the house. ",320,423
5,"So she called to her daughter, who was in the garden. ",423,477
6,"When the girl came she held out the empty jug to her, saying, ""Run, like a good lassie, to the Well of the World's End and bring me a jug of water. ",477,625
7,"I have long found that water from the Well of the World's End makes the best cakes."" ",625,710
8,So the girl took the jug and set out on her errand. ,710,762
9,"Now, as its name shows, it is a long road to that well, and many a weary mile had the poor maid to go before she reached it. ",762,887
10,But she arrived there at last. ,887,918
11,It was her disappointment to find it dry. ,918,960
12,She was so tired and so vexed that she sat down beside it and began to cry. ,960,1036
13,"She did not know where to get any more water, and she felt that she could not go back to her mother with an empty jug. ",1036,1155
14,"While she was crying, a nice yellow Paddock, with very bright eyes, came jump-jump-jumping over the stones of the well. ",1155,1275
15,"It squatted down at her feet, looking up into her face. ",1275,1331
16,"""And why are you greeting, my bonnie maid?"" ",1331,1375
17,he asked. ,1375,1385
18,"""Is there anything that I can do to help you?"" ",1385,1432
19,"""I am greeting because the well is empty,"" she answered, ""and I cannot get any water to carry home to my mother."" ",1432,1546
20,"""Listen,"" said the Paddock softly. ",1546,1581
21,"""I can get you water in plenty, if you will promise to be my wife."" ",1581,1649
22,"Now the lassie had but one thought in her head, and that was to get the water for her mother's oat-cakes. ",1649,1755
23,"She never for a moment thought that the Paddock was in earnest, so she promised gladly enough to be his wife, if he would get her a jug of water. ",1755,1901
24,No sooner had the words passed her lips than the beastie jumped down the mouth of the well. ,1901,1993
25,In another moment it was full to the brim with water. ,1993,2047
26,"The lassie filled her jug and carried it home, without troubling any more about the matter. ",2047,2139
27,"But late that night, just as her mother and she were going to bed, something came with a faint ""thud, thud,"" against the cottage door. ",2139,2274
28,"Then they heard a tiny little voice singing: ""Oh, open the door, my hinnie, my heart, Oh, open the door, my own true love; ",2274,2397
29," Remember the promise that you and I made Down in the meadow, where we two met."" ",2396,2477
30,"""Hush,"" said the old woman, raising her head. ",2477,2523
31,"""What noise is that at the door?"" ",2523,2557
32,"""Oh,"" said her daughter, who was feeling rather frightened, ""it's only a yellow Paddock."" ",2557,2647
33,"""Poor bit beastie,"" said the kind-hearted old mother. ",2647,2701
34,"""Open the door and let him in. ",2701,2732
35,"It's cold work sitting on the doorstep."" ",2732,2773
36,"So the lassie, very unwillingly opened the door, and the Paddock came jump-jump-jumping across the kitchen, and sat down at the fireside. ",2773,2911
37,"And while he sat there he began to sing this song: ""Oh, give me my supper, my hinnie, my heart, Oh, give me my supper, my own true love; ",2911,3048
38," Remember the promise that you and I made Down in the meadow, where we two met."" ",2396,2477
39,"""Give the poor beast his supper,"" said the old woman. ",3128,3182
40,"""He's an uncommon Paddock that can sing like that."" ",3182,3234
41,"""Tut,"" replied her daughter crossly, for she was growing more and more frightened as she saw the creature's bright black eyes fixed on her face. ",3234,3379
42,"""I'm not going to be so silly as to feed a wet, sticky Paddock."" ",3379,3444
43,"""Don't be ill-natured and cruel,"" said her mother. ",3444,3495
44,"""Who knows how far the little beastie has travelled? ",3495,3548
45,"And I warrant that it would like a saucerful of milk."" ",3548,3603
46,"Now, the lassie could have told her that the Paddock had travelled from the Well o' the World's End. ",3603,3704
47,"But she held her tongue, and went to the milk-house, and brought back a saucerful of milk, which she set down before the strange little visitor. ",3704,3849
48,"""Now chop off my head, my hinnie, my heart, Now chop off my head, my own true love, Remember the promise that you and I made Down in the meadow, where we two met."" ",3849,4013
49,"""Pay no heed, the creature's daft,"" exclaimed the old woman, running forward to stop her daughter, who was raising the axe to chop off the Paddock's head. ",4013,4168
50,But she was too late. ,4168,4190
51,"Down came the axe, off went the head. ",4190,4228
52,"Lo, and behold! ",4228,4244
53,"on the spot where the little creature had sat, stood the most handsome young Prince that had ever been seen. ",4244,4353
54,"He wore such a noble air, and was so richly dressed, that the astonished girl and her mother would have fallen on their knees before him had he not prevented them by a movement of his hand. ",4353,4543
55,"""It is I that should kneel to you, Sweetheart,"" he said, turning to the blushing girl. ",4543,4630
56,"""For you have delivered me from a fearful spell, which was cast over me in my infancy by a wicked Fairy, who at the same time slew my father. ",4630,4772
57,"For long years I have lived in that well, the Well of the World's End, waiting for a maiden to appear, who should take pity on me, even in my loathsome disguise. ",4772,4934
58,"She who would promise to be my wife, and who would also have the kindness to let me into her house, and the courage, at my bidding, to cut off my head."" ",4934,5087
59,"""Now I can return and claim my father's Kingdom, and you, most gracious maiden, will go with me, and be my bride, for you well deserve the honour."" ",5087,5235
60,And this was how the girl who went to fetch water from the Well of the World's End became a Princess.,5235,5337
