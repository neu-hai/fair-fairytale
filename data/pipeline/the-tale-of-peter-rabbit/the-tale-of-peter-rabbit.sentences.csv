0,"ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were-- Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. ",0,111
1,"They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree. ",111,200
2,"""NOW, my dears,"" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, ""you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; ",200,373
3, he was put in a pie by Mrs. ,372,401
4,"McGregor."" ",401,412
5,"""NOW run along, and don't get into mischief. ",412,457

8,She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns. ,543,599
9,"FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries; ",599,703
10," BUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden and squeezed under the gate! ",702,808
11,FIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; ,808,858
12, and then he ate some radishes; ,857,889
13," AND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley. ",888,954
14,"BUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor! ",954,1031
15,"MR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, ""Stop thief!"" ",1031,1183
16,PETER was most dreadfully frightened; ,1183,1221
17," he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate. ",1220,1299
18,"He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. ",1299,1385
19,"AFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. ",1385,1597
20,"It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new. ",1597,1649
21,"PETER gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; ",1649,1701
22," but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself. ",1700,1828
23,"MR. McGREGOR came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; ",1828,1911
24," but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him. ",1910,1979
25,"AND rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can. ",1979,2032
26,"It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it. ",2032,2120
27,"MR. McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. ",2120,2230
28,"He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each. ",2230,2288
29,"Presently Peter sneezed--""Kertyschoo!"" ",2288,2327
30,"Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, AND tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. ",2327,2456
31,"The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. ",2456,2540
32,He went back to his work. ,2540,2566
33,PETER sat down to rest; ,2566,2590
34," he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. ",2589,2685
35,Also he was very damp with sitting in that can. ,2685,2733
36,"After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all around. ",2733,2835
37,HE found a door in a wall; ,2835,2862
38," but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath. ",2861,2950
39,"An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. ",2950,3062
40,"Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. ",3062,3168
41,She only shook her head at him. ,3168,3200
42,Peter began to cry. ,3200,3220
43,"THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. ",3220,3315
44,"Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. ",3315,3386
45,A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; ,3386,3429
46," she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. ",3428,3522
47,Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; ,3522,3580
48," he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. ",3579,3644
49,"HE went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. ",3644,3783
50,Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. ,3783,3822
51,"But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. ",3822,3920
52,The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. ,3920,3975
53,"His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate! ",3975,4039
54,"PETER got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes. ",4039,4188
55,"Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. ",4188,4260
56,"He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden. ",4260,4345
57,MR. McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds. ,4345,4443
58,PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree. ,4443,4530
59,"He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. ",4530,4643
60,His mother was busy cooking; ,4643,4672
61, she wondered what he had done with his clothes. ,4671,4720
62,It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight! ,4720,4806
63,I AM sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. ,4806,4873
64,"His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; ",4873,4928
65, and she gave a dose of it to Peter! ,4927,4964
66,"""One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time."" ",4964,5010
