0,"There were once upon a time five-and twenty tin-soldiers-all brothers, as they were made out of the same old tin spoon. ",0,120
1,"Their uniform was red and blue, and they shouldered their guns and looked straight in front of them. ",120,221
2,"The first words that they heard in this world, when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off, were: 'Hurrah, tin-soldiers!' ",221,355
3,"This was exclaimed by a little boy, clapping his hands; ",355,411
4," they had been given to him because it was his birthday, and now he began setting them out on the table. ",410,515
5,"Each soldier was exactly like the other in shape, except just one, who had been made last when the tin had run short; ",515,633
6," but there he stood as firmly on his one leg as the others did on two, and he is the one that became famous. ",632,741
7,"There were many other playthings on the table on which they were being set out, but the nicest of all was a pretty little castle made of cardboard, with windows through which you could see into the rooms. ",741,946
8,In front of the castle stood some little trees surrounding a tiny mirror which looked like a lake. ,946,1045
9,Wax swans were floating about and reflecting themselves in it. ,1045,1108
10,That was all very pretty; ,1108,1134
11," but the most beautiful thing was a little lady, who stood in the open doorway. ",1133,1213
12,"She was cut out of paper, but she had on a dress of the finest muslin, with a scarf of narrow blue ribbon round her shoulders, fastened in the middle with a glittering rose made of gold paper, which was as large as her head. ",1213,1438
13,"The little lady was stretching out both her arms, for she was a Dancer, and was lifting up one leg so high in the air that the Tin-soldier couldn't find it anywhere, and thought that she, too, had only one leg. ",1438,1649
14,'That's the wife for me!' ,1649,1675
15,he thought; ,1675,1687
16," 'but she is so grand, and lives in a castle, whilst I have only a box with four-and-twenty others. ",1686,1786
17,This is no place for her! ,1786,1812
18,But I must make her acquaintance.' ,1812,1847
19,Then he stretched himself out behind a snuff-box that lay on the table; ,1847,1919
20," from thence he could watch the dainty little lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance. ",1918,2032
21,"When the night came all the other tin-soldiers went into their box, and the people of the house went to bed. ",2032,2141
22,"Then the toys began to play at visiting, dancing, and fighting. ",2141,2205
23,"The tin-soldiers rattled in their box, for they wanted to be out too, but they could not raise the lid. ",2205,2309
24,"The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the slate-pencil ran about the slate; ",2309,2389
25," there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk to them, in poetry too! ",2388,2478
26,The only two who did not stir from their places were the Tin-soldier and the little Dancer. ,2478,2570
27,"She remained on tip-toe, with both arms outstretched; ",2570,2624
28," he stood steadfastly on his one leg, never moving his eyes from her face. ",2623,2698
29,"The clock struck twelve, and crack! ",2698,2734
30,off flew the lid of the snuff-box; ,2734,2769
31," but there was no snuff inside, only a little black imp-that was the beauty of it. ",2768,2851
32,"'Hullo, Tin-soldier!' ",2851,2873
33,said the imp. ,2873,2887
34,'Don't look at things that aren't intended for the likes of you!' ,2887,2953
35,"But the Tin-soldier took no notice, and seemed not to hear. ",2953,3013
36,"'Very well, wait till to-morrow!' ",3013,3047
37,said the imp. ,2873,2887
38,"When it was morning, and the children had got up, the Tin-soldier was put in the window; ",3061,3150
39," and whether it was the wind or the little black imp, I don't know, but all at once the window flew open and out fell the little Tin-soldier, head over heels, from the third-storey window! ",3149,3338
40,"That was a terrible fall, I can tell you! ",3338,3380
41,"He landed on his head with his leg in the air, his gun being wedged between two paving-stones. ",3380,3475
42,"The nursery-maid and the little boy came down at once to look for him, but, though they were so near him that they almost trod on him, they did not notice him. ",3475,3635
43,If the Tin-soldier had only called out 'Here I am!' ,3635,3687
44,they must have found him; ,3687,3713
45," but he did not think it fitting for him to cry out, because he had on his uniform. ",3712,3796
46,Soon it began to drizzle; ,3796,3822
47," then the drops came faster, and there was a regular down-pour. ",3821,3885
48,"When it was over, two little street boys came along. ",3885,3938
49,'Just look!' ,3938,3951
50,cried one. ,3951,3962
51,'Here is a Tin-soldier! ,3962,3986
52,He shall sail up and down in a boat!' ,3986,4024
53,"So they made a little boat out of newspaper, put the Tin-soldier in it, and made him sail up and down the gutter; ",4024,4138
54," both the boys ran along beside him, clapping their hands. ",4137,4196
55,"What great waves there were in the gutter, and what a swift current! ",4196,4265
56,"The paper-boat tossed up and down, and in the middle of the stream it went so quick that the Tin-soldier trembled; ",4265,4380
57," but he remained steadfast, showed no emotion, looked straight in front of him, shouldering his gun. ",4379,4480
58,All at once the boat passed under a long tunnel that was as dark as his box had been. ,4480,4566
59,'Where can I be coming now?' ,4566,4595
60,he wondered. ,4595,4608
61,"'Oh, dear! ",4608,4619
62,This is the black imp's fault! ,4619,4650
63,"Ah, if only the little lady were sitting beside me in the boat, it might be twice as dark for all I should care!' ",4650,4764
64,Suddenly there came along a great water-rat that lived in the tunnel. ,4764,4834
65,'Have you a passport?' ,4834,4857
66,asked the rat. ,4857,4872
67,'Out with your passport!' ,4872,4898
68,"But the Tin-soldier was silent, and grasped his gun more firmly. ",4898,4963
69,"The boat sped on, and the rat behind it. ",4963,5004
70,Ugh! ,5004,5009
71,"how he showed his teeth, as he cried to the chips of wood and straw: 'Hold him, hold him! ",5009,5099
72,he has not paid the toll! ,5099,5125
73,He has not shown his passport!' ,5125,5157
74,But the current became swifter and stronger. ,5157,5202
75,The Tin-soldier could already see daylight where the tunnel ended; ,5202,5269
76, but in his ears there sounded a roaring enough to frighten any brave man. ,5268,5343
77,Only think! ,5343,5355
78,at the end of the tunnel the gutter discharged itself into a great canal; ,5355,5429
79, that would be just as dangerous for him as it would be for us to go down a waterfall. ,5428,5515
80,Now he was so near to it that he could not hold on any longer. ,5515,5578
81,"On went the boat, the poor Tin-soldier keeping himself as stiff as he could: no one should say of him afterwards that he had flinched. ",5578,5713
82,"The boat whirled three, four times round, and became filled to the brim with water: it began to sink! ",5713,5815
83,"The Tin-soldier was standing up to his neck in water, and deeper and deeper sank the boat, and softer and softer grew the paper; ",5815,5944
84, now the water was over his head. ,5943,5977
85,"He was thinking of the pretty little Dancer, whose face he should never see again, and there sounded in his ears, over and over again: 'Forward, forward, soldier bold! ",5977,6145
86,"Death's before thee, grim and cold!' ",6145,6182
87,"The paper came in two, and the soldier fell-but at that moment he was swallowed by a great fish. ",6182,6279
88,Oh! ,6279,6283
89,"how dark it was inside, even darker than in the tunnel, and it was really very close quarters! ",6283,6378
90,"But there the steadfast little Tin-soldier lay full length, shouldering his gun. ",6378,6459
91,"Up and down swam the fish, then he made the most dreadful contortions, and became suddenly quite still. ",6459,6563
92,Then it was as if a flash of lightning had passed through him; ,6563,6626
93," the daylight streamed in, and a voice exclaimed, 'Why, here is the little Tin-soldier!' ",6625,6714
94,"The fish had been caught, taken to market, sold, and brought into the kitchen, where the cook had cut it open with a great knife. ",6714,6844
95,"She took up the soldier between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room, where everyone wanted to see the hero who had been found inside a fish; ",6844,7001
96, but the Tin-soldier was not at all proud. ,7000,7043
97,"They put him on the table, and-no, but what strange things do happen in this world!-the Tin-soldier was in the same room in which he had been before! ",7043,7193
98,"He saw the same children, and the same toys on the table; ",7193,7251
99, and there was the same grand castle with the pretty little Dancer. ,7250,7318
100,She was still standing on one leg with the other high in the air; ,7318,7384
101, she too was steadfast. ,7383,7407
102,"That touched the Tin-soldier, he was nearly going to shed tin-tears; ",7407,7476
103, but that would not have been fitting for a soldier. ,7475,7528
104,"He looked at her, but she said nothing. ",7528,7568
105,"All at once one of the little boys took up the Tin-soldier, and threw him into the stove, giving no reasons; ",7568,7677
106, but doubtless the little black imp in the snuff-box was at the bottom of this too. ,7676,7760
107,"There the Tin-soldier lay, and felt a heat that was truly terrible; ",7760,7828
108," but whether he was suffering from actual fire, or from the ardour of his passion, he did not know. ",7827,7927
109,All his colour had disappeared; ,7927,7959
110," whether this had happened on his travels or whether it was the result of trouble, who can say? ",7958,8054
111,"He looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt that he was melting; ",8054,8136
112," but he remained steadfast, with his gun at his shoulder. ",8135,8193
113,"Suddenly a door opened, the draught caught up the little Dancer, and off she flew like a sylph to the Tin-soldier in the stove, burst into flames-and that was the end of her! ",8193,8368
114,"Then the Tin-soldier melted down into a little lump, and when next morning the maid was taking out the ashes, she found him in the shape of a heart. ",8368,8517
115,"There was nothing left of the little Dancer but her gilt rose, burnt as black as a cinder.",8517,8608
