0,"A whipping top and a little ball lay together in a box, among other toys, and the top said to the ball, ""Shall we be married, as we live in the same box?"" ",0,155
1,"But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply. ",155,300
2,"The next day came the little boy to whom the playthings belonged, and he painted the top red and yellow, and drove a brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was spinning round it looked splendid. ",300,513
3,"""Look at me,"" said the top to the ball. ",513,553
4,"""What do you say now? ",553,575
5,Shall we be engaged to each other? ,575,610
6,We should suit so well; ,610,634
7," you spring, and I dance. ",633,659
8,"No one could be happier than we should be."" ",659,703
9,"""Indeed! ",703,712
10,do you think so? ,712,729
11,"Perhaps you do not know that my father and mother were morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork in my body."" ",729,846
12,"""Yes; ",846,852
13," but I am made of mahogany,"" said the top. ",851,894
14,"""The major himself turned me. ",894,924
15,"He has a turning lathe of his own, and it is a great amusement to him."" ",924,996
16,Next day the ball was taken out by the boy. ,996,1040
17,"The top saw it flying high in the air, like a bird, till it would go quite out of sight. ",1040,1129
18,"Each time it came back, as it touched the earth, it gave a higher leap than before, either because it longed to fly upwards, or from having a Spanish cork in its body. ",1129,1297
19,"But the ninth time it rose in the air, it remained away, and did not return. ",1297,1374
20,"The boy searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could not be found; ",1374,1462
21, it was gone. ,1461,1475
22,"""I know very well where she is,"" sighed the top; ",1475,1524
23," ""she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."" ",1523,1585
24,"The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball. ",1585,1652
25,"His love increased the more, just because he could not get her; ",1652,1716
26," and that she should have been won by another, was the worst of all. ",1715,1784
27,"The top still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think of the ball; ",1784,1863
28," and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed to his fancy. ",1862,1939
29,"Thus several years passed by, and his love became quite old. ",1939,2000
30,"The top, also, was no longer young; ",2000,2036
31, but there came a day when he looked handsomer than ever; ,2035,2093
32, for he was gilded all over. ,2092,2121
33,"He was now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was something worth looking at; ",2121,2238
34," but one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone. ",2237,2299
35,"They searched everywhere, even in the cellar, but he was nowhere to be found. ",2299,2377
36,Where could he be? ,2377,2396
37,"He had jumped into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were lying: cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from the gutter under the roof. ",2396,2562
38,"""Now I am in a nice place,"" said he; ",2562,2599
39," ""my gilding will soon be washed off here. ",2598,2641
40,"Oh dear, what a set of rabble I have got amongst!"" ",2641,2692
41,"And then he glanced at a curious round thing like an old apple, which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk. ",2692,2803
42,"It was, however, not an apple, but an old ball, which had lain for years in the gutter, and was soaked through with water. ",2803,2926
43,"""Thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom I can talk,"" said the ball, examining the gilded top. ",2926,3039
44,"""I am made of morocco,"" she said. ",3039,3073
45,"""I was sewn together by a young lady, and I have a Spanish cork in my body; ",3073,3149
46," but no one would think it, to look at me now. ",3148,3195
47,I was once engaged to a swallow; ,3195,3228
48," but I fell in here from the gutter under the roof, and I have lain here more than five years, and have been thoroughly drenched. ",3227,3357
49,"Believe me, it is a long time for a young maiden."" ",3357,3408
50,"The top said nothing, but he thought of his old love; ",3408,3462
51," and the more she said, the more clear it became to him that this was the same ball. ",3461,3546
52,The servant then came to clean out the dust-bin. ,3546,3595
53,"""Ah,"" she exclaimed, ""here is a gilt top."" ",3595,3638
54,"So the top was brought again to notice and honor, but nothing more was heard of the little ball. ",3638,3735
55,He spoke not a word about his old love; ,3735,3775
56, for that soon died away. ,3774,3800
57,"When the beloved object has lain for five years in a gutter, and has been drenched through, no one cares to know her again on meeting her in a dust-bin.",3800,3953
