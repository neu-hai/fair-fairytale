0,"At the time when the Tang dynasty reigned over the Middle Kingdom, there were master swordsmen of various kinds. ",0,113
1,Those who came first were the saints of the sword. ,113,164
2,"They were able to take different shapes at will, and their swords were like strokes of lightning. ",164,262
3,Before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen. ,262,343
4,"Yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind, and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world. ",343,451
5,The second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes. ,451,510
6,"It was their custom to slay the unjust, and to come to the aid of the oppressed. ",510,591
7,They wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt. ,591,672
8,By magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water. ,672,742
9,"They could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls, and they came and went and left no trace. ",742,838
10,The swordsmen of the lowest sort were the mere bought slayers. ,838,901
11,They hired themselves out to those who wished to do away with their enemies. ,901,978
12,And death was an everyday matter to them. ,978,1020
13,Old Dragonbeard must have been a master swordsman standing midway between those of the first and of the second order. ,1020,1138
14,"Molo, however, of whom this story tells, was a sword hero. ",1138,1197
15,"At that time there lived a young man named Tsui, whose father was a high official and the friend of the prince. ",1197,1309
16,"And the father once sent his son to visit his princely friend, who was ill. ",1309,1385
17,"The son was young, handsome and gifted. ",1385,1425
18,He went to carry out his father's instructions. ,1425,1473
19,"When he entered the prince's palace, there stood three beautiful slave girls, who piled rosy peaches into a golden bowl, poured sugar over them and presented them to him. ",1473,1644
20,"After he had eaten he took his leave, and his princely host ordered one of the slave girls, Rose-Red by name, to escort him to the gate. ",1644,1781
21,As they went along the young man kept looking back at her. ,1781,1840
22,And she smiled at him and made signs with her fingers. ,1840,1895
23,"First she would stretch out three fingers, then she would turn her hand around three times, and finally she would point to a little mirror which she wore on her breast. ",1895,2064
24,"When they parted she whispered to him: ""Do not forget me!"" ",2064,2123
25,When the young man reached home his thoughts were all in confusion. ,2123,2191
26,And he sat down absent-mindedly like a wooden rooster. ,2191,2246
27,"Now it happened that he had an old servant named Molo, who was an extraordinary being. ",2246,2333
28,"""What is the trouble, master,"" said he. ",2333,2373
29,"""Why are you so sad? ",2373,2394
30,"Do you not want to tell your old slave about it?"" ",2394,2444
31,"So the boy told him what had occurred, and also mentioned the signs the girl had made to him in secret. ",2444,2548
32,"Said Molo: ""When she stretched out three fingers, it meant that she is quartered in the third court of the palace. ",2548,2663
33,"When she turned round her hand three times, it meant the sum of three times five fingers, which is fifteen. ",2663,2771
34,"When she pointed at the little mirror, she meant to say that on the fifteenth, when the moon is round as a mirror, at midnight, you are to go for her."" ",2771,2923
35,"Then the young man was roused from his confused thoughts, and was so happy he could hardly control himself. ",2923,3031
36,"But soon he grew sad again and said: ""The prince's palace is shut off as though by an ocean. ",3031,3124
37,"How would it be possible to win into it?"" ",3124,3166
38,"""Nothing easier,"" said Molo. ",3166,3195
39,"""On the fifteenth we will take two pieces of dark silk and wrap ourselves up in them, and thus I will carry you there. ",3195,3314
40,"Yet there is a wild dog on guard at the slave girl's court, who is strong as a tiger and watchful as a god. ",3314,3422
41,"No one can pass by him, so he must be killed."" ",3422,3469
42,"When the appointed day had come, the servant said: ""There is no one else in the world who can kill this dog but myself!"" ",3469,3590
43,"Full of joy the youth gave him meat and wine, and the old man took a chain-hammer and disappeared with it. ",3590,3697
44,"And after no more time had elapsed than it takes to eat a meal he was back again and said: ""The dog is dead, and there is nothing further to hinder us!"" ",3697,3850
45,"At midnight they wrapped themselves in dark silk, and the old man carried the youth over the tenfold walls which surrounded the palace. ",3850,3986
46,They reached the third gateway and the gate stood ajar. ,3986,4042
47,"Then they saw the glow of a little lamp, and heard Rose-Red sigh deeply. ",4042,4115
48,The entire court was silent and deserted. ,4115,4157
49,The youth raised the curtain and stepped into the room. ,4157,4213
50,"Long and searchingly Rose-Red looked at him, then seized his hand. ",4213,4280
51,"""I knew that you were intelligent, and would understand my sign language. ",4280,4354
52,"But what magic power have you at your disposal, that you were able to get here?"" ",4354,4435
53,The youth told her in detail how Molo had helped him. ,4435,4489
54,"""And where is Molo?"" ",4489,4510
55,she asked. ,4510,4521
56,"""Outside, before the curtain,"" was his answer. ",4521,4568
57,"Then she called him in and gave him wine to drink from a jade goblet and said: ""I am of good family and have come here from far away. ",4568,4702
58,Force alone has made me a slave in this palace. ,4702,4750
59,I long to leave it. ,4750,4770
60,"For though I have jasper chop-sticks with which to eat, and drink my wine from golden flagons, though silk and satin rustle around me and jewels of every kind are at my disposal, all these are but so many chains and fetters to hold me here. ",4770,5011
61,"Dear Molo, you are endowed with magic powers. ",5011,5057
62,I beg you to save me in my distress! ,5057,5094
63,"If you do, I will be glad to serve your master as a slave, and will never forget the favor you do me."" ",5094,5197
64,The youth looked at Molo. ,5197,5223
65,Molo was quite willing. ,5223,5247
66,First he asked permission to carry away Rose-Red's gear and jewels in sacks and bags. ,5247,5333
67,Three times he went away and returned until he had finished. ,5333,5394
68,"Then he took his master and Rose-Red upon his back, and flew away with them over the steep walls. ",5394,5492
69,None of the watchmen of the prince's palace noticed anything out of the way. ,5492,5569
70,At home the youth hid Rose-Red in a distant room. ,5569,5619
71,"When the prince discovered that one of his slave-girls was missing, and that one of his wild dogs had been killed, he said: ""That must have been some powerful sword hero!"" ",5619,5791
72,"And he gave strict orders that the matter should not be mentioned, and that investigations should be made in secret. ",5791,5908
73,"Two years passed, and the youth no longer thought of any danger. ",5908,5973
74,"Hence, when the flowers began to bloom in the spring, Rose-Red went driving in a small wagon outside the city, near the river. ",5973,6100
75,"And there one of the prince's servants saw her, and informed his master. ",6100,6173
76,"The latter sent for the youth, who, since he could not conceal the matter, told him the whole story exactly as it had happened. ",6173,6301
77,"Said the prince: ""The whole blame rests on Rose-Red. ",6301,6354
78,I do not reproach you. ,6354,6377
79,Yet since she is now your wife I will let the whole matter rest. ,6377,6442
80,"But Molo will have to suffer for it!"" ",6442,6480
81,"So he ordered a hundred armored soldiers, with bows and swords, to surround the house of the youth, and under all circumstances to take Molo captive. ",6480,6630
82,But Molo drew his dagger and flew up the high wall. ,6630,6682
83,Thence he looked about him like a hawk. ,6682,6722
84,"The arrows flew as thick as rain, but not one hit him. ",6722,6777
85,"And in a moment he had disappeared, no one knew where. ",6777,6832
86,"Yet ten years later one of his former master's servants ran across him in the South, where he was selling medicine. ",6832,6948
87,And he looked exactly as he had looked ten years before.,6948,7005
