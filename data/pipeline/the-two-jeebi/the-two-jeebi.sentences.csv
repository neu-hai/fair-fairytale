0,"There lived a hunter in the North, who had a wife and one child. ",0,65
1,"His lodge stood far off in the forest, several days' journey from any other. ",65,142
2,"He spent his days in hunting, and his evenings in relating to his wife the incidents that had befallen him. ",142,250
3,"As game was very abundant, he found no difficulty in killing as much as they wanted. ",250,335
4,"Just in all his acts, he lived a peaceful and happy life. ",335,393
5,"One evening during the winter season, it chanced that he remained out longer than usual, and his wife began to fear that some accident had befallen him. ",393,546
6,It was already dark. ,546,567
7,"She listened attentively, and at last heard the sound of approaching footsteps. ",567,647
8,"Not doubting that it was her husband, she went to the door and beheld two strange females. ",647,738
9,"She bade them enter, and invited them to remain. ",738,787
10,She observed that they were total strangers in the country. ,787,847
11,"There was something so peculiar in their looks, air and manner, that she was disturbed by their presence. ",847,953
12,They would not come near to the fire. ,953,991
13,"They sat in a remote part of the lodge, shy and taciturn, and drew their garments about them in such a manner as nearly to hide their faces. ",991,1132
14,"So far as she could judge, they were pale, hollow-eyed, and long-visaged, very thin and emaciated. ",1132,1231
15,"There was but little light in the lodge, as the fire was low, and its fitful flashes, by disclosing their white faces and then dropping them in sudden darkness, served rather to increase than to dispel her fears. ",1231,1444
16,"""Merciful Spirit!"" ",1444,1463
17,cried a voice from the opposite part of the lodge; ,1463,1514
18," ""there are two corpses clothed with garments!"" ",1513,1561
19,"The hunter's wife turned around, but seeing nobody save her little child, staring across from under his blanket, she said to herself, ""The boy can not speak; ",1561,1719
20," the sounds were but the gusts of wind."" ",1718,1759
21,"She trembled, and was ready to sink to the earth. ",1759,1809
22,"Her husband at this moment entered, and in some measure relieved her alarm. ",1809,1885
23,He threw down the carcass of a large fat deer. ,1885,1932
24,"""Behold what a fine and fat animal!"" ",1932,1969
25,cried the mysterious females; ,1969,1999
26," and they immediately ran and pulled off pieces of the whitest fat, which they greedily devoured. ",1998,2096
27,"The hunter and his wife looked on with astonishment, but remained silent. ",2096,2170
28,They supposed that their guests might have been stricken with famine. ,2170,2240
29,"The next day, however, the same unusual conduct was repeated. ",2240,2302
30,The strange females again tore off the fat and devoured it with eagerness. ,2302,2377
31,"The third day, the hunter thought that he would anticipate their wants by tying up a share of the hunt, and placing it apart for their express use. ",2377,2525
32,"They accepted it, but still appeared dissatisfied, and went to the wife's portion and tore off more. ",2525,2626
33,"The hunter and his wife were surprised at such rude and unaccountable conduct, but they remained silent, for they respected their guests, and had observed that they had been attended with marked good luck during the sojourn of these mysterious visitors in their lodge. ",2626,2895
34,"In other respects, the deportment of the females was strictly unexceptionable. ",2895,2974
35,"They were modest, distant, and silent. ",2974,3013
36,They never uttered a word during the day. ,3013,3055
37,"At night they would occupy themselves in procuring wood, which they carried to the lodge, and then, restoring the implements exactly where they had found them, resume their places without speaking. ",3055,3253
38,They were never known to stay out until daylight. ,3253,3303
39,They never laughed or jested. ,3303,3333
40,"The winter was nearly passed away, when, one evening, the hunter was abroad later than usual. ",3333,3427
41,"The moment he came in and laid down his day's hunt, as was his custom, before his wife, the two females seized upon the deer and began to tear off the fat in so unceremonious a way that her anger was excited. ",3427,3636
42,"She constrained herself, however, in a good degree, but she could not conceal her feelings, though she said but little. ",3636,3756
43,"The strange guests observed the state of her mind, and they became uneasy, and withdrew further still into the remote gloom of the lodge. ",3756,3894
44,"The good hunter saw the eclipse that was darkening the quiet of his lodge, and carefully inquired of its cause; ",3894,4006
45, but his wife denied having used any words of complaining or reproach. ,4005,4076
46,"They retired to their couches, and the hunter tried to compose himself to sleep, but could not, for the sighs and sobs of the two females were incessant. ",4076,4230
47,"He arose on his couch and addressed them as follows: ""Tell me,"" said he, ""what is it that gives you pain of mind and causes you to bemoan your presence here. ",4230,4388
48,"Has my wife given you offense, or trespassed upon the rights of hospitality?"" ",4388,4466
49,They replied in the negative. ,4466,4496
50,"""We have been treated by you with kindness and affection. ",4496,4554
51,It is not for any slight we have received that we weep. ,4554,4610
52,Our mission is not to you only. ,4610,4642
53,"We come from the other land to test mankind, and to try the sincerity of the living. ",4642,4727
54,"Often we have heard the bereaved by death say that if the lost could be restored, they would devote their lives to make them happy. ",4727,4859
55,"We have been moved by the bitter lamentations which have reached the place of the departed, and have come to make proof of the sincerity of those who have lost friends. ",4859,5028
56,We are your two dead sisters. ,5028,5058
57,Three moons were allotted us by the Master of Life to make the trial. ,5058,5128
58,"More than half the time had been successfully passed, when the angry feelings of your wife indicated the irksomeness you felt at our presence, and has made us resolve on our departure."" ",5128,5314
59,"They continued to talk to the hunter and his wife, gave them instructions as to a future life, and pronounced a blessing upon them. ",5314,5446
60,"""There is one point,"" they added, ""of which we wish to speak. ",5446,5508
61,You have thought our conduct very strange and rude in possessing ourselves of the choicest parts of your hunt. ,5508,5619
62,_That_ was the point of trial selected to put you to. ,5619,5673
63,It is the wife's peculiar privilege. ,5673,5710
64,You love your wife. ,5710,5730
65,"For another to usurp what belongs to her, we know to be the severest test of her goodness of heart, and consequently of your temper and feelings. ",5730,5876
66,"We knew your manners and customs, but we came to prove you, not by complying with but by violating them. ",5876,5981
67,Pardon us. ,5981,5992
68,We are the agents of him who sent us. ,5992,6030
69,Peace to your dwelling. ,6030,6054
70,"Farewell!"" ",6054,6065
71,"When they ceased, total darkness filled the lodge. ",6065,6116
72,No object could be seen. ,6116,6141
73,"The inmates heard the lodge-door open and shut, but they never saw more of the Two Spirits. ",6141,6233
74,The hunter found the success which they had promised. ,6233,6287
75,"He became celebrated in the chase, and never wanted for any thing. ",6287,6354
76,"He had many children, all of whom grew up to manhood; ",6354,6408
77," and he who had lain in the lodge, a little child, while the Jeebi dwelt there, led them in all good deeds, and health, peace, and long life were the rewards of the hunter's hospitality.",6407,6594
