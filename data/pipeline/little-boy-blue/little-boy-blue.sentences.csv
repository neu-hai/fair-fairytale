0,There once lived a poor widow who supported herself and her only son by gleaning in the fields the stalks of grain that had been missed by the reapers. ,0,152
1,"Her little cottage was at the foot of a beautiful valley, upon the edge of the river that wound in and out among the green hills; ",152,282
2," and although poor, she was contented with her lot, for her home was pleasant and her lovely boy was a constant delight to her. ",281,409
3,"He had big blue eyes, and fair golden curls, and he loved his good mother very dearly, and was never more pleased than when she allowed him to help her with her work. ",409,576
4,"And so the years passed happily away till the boy was eight years old, but then the widow fell sick, and their little store of money melted gradually away. ",576,732
5,"""I don't know what we shall do for bread,"" she said, kissing her boy with tears in her eyes, ""for I am not yet strong enough to work, and we have no money left."" ",732,894
6,"""But I can work,"" answered the boy; ",894,930
7," ""and I'm sure if I go to the Squire up at the Hall he will give me something to do."" ",929,1015
8,"At first the widow was reluctant to consent to this, since she loved to keep her child at her side, but finally, as nothing else could be done, she decided to let him go to see the Squire. ",1015,1204
9,"Being too proud to allow her son to go to the great house in his ragged clothes, she made him a new suit out of a pretty blue dress she had herself worn in happier times, and when it was finished and the boy dressed in it, he looked as pretty as a prince in a fairy tale. ",1204,1476
10,"For the bright blue jacket set off his curls to good advantage, and the color just matched the blue of his eyes. ",1476,1589
11,"His trousers were blue, also, and she took the silver buckles from her own shoes and put them on his, that he might appear the finer. ",1589,1723
12,And then she brushed his curls and placed his big straw hat upon them and sent him away with a kiss to see the Squire. ,1723,1842
13,"It so happened that the great man was walking in his garden with his daughter Madge that morning, and was feeling in an especially happy mood, so that when he suddenly looked up and saw a little boy before him, he said, kindly, ""Well, my child, what can I do for you?"" ",1842,2111
14,"""If you please, sir,"" said the boy, bravely, although he was frightened at meeting the Squire face to face, ""I want you to give me some work to do, so that I can earn money."" ",2111,2286
15,"""Earn money!"" ",2286,2300
16,"repeated the Squire, ""why do you wish to earn money?"" ",2300,2354
17,"""To buy food for my mother, sir. ",2354,2387
18,"We are very poor, and since she is no longer able to work for me I wish to work for her."" ",2387,2477
19,"""But what can you do?"" ",2477,2500
20,asked the Squire; ,2500,2518
21," ""you are too small to work in the fields."" ",2517,2561
22,"""I could earn something, sir, couldn't I?"" ",2561,2604
23,"His tone was so pleading that mistress Madge was unable to resist it, and even the Squire was touched. ",2604,2707
24,"The young lady came forward and took the boy's hand in her own, and pressing back his curls, she kissed his fair cheek. ",2707,2827
25,"""You shall be our shepherd,"" she said, pleasantly, ""and keep the sheep out of the meadows and the cows from getting into the corn. ",2827,2958
26,"You know, father,"" she continued, turning to the Squire, ""it was only yesterday you said you must get a boy to tend the sheep, and this little boy can do it nicely."" ",2958,3124
27,"""Very well,"" replied the Squire, ""it shall be as you say, and if he is attentive and watchful he will be able to save me a good bit of trouble and so really earn his money."" ",3124,3298
28,"Then he turned to the child and said, ""Come to me in the morning, my little man, and I will give you a silver horn to blow, that you may call the sheep and the cows whenever they go astray. ",3298,3488
29,"What is your name?"" ",3488,3508
30,"""Oh, never mind his name, papa!"" ",3508,3541
31,broke in the Squire's daughter; ,3541,3573
32," ""I shall call him Little Boy Blue, since he is dressed in blue from head to foot, and his dress but matches his eyes. ",3572,3691
33,"And you must give him a good wage, also, for surely no Squire before ever had a prettier shepherd boy than this."" ",3691,3805
34,"""Very good,"" said the Squire, cheerfully, as he pinched his daughter's rosy cheek; ",3805,3888
35," ""be watchful, Little Boy Blue, and you shall be well paid."" ",3887,3948
36,"Then Little Boy Blue thanked them both very sweetly and ran back over the hill and into the valley where his home lay nestled by the river-side, to tell the good news to his mother. ",3948,4130
37,"The poor widow wept tears of joy when she heard his story, and smiled when he told her that his name was to be Little Boy Blue. ",4130,4258
38,She knew the Squire was a kind master and would be good to her darling son. ,4258,4334
39,"Early the next morning Little Boy Blue was at the Hall, and the Squire's steward gave him a new silver horn, that glistened brightly in the sunshine, and a golden cord to fasten it around his neck. ",4334,4532
40,"And then he was given charge of the sheep and the cows, and told to keep them from straying into the meadowlands and the fields of grain. ",4532,4670
41,"It was not hard work, but just suited to Little Boy Blue's age, and he was watchful and vigilant and made a very good shepherd boy indeed. ",4670,4809
42,"His mother needed food no longer, for the Squire paid her son liberally and the Squire's daughter made a favorite of the small shepherd and loved to hear the call of his silver horn echoing amongst the hills. ",4809,5018
43,"Even the sheep and the cows were fond of him, and always obeyed the sound of his horn; ",5018,5105
44," therefore the Squire's corn thrived finely, and was never trampled. ",5104,5173
45,"Little Boy Blue was now very happy, and his mother was proud and contented and began to improve in health. ",5173,5280
46,After a few weeks she became strong enough to leave the cottage and walk a little in the fields each day; ,5280,5386
47," but she could not go far, because her limbs were too feeble to support her long, so the most she could attempt was to walk as far as the stile to meet Little Boy Blue as he came home from work in the evening. ",5385,5595
48,"Then she would lean on his shoulder and return to the cottage with him, and the boy was very glad he could thus support his darling mother and assist her faltering steps. ",5595,5766
49,"But one day a great misfortune came upon them, since it is true that no life can be so happy but that sorrow will creep in to temper it. ",5766,5903
50,"Little Boy Blue came homeward one evening very light of heart and whistled merrily as he walked, for he thought he should find his mother awaiting him at the stile and a good supper spread upon the table in the little cottage. ",5903,6130
51,"But when he came to the stile his mother was not in sight, and in answer to his call a low moan of pain reached his ears. ",6130,6252
52,"Little Boy Blue sprang over the stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother, her face white and drawn with suffering, and tears of anguish running down her cheeks. ",6252,6426
53,"For she had slipped upon the stile and fallen, and her leg was broken! ",6426,6497
54,"Little Boy Blue ran to the cottage for water and bathed the poor woman's face, and raised her head that she might drink. ",6497,6618
55,"There were no neighbors, for the cottage stood all alone by the river, so the child was obliged to support his mother in his arms as best he could while she crawled painfully back to the cottage. ",6618,6814
56,"Fortunately, it was not far, and at last she was safely laid upon her bed. ",6814,6889
57,Then Little Boy Blue began to think what he should do next. ,6889,6949
58,"""Can I leave you alone while I go for the doctor, mamma?"" ",6949,7007
59,"he asked, anxiously, as he held her clasped hands tightly in his two little ones. ",7007,7089
60,His mother drew him towards her and kissed him. ,7089,7137
61,"""Take the boat, dear,"" she said, ""and fetch the doctor from the village. ",7137,7210
62,"I shall be patient till you return."" ",7210,7247
63,Little Boy Blue rushed away to the river bank and unfastened the little boat; ,7247,7325
64, and then he pulled sturdily down the river until he passed the bend and came to the pretty village below. ,7324,7431
65,"When he had found the doctor and told of his mother's misfortune, the good man promised to attend him at once, and very soon they were seated in the boat and on their way to the cottage. ",7431,7618
66,"It was very dark by this time, but Little Boy Blue knew every turn and bend in the river, and the doctor helped him pull at the oars, so that at last they came to the place where a faint light twinkled through the cottage window. ",7618,7848
67,"They found the poor woman in much pain, but the doctor quickly set and bandaged her leg, and gave her some medicine to ease her suffering. ",7848,7987
68,It was nearly midnight when all was finished and the doctor was ready to start back to the village. ,7987,8087
69,"""Take good care of your mother,"" he said to the boy, ""and don't worry about her, for it is not a bad break and the leg will mend nicely in time; ",8087,8232
70," but she will be in bed many days, and you must nurse her as well as you are able."" ",8231,8315
71,"All through the night the boy sat by the bedside, bathing his mother's fevered brow and ministering to her wants. ",8315,8429
72,"And when the day broke she was resting easily and the pain had left her, and she told Little Boy Blue he must go to his work. ",8429,8555
73,"""For,"" said she, ""more than ever now we need the money you earn from the Squire, as my misfortune will add to the expenses of living, and we have the doctor to pay. ",8555,8720
74,"Do not fear to leave me, for I shall rest quietly and sleep most of the time while you are away."" ",8720,8818
75,"Little Boy Blue did not like to leave his mother all alone, but he knew of no one he could ask to stay with her; ",8818,8931
76," so he placed food and water by her bedside, and ate a little breakfast himself, and started off to tend his sheep. ",8930,9046
77,"The sun was shining brightly, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees, and the crickets chirped just as[38] merrily as if this great trouble had not come to Little Boy Blue to make him sad. ",9046,9236
78,"But he went bravely to his work, and for several hours he watched carefully; ",9236,9313
79," and the men at work in the fields, and the Squire's daughter, who sat embroidering upon the porch of the great house, heard often the sound of his horn as he called the straying sheep to his side. ",9312,9510
80,"But he had not slept the whole night, and he was tired with his long watch at his mother's bedside, and so in spite of himself the lashes would droop occasionally over his blue eyes, for he was only a child, and children feel the loss of sleep more than older people. ",9510,9778
81,"Still, Little Boy Blue had no intention of sleeping while he was on duty, and bravely fought against the drowsiness that was creeping over him. ",9778,9922
82,"The sun shone very hot that day, and he walked to the shady side of a big haystack and sat down upon the ground, leaning his back against the stack. ",9922,10071
83,"The cows and sheep were quietly browsing near him, and he watched them earnestly for a time, listening to the singing of the birds, and the gentle tinkling of the bells upon the wethers, and the far-away songs of the reapers that the breeze brought to his ears. ",10071,10333
84,"And before he knew it the blue eyes had closed fast, and the golden head lay back upon the hay, and Little Boy Blue was fast asleep and dreaming that his mother was well again and had come to the stile to meet him. ",10333,10548
85,"The sheep strayed near the edge of the meadow and paused, waiting for the warning sound of the horn. ",10548,10649
86,And the breeze carried the fragrance of the growing corn to the nostrils of the browsing cows and tempted them nearer and nearer to the forbidden feast. ,10649,10802
87,"But the silver horn was silent, and before long the cows were feeding upon the Squire's pet cornfield and the sheep were enjoying themselves amidst the juicy grasses of the meadows. ",10802,10984
88,"The Squire himself was returning from a long, weary ride over his farms, and when he came to the cornfield and saw the cows trampling down the grain and feeding upon the golden stalks he was very angry. ",10984,11187
89,"""Little Boy Blue!"" ",11187,11206
90,he cried; ,11206,11216
91," ""ho! ",11215,11221
92,"Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn!"" ",11221,11260
93,But there was no reply. ,11260,11284
94,"He rode on a way and now discovered that the sheep were deep within the meadows, and that made him more angry still. ",11284,11401
95,"""Here, Isaac,"" he said to a farmer's lad who chanced to pass by, ""where is Little Boy Blue?"" ",11401,11494
96,"""He's under the hay-stack, your honor, fast asleep!"" ",11494,11547
97,"replied Isaac with a grin, for he had passed that way and seen that the boy was lying asleep. ",11547,11641
98,"""Will you go and wake him?"" ",11641,11669
99,asked the Squire; ,2500,2518
100," ""for he must drive out the sheep and the cows before they do more damage."" ",11686,11762
101,"""Not I,"" replied Isaac, ""if I wake him he'll surely cry, for he is but a baby, and not fit to mind the sheep. ",11762,11872
102,"But I myself will drive them out for your honor,"" and away he ran to do so, thinking that now the Squire would give him Little Boy Blue's place, and make him the shepherd boy, for Isaac had long coveted the position. ",11872,12089
103,"The Squire's daughter, hearing the angry tones of her father's voice, now came out to see what was amiss, and when she heard that Little Boy Blue had failed in his trust she was deeply grieved, for she had loved the child for his pretty ways. ",12089,12332
104,The Squire dismounted from his horse and came to where the boy was lying. ,12332,12406
105,"""Awake!"" ",12406,12415
106,"said he, shaking him by the shoulder, ""and depart from my lands, for you have betrayed my trust, and let the sheep and the cows stray into the fields and meadows!"" ",12415,12579
107,Little Boy Blue started up at once and rubbed his eyes; ,12579,12635
108," and then he did as Isaac prophesied, and began to weep bitterly, for his heart was sore that he had failed in his duty to the good Squire and so forfeited his confidence. ",12634,12806
109,"But the Squire's daughter was moved by the child's tears, so she took him upon her lap and comforted him, asking, ""Why did you sleep, Little Boy Blue, when you should have watched the cows and the sheep?"" ",12806,13011
110,"""My mother has broken her leg,"" answered the boy, between his sobs, ""and I did not sleep all last night, but sat by her bedside nursing her. ",13011,13152
111,"And I tried hard not to fall asleep, but could not help myself;[",13152,13216
112,"[41] and oh, Squire! ",13215,13236
113,"I hope you will forgive me this once, for my poor mother's sake!"" ",13236,13302
114,"""Where does your mother live?"" ",13302,13333
115,"asked the Squire, in a kindly tone, for he had already forgiven Little Boy Blue. ",13333,13414
116,"""In the cottage down by the river,"" answered the child; ",13414,13470
117," ""and she is all alone, for there is no one near to help us in our trouble."" ",13469,13546
118,"""Come,"" said Mistress Madge, rising to her feet and taking his hand; ",13546,13615
119," ""lead us to your home, and we will see if we cannot assist your poor mother."" ",13614,13693
120,"So the Squire and his daughter and Little Boy Blue all walked down to the little cottage, and the Squire had a long talk with the poor widow. ",13693,13835
121,"And that same day a big basket of dainties was sent to the cottage, and Mistress Madge bade her own maid go to the widow and nurse her carefully until she recovered. ",13835,14001
122,So that after all Little Boy Blue did more for his dear mother by falling asleep than he could had he kept wide awake; ,14001,14120
123," for after his mother was well again the Squire gave them a pretty cottage to live in very near to the great house itself, and the Squire's daughter was ever afterward their good friend, and saw that they wanted for no comforts of life. ",14119,14356
124,"And Little Boy Blue did not fall asleep again at his post, but watched the cows and the sheep faithfully for many years, until he grew up to manhood and had a farm of his own. ",14356,14532
125,"He always said his mother's accident had brought him good luck, but I think it was rather his own loving heart and his devotion to his mother that made him friends. ",14532,14697
126,For no one is afraid to trust a boy who loves to serve and care for his mother.,14697,14777
