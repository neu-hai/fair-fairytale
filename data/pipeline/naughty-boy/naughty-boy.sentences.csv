22,"He squeezed the water out of his dripping hair, warmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine. ",1540,1658
23,"Then the boy recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down from the lap where he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet. ",1658,1796

37,"""You see now that my bow was not spoiled,"" said he laughing; ",2406,2467
