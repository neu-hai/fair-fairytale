0,THERE was once a man who had three sons. ,0,41
1,"The youngest of them was called Dullhead, and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity. ",41,156
2,"One day it happened that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood, and before he started his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine, so that he might be sure not to suffer from hunger or thirst. ",156,381
3,"When he reached the forest he met a little old grey man who wished him 'Good-morning,' and said: 'Do give me a piece of that cake you have got in your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine-I am so hungry and thirsty.' ",381,608
4,But this clever son replied: 'If I give you my cake and wine I shall have none left for myself; ,608,704
5, you just go your own way;',703,730
6,' and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest. ,729,810
7,"There he began to cut down a tree, but before long he made a false stroke with his axe, and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up. ",810,980
8,"Then the second son went to the forest, and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother. ",980,1110
9,"He too met the little old grey man, who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine. ",1110,1205
10,"But the second son spoke most sensibly too, and said: 'Whatever I give to you I deprive myself of. ",1205,1304
11,"Just go your own way, will you?' ",1304,1337
12,"Not long after his punishment overtook him, for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe, than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home. ",1337,1512
13,"So then Dullhead said: 'Father, let me go out and cut wood.' ",1512,1573
14,But his father answered: 'Both your brothers have injured themselves. ,1573,1643
15,You had better leave it alone; ,1643,1674
16, you know nothing about it.' ,1673,1702
17,"But Dullhead begged so hard to be allowed to go that at last his father said: 'Very well, then-go. ",1702,1801
18,"Perhaps when you have hurt yourself, you may learn to know better.' ",1801,1869
19,"His mother only gave him a very plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and a bottle of sour beer. ",1869,1981
20,"When he got to the forest, he too met the little grey old man, who greeted him and said: 'Give me a piece of your cake and a draught from your bottle; ",1981,2132
21, I am so hungry and thirsty.' ,2131,2161
22,"And Dullhead replied: 'I've only got a cinder-cake and some sour beer, but if you care to have that, let us sit down and eat.' ",2161,2288
23,"So they sat down, and when Dullhead brought out his cake he found it had turned into a fine rich cake, and the sour beer into excellent wine. ",2288,2430
24,"Then they ate and drank, and when they had finished the little man said: 'Now I will bring you luck, because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others. ",2430,2613
25,There stands an old tree; ,2613,2639
26," cut it down, and amongst its roots you'll find something.' ",2638,2698
27,With that the little man took leave. ,2698,2735
28,"Then Dullhead fell to at once to hew down the tree, and when it fell he found amongst its roots a goose, whose feathers were all of pure gold. ",2735,2878
29,"He lifted it out, carried it off, and took it with him to an inn where he meant to spend the night. ",2878,2978
30,"Now the landlord of the inn had three daughters, and when they saw the goose they were filled with curiosity as to what this wonderful bird could be, and each longed to have one of its golden feathers. ",2978,3180
31,"The eldest thought to herself: 'No doubt I shall soon find a good opportunity to pluck out one of its feathers,' and the first time Dullhead happened to leave the room she caught hold of the goose by its wing. ",3180,3390
32,"But, lo and behold! ",3390,3410
33,"her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose, and she could not take her hand away. ",3410,3495
34,"Soon after the second daughter came in, and thought to pluck a golden feather for herself too; ",3495,3590
35, but hardly had she touched her sister than she stuck fast as well. ,3589,3657
36,"At last the third sister came with the same intentions, but the other two cried out: 'Keep off! ",3657,3753
37,"for Heaven's sake, keep off!' ",3753,3783
38,"The younger sister could not imagine why she was to keep off, and thought to herself: 'If they are both there, why should not I be there too?' ",3783,3926
39,So she sprang to them; ,3926,3949
40, but no sooner had she touched one of them than she stuck fast to her. ,3948,4019
41,So they all three had to spend the night with the goose. ,4019,4076
42,"Next morning Dullhead tucked the goose under his arm and went off, without in the least troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it. ",4076,4231
43,They just had to run after him right or left as best they could. ,4231,4296
44,"In the middle of a field they met the parson, and when he saw this procession he cried: 'For shame, you bold girls! ",4296,4412
45,What do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that? ,4412,4491
46,Do you call that proper behaviour?' ,4491,4527
47,And with that he caught the youngest girl by the hand to try and draw her away. ,4527,4607
48,"But directly he touched her he hung on himself, and had to run along with the rest of them. ",4607,4699
49,"Not long after the clerk came that way, and was much surprised to see the parson following the footsteps of three girls. ",4699,4820
50,"'Why, where is your reverence going so fast?' ",4820,4866
51,cried he; ,4866,4876
52, 'don't forget there is to be a christening to-day;',4875,4927
53,"' and he ran after him, caught him by the sleeve, and hung on to it himself: As the five of them trotted along in this fashion one after the other, two peasants were coming from their work with their hoes. ",4926,5132
54,On seeing them the parson called out and begged them to come and rescue him and the clerk. ,5132,5223
55,"But no sooner did they touch the clerk than they stuck on too, and so there were seven of them running after Dullhead and his goose. ",5223,5356
56,After a time they all came to a town where a King reigned whose daughter was so serious and solemn that no one could ever manage to make her laugh. ,5356,5504
57,So the King had decreed that whoever should succeed in making her laugh should marry her. ,5504,5594
58,"When Dullhead heard this he marched before the Princess with his goose and its appendages, and as soon as she saw these seven people continually running after each other she burst out laughing, and could not stop herself. ",5594,5816
59,"Then Dullhead claimed her as his bride, but the King, who did not much fancy him as a son-in-law, made all sorts of objections, and told him he must first find a man who could drink up a whole cellarful of wine. ",5816,6028
60,"Dullhead bethought him of the little grey man, who could, he felt sure, help him; ",6028,6110
61," so he went off to the forest, and on the very spot where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting with a most dismal expression of face. ",6109,6252
62,"Dullhead asked him what he was taking so much to heart, and the man answered: 'I don't know how I am ever to quench this terrible thirst I am suffering from. ",6252,6410
63,Cold water doesn't suit me at all. ,6410,6445
64,"To be sure I've emptied a whole barrel of wine, but what is one drop on a hot stone?' ",6445,6531
65,"'I think I can help you,' said Dullhead. ",6531,6572
66,"'Come with me, and you shall drink to your heart's content.' ",6572,6633
67,"So he took him to the King's cellar, and the man sat down before the huge casks and drank and drank till he drank up the whole contents of the cellar before the day closed. ",6633,6806
68,"Then Dullhead asked once more for his bride, but the King felt vexed at the idea of a stupid fellow whom people called 'Dullhead' carrying off his daughter, and he began to make fresh conditions. ",6806,7002
69,He required Dullhead to find a man who could eat a mountain of bread. ,7002,7072
70,"Dullhead did not wait to consider long but went straight off to the forest, and there on the same spot sat a man who was drawing in a strap as tight as he could round his body, and making a most woeful face the while. ",7072,7290
71,"Said he: 'I've eaten up a whole oven full of loaves, but what's the good of that to anyone who is as hungry as I am? ",7290,7407
72,"I declare my stomach feels quite empty, and I must draw my belt tight if I'm not to die of starvation.' ",7407,7511
73,"Dullhead was delighted, and said: 'Get up and come with me, and you shall have plenty to eat,' and he brought him to the King's Court. ",7511,7646
74,"Now the King had given orders to have all the flour in his kingdom brought together, and to have a huge mountain baked of it. ",7646,7772
75,"But the man from the wood just took up his stand before the mountain and began to eat, and in one day it had all vanished. ",7772,7895
76,"For the third time Dullhead asked for his bride, but again the King tried to make some evasion, and demanded a ship 'which could sail on land or water! ",7895,8047
77,"When you come sailing in such a ship,' said he, 'you shall have my daughter without further delay.' ",8047,8147
78,"Again Dullhead started off to the forest, and there he found the little old grey man with whom he had shared his cake, and who said: 'I have eaten and I have drunk for you, and now I will give you the ship. ",8147,8354
79,I have done all this for you because you were kind and merciful to me.' ,8354,8426
80,"Then he gave Dullhead a ship which could sail on land or water, and when the King saw it he felt he could no longer refuse him his daughter. ",8426,8567
81,So they celebrated the wedding with great rejoicings; ,8567,8621
82," and after the King's death Dullhead succeeded to the kingdom, and lived happily with his wife for many years after.",8620,8737
