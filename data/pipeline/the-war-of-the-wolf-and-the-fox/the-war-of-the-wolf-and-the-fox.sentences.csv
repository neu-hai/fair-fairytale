0,There was once upon a time a man and his wife who had an old cat and an old dog. ,0,81
1,"One day the man, whose name was Simon, said to his wife, whose name was Susan, 'Why should we keep our old cat any longer? ",81,204
2,"She never catches any mice now-a-days, and is so useless that I have made up my mind to drown her.' ",204,304
3,"But his wife replied, 'Don't do that, for I'm sure she could still catch mice.' ",304,384
4,"'Rubbish,' said Simon. ",384,407
5,'The mice might dance on her and she would never catch one. ,407,467
6,"I've quite made up my mind that the next time I see her, I shall put her in the water.' ",467,555
7,"Susan was very unhappy when she heard this, and so was the cat, who had been listening to the conversation behind the stove. ",555,680
8,"When Simon went off to his work, the poor cat miawed so pitifully, and looked up so pathetically into Susan's face, that the woman quickly opened the door. ",680,836
9,"She said, 'Fly for your life, my poor little beast, and get well away from here before your master returns.' ",836,945
10,"The cat took her advice, and ran as quickly as her poor old legs would carry her into the wood. ",945,1041
11,"When Simon came home, his wife told him that the cat had vanished. ",1041,1108
12,"'So much the better for her,' said Simon. ",1108,1150
13,"'And now we have got rid of her, we must consider what we are to do with the old dog. ",1150,1236
14,"He is quite deaf and blind, and invariably barks when there is no need, and makes no sound when there is. ",1236,1342
15,I think the best thing I can do with him is to hang him.' ,1342,1400
16,"But soft-hearted Susan replied, 'Please don't do so. ",1400,1453
17,He's surely not so useless as all that.' ,1453,1494
18,"'Don't be foolish,' said her husband. ",1494,1532
19,'The courtyard might be full of thieves and he'd never discover it. ,1532,1600
20,"No, the first time I see him, it's all up with him, I can tell you.' ",1600,1669
21,"Susan was very unhappy at his words, and so was the dog, who was lying in the corner of the room and had heard everything. ",1669,1792
22,"As soon as Simon had gone to his work, he stood up and howled so touchingly that Susan quickly opened the door. ",1792,1904
23,"She said 'Fly for your life, poor beast, before your master gets home.' ",1904,1976
24,And the dog ran into the wood with his tail between his legs. ,1976,2038
25,"When her husband returned, his wife told him that the dog had disappeared. ",2038,2113
26,"'That's lucky for him,' said Simon, but Susan sighed, for she had been very fond of the poor creature. ",2113,2216
27,Now it happened that the cat and dog met each other on their travels. ,2216,2286
28,"Though they had not been the best of friends at home, they were quite glad to meet among strangers. ",2286,2386
29,They sat down under a holly tree and both poured forth their woes. ,2386,2453
30,"Presently a fox passed by, and saw the pair sitting together in a disconsolate fashion. ",2453,2541
31,"He asked them why they sat there, and what they were grumbling about. ",2541,2611
32,"The cat replied, 'I have caught many a mouse in my day. ",2611,2667
33,"Now that I am old and past work, my master wants to drown me.' ",2667,2730
34,"And the dog said, 'Many a night have I watched and guarded my master's house. ",2730,2808
35,"Now that I am old and deaf, he wants to hang me.' ",2808,2858
36,"The fox answered, 'That's the way of the world. ",2858,2906
37,"But I'll help you to get back into your master's favour, only you must first help me in my own troubles.' ",2906,3012
38,"They promised to do their best, and the fox continued, 'The wolf has declared war against me, and is at this moment marching to meet me in company with the bear and the wild boar. ",3012,3192
39,To-morrow there will be a fierce battle between us.' ,3192,3245
40,"'All right,' said the dog and the cat, 'we will stand by you, and if we are killed, it is at any rate better to die on the field of battle than to perish ignobly at home,' and they shook paws and concluded the bargain. ",3245,3464
41,"The fox sent word to the wolf to meet him at a certain place, and the three set forth to encounter him and his friends. ",3464,3584
42,"The wolf, the bear, and the wild boar arrived on the spot first, and when they had waited some time for the fox, the dog, and the cat, the bear said, 'I'll climb up into the oak tree, and look if I can see them coming.' ",3584,3804
43,"The first time he looked round he said, 'I can see nothing.' ",3804,3865
44,"The second time he looked round he said, 'I can still see nothing.' ",3865,3933
45,"But the third time he said, 'I see a mighty army in the distance, and one of the warriors has the biggest lance you ever saw!' ",3933,4060
46,"This was the cat, who was marching along with her tail erect. ",4060,4122
47,"And so they laughed and jeered, and it was so hot that the bear said, 'The enemy won't be here at this rate for many hours to come. ",4122,4254
48,I'll just curl myself up in the fork of the tree and have a little sleep.' ,4254,4329
49,"And the wolf lay down under the oak, and the wild boar buried himself in some straw, so that nothing was seen of him but one ear. ",4329,4459
50,"And while they were lying there, the fox, the cat and the dog arrived. ",4459,4530
51,"When the cat saw the wild boar's ear, she pounced upon it, thinking it was a mouse in the straw. ",4530,4627
52,"The wild boar got up in a dreadful fright, gave one loud grunt and disappeared into the wood. ",4627,4721
53,"But the cat was even more startled than the boar, and, spitting with terror, she scrambled up into the fork of the tree, and as it happened right into the bear's face. ",4721,4889
54,"Now it was the bear's turn to be alarmed, and with a mighty growl he jumped down from the oak and fell right on the top of the wolf and killed him as dead as a stone. ",4889,5056
55,"On their way home from the war the fox caught score of mice, and when they reached Simon's cottage he put them all on the stove and said to the cat, 'Now go and fetch one mouse after the other, and lay them down before your master.' ",5056,5289
56,"'All right,' said the cat, and did exactly as the fox told her. ",5289,5353
57,"When Susan saw this she said to her husband, 'Just look, here is our old cat back again, and see what a lot of mice she has caught.' ",5353,5486
58,"'Wonders will never cease,' cried Simon. ",5486,5527
59,'I certainly never thought the old cat would ever catch another mouse.' ,5527,5599
60,"But Susan answered, 'There, you see, I always said our cat was a most excellent creature--but you men always think you know best.' ",5599,5730
61,"In the meantime the fox said to the dog, 'Our friend Simon has just killed a pig. ",5730,5812
62,"When it gets a little darker, you must go into the courtyard and bark with all your might.' ",5812,5904
63,"'All right,' said the dog, and as soon as it grew dusk he began to bark loudly. ",5904,5984
64,"Susan, who heard him first, said to her husband, 'Our dog must have come back, for I hear him barking lustily. ",5984,6095
65,Do go out and see what's the matter. ,6095,6132
66,Perhaps thieves may be stealing our sausages.' ,6132,6179
67,"But Simon answered, 'The foolish brute is as deaf as a post and is always barking at nothing,' and he refused to get up. ",6179,6300
68,"The next morning Susan got up early to go to church at the neighbouring town, and she thought she would take some sausages to her aunt who lived there. ",6300,6452
69,"But when she went to her larder, she found all the sausages gone, and a great hole in the floor. ",6452,6549
70,"She called out to her husband, 'I was perfectly right. ",6549,6604
71,"Thieves have been here last night, and they have not left a single sausage. ",6604,6680
72,Oh! ,6680,6684
73,if you had only got up when I asked you to!' ,6684,6729
74,"Then Simon scratched his head and said, 'I can't understand it at all. ",6729,6800
75,I certainly never believed the old dog was so quick at hearing.' ,6800,6865
76,"But Susan replied, 'I always told you our old dog was the best dog in the world--but as usual you thought you knew so much better. ",6865,6996
77,Men are the same all the world over.' ,6996,7034
78,"And the fox scored a point too, for he had carried away the sausages himself!",7034,7112
