0,"There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. ",0,123
1,"They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue. ",123,220
2,"The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, ""Tin soldiers!"" ",220,297
3,"uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off. ",297,416
4,"They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. ",416,502
5,"The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; ",502,576
6," he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable. ",575,757
7,"The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle. ",757,904
8,Through the small windows the rooms could be seen. ,904,955
9,"In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake. ",955,1092
10,"Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake, and were reflected in it. ",1092,1156
11,"All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; ",1156,1273
12," she, also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf. ",1272,1405
13,"In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face. ",1405,1487
14,"The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg. ",1487,1693
15,"""That is the wife for me,"" he thought; ",1693,1732
16," ""but she is too grand, and lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether, that is no place for her. ",1731,1874
17,"Still I must try and make her acquaintance."" ",1874,1919
18,"Then he laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff-box that stood upon it, so that he could peep at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance. ",1919,2120
19,"When evening came, the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box, and the people of the house went to bed. ",2120,2231
20,"Then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls. ",2231,2346
21,The tin soldiers rattled in their box; ,2346,2385
22," they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid. ",2384,2466
23,"The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table. ",2466,2543
24,"There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. ",2543,2628
25,Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places. ,2628,2690
26,"She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. ",2690,2776
27,He never took his eyes from her for even a moment. ,2776,2827
28,"The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; ",2827,2908
29," but, instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin; ",2907,2970
30, for the snuff-box was a toy puzzle. ,2969,3006
31,"""Tin soldier,"" said the goblin, ""don't wish for what does not belong to you."" ",3006,3084
32,But the tin soldier pretended not to hear. ,3084,3127
33,"""Very well; ",3127,3139
34," wait till to-morrow, then,"" said the goblin. ",3138,3184
35,"When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin soldier in the window. ",3184,3271
36,"Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the street beneath. ",3271,3464
37,It was a terrible fall; ,3464,3488
38," for he came head downwards his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. ",3487,3606
39,The servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; ,3606,3685
40," but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him. ",3684,3757
41,"If he had called out, ""Here I am,"" it would have been all right, but he was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform. ",3757,3888
42,"Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and faster, till there was a heavy shower. ",3888,3985
43,"When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, ""Look, there is a tin soldier. ",3985,4086
44,"He ought to have a boat to sail in."" ",4086,4123
45,"So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands. ",4123,4302
46,"Good gracious, what large waves arose in that gutter! ",4302,4356
47,and how fast the stream rolled on! ,4356,4391
48,for the rain had been very heavy. ,4391,4425
49,"The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; ",4425,4536
50, yet he remained firm; ,4535,4558
51, his countenance did not change; ,4557,4590
52," he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket. ",4589,4648
53,"Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier's box. ",4648,4768
54,"""Where am I going now?"" ",4768,4792
55,thought he. ,4792,4804
56,"""This is the black goblin's fault, I am sure. ",4804,4850
57,"Ah, well, if the little lady were only here with me in the boat, I should not care for any darkness."" ",4850,4952
58,"Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain. ",4952,5019
59,"""Have you a passport?"" ",5019,5042
60,"asked the rat, ""give it to me at once."" ",5042,5082
61,But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever. ,5082,5157
62,The boat sailed on and the rat followed it. ,5157,5201
63,"How he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, ""Stop him, stop him; ",5201,5292
64," he has not paid toll, and has not shown his pass."" ",5291,5343
65,But the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. ,5343,5391
66,The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended. ,5391,5464
67,Then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man. ,5464,5545
68,"At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us. ",5545,5690
69,"He was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldier could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was not afraid. ",5690,5876
70,"The boat whirled round three or four times, and then filled with water to the very edge; ",5876,5965
71, nothing could save it from sinking. ,5964,6001
72,"He now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier's head. ",6001,6183
73,"He thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears--""Farewell, warrior! ",6183,6322
74,"ever brave, Drifting onward to thy grave."" ",6322,6365
75,"Then the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank into the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish. ",6365,6498
76,Oh how dark it was inside the fish! ,6498,6534
77,"A great deal darker than in the tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued firm, and lay at full length shouldering his musket. ",6534,6675
78,"The fish swam to and fro, making the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quite still. ",6675,6773
79,"After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him, and then the daylight approached, and a voice cried out, ""I declare here is the tin soldier."" ",6773,6931
80,"The fish had been caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. ",6931,7066
81,"She picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room. ",7066,7179
82,They were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had travelled about inside a fish; ,7179,7270
83, but he was not at all proud. ,7269,7299
84,"They placed him on the table, and--how many curious things do happen in the world!--there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; ",7299,7598
85," she still balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself. ",7597,7691
86,"It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back. ",7691,7791
87,He only looked at her and they both remained silent. ,7791,7844
88,"Presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier, and threw him into the stove. ",7844,7932
89,"He had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box. ",7932,8049
90,"The flames lighted up the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible, but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell. ",8049,8217
91,"Then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say. ",8217,8396
92,"He looked at the little lady, and she looked at him. ",8396,8449
93,"He felt himself melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder. ",8449,8536
94,"Suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught of air caught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph right into the stove by the side of the tin soldier, and was instantly in flames and was gone. ",8536,8750
95,"The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the next morning, when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. ",8750,8918
96,"But of the little dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, which was burnt black as a cinder.",8918,9016
