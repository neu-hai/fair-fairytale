0,Once upon a time there was a descendant of Confucius. ,0,54
1,"His father had a friend, and this friend held an official position in the South and offered the young man a place as secretary. ",54,182
2,"But when the latter reached the town where he was to have been active, he found that his father's friend had already died. ",182,305
3,"Then he was much embarrassed, seeing that he did not have the means to return home again. ",305,395
4,"So he was glad to take refuge in the Monastery of Puto, where he copied holy books for the abbot. ",395,493
5,About a hundred paces west of the monastery stood a deserted house. ,493,561
6,"One day there had been a great snowfall, and as young Kung accidentally passed by the door of the house, he noticed a well dressed and prepossessing youth standing there who bowed to him and begged him to approach. ",561,776
7,"Now young Kung was a scholar, and could appreciate good manners. ",776,841
8,"Finding that the youth and himself had much in common, he took a liking to him, and followed him into the house. ",841,954
9,It was immaculately clean; ,954,981
10," silk curtains hung before the doors, and on the walls were pictures of good old masters. ",980,1070
11,"On a table lay a book entitled: ""Tales of the Coral Ring."" ",1070,1129
12,Coral Ring was the name of a cavern. ,1129,1166
13,Once upon a time there lived a monk at Puto who was exceedingly learned. ,1166,1239
14,"An aged man had led him into the cave in question, where he had seen a number of volumes on the book stands. ",1239,1348
15,"The aged man had said: ""These are the histories of the various dynasties."" ",1348,1423
16,In a second room were to be found the histories of all the peoples on earth. ,1423,1500
17,A third was guarded by two dogs. ,1500,1533
18,"The aged man explained: ""In this room are kept the secret reports of the immortals, telling the arts by means of which they gained eternal life. ",1533,1678
19,"The two dogs are two dragons."" ",1678,1709
20,"The monk turned the pages of the books, and found that they were all works of ancient times, such as he had never seen before. ",1709,1836
21,"He would gladly have remained in the cave, but the old man said: ""That would not do!"" ",1836,1922
22,and a boy led him out again. ,1922,1951
23,"The name of that cave, however, was the Coral Ring, and it was described in the volume which lay on the table. ",1951,2062
24,"The youth questioned Kung regarding his name and family, and the latter told him his whole history. ",2062,2162
25,The youth pitied him greatly and advised him to open a school. ,2162,2225
26,"Kung answered with a sigh: ""I am quite unknown in the neighborhood, and have no one to recommend me!"" ",2225,2327
27,"Said the youth: ""If you do not consider me altogether too unworthy and stupid, I should like to be your pupil myself."" ",2327,2446
28,Young Kung was overjoyed. ,2446,2472
29,"""I should not dare to attempt to teach you,"" he replied, ""but together we might dedicate ourselves to the study of science."" ",2472,2597
30,He then asked why the house had been standing empty for so long. ,2597,2662
31,"The youth answered: ""The owner of the house has gone to the country. ",2662,2731
32,"We come from Shensi, and have taken the house for a short time. ",2731,2795
33,"We only moved in a few days ago."" ",2795,2829
34,"They chatted and joked together gaily, and the young man invited Kung to remain overnight, ordering a small boy to light a pan of charcoal. ",2829,2969
35,"Then he stepped rapidly into the rear room and soon returned saying: ""My father has come."" ",2969,3060
36,"As Kung rose an aged man with a long, white beard and eyebrows stepped into the room and said, greeting him: ""You have already declared your willingness to instruct my son, and I am grateful for your kindness. ",3060,3270
37,"But you must be strict with him and not treat him as a friend."" ",3270,3334
38,"Then he had garments of silk, a fur cap, and shoes and socks of fur brought in, and begged Kung to change his clothes. ",3334,3453
39,Wine and food were then served. ,3453,3485
40,"The cushions and covers of the tables and chairs were made of stuffs unknown to Kung, and their shimmering radiance blinded the eye. ",3485,3618
41,"The aged man retired after a few beakers of wine, and then the youth showed Kung his essays. ",3618,3711
42,They were all written in the style of the old masters and not in the new-fangled eight-section form. ,3711,3812
43,"When he was asked about this, the youth said with a smile: ""I am quite indifferent to winning success at the state examinations!"" ",3812,3942
44,"Then he turned to the small boy and said: ""See whether the old gentleman has already fallen asleep. ",3942,4042
45,"If he has, you may quietly bring in little Hiang-Nu."" ",4042,4096
46,"The boy went off, and the youth took a lute from an embroidered case. ",4096,4166
47,"At once a serving-maid entered, dressed in red, and surpassingly beautiful. ",4166,4242
48,"The youth bade her sing ""The Lament of the Beloved,"" and her melting tones moved the heart. ",4242,4334
49,The third watch of the night had passed before they retired to sleep. ,4334,4404
50,On the following morning all rose early and study began. ,4404,4461
51,The youth was exceptionally gifted. ,4461,4497
52,Whatever he had seen but once was graven in his memory. ,4497,4553
53,Hence he made surprising progress in the course of a few months. ,4553,4618
54,"The old custom was followed of writing an essay every five days, and celebrating its completion with a little banquet. ",4618,4737
55,And at each banquet Hiang-Nu was sent for. ,4737,4780
56,One evening Kung could not remove his glance from Hiang-Nu. ,4780,4840
57,"The youth guessed his thoughts and said to him: ""You are as yet unmarried. ",4840,4915
58,Early and late I keep thinking as to how I can provide you with a charming life companion. ,4915,5006
59,"Hiang-Nu is the serving-maid of my father, so I cannot give her to you."" ",5006,5079
60,"Said Kung: ""I am grateful to you for your friendly thought. ",5079,5139
61,"But if the girl you have in mind is not just as beautiful as Hiang-Nu, then I would rather do without."" ",5139,5243
62,"The youth laughed: ""You are indeed inexperienced if you think that Hiang-Nu is beautiful. ",5243,5333
63,"Your wish is easily fulfilled."" ",5333,5365
64,Thus half a year went by and the monotonous rainy season had just began. ,5365,5438
65,"Then a swelling the size of a peach developed in young Kung's breast, which increased over night until it was as large as a tea-cup. ",5438,5571
66,"He lay on his couch groaning with pain, and unable to eat or to sleep. ",5571,5642
67,"The youth was busy day and night nursing him, and even the old gentleman asked how he was getting along. ",5642,5747
68,"Then the youth said: ""My little sister Giauna alone is able to cure this illness. ",5747,5829
69,"Please send to grandmother, and have her brought here!"" ",5829,5885
70,"The old gentleman was willing, and he sent off his boy. ",5885,5941
71,"The next day the boy came back with the news that Giauna would come, together with her aunt and her cousin A-Sung. ",5941,6056
72,Not long after the youth led his sister into the room. ,6056,6111
73,"She was not more than thirteen or fourteen years of age, enchantingly beautiful, and slender as a willow-tree. ",6111,6222
74,When the sick man saw her he forgot all his pain and his spirits rose. ,6222,6293
75,"The youth said to his sister Giauna: ""This is my best friend, whom I love as a brother! ",6293,6381
76,"I beg of you, little sister, to cure him of his illness!"" ",6381,6439
77,The maiden blushed with confusion; ,6439,6474
78, then she stepped up to the sick-bed. ,6473,6511
79,"While she was feeling his pulse, it seemed to him as though she brought the fragrance of orchards with her. ",6511,6619
80,"Said the maiden with a smile: ""No wonder that this illness has befallen him. ",6619,6696
81,His heart beats far too stormily. ,6696,6730
82,His illness is serious but not incurable. ,6730,6772
83,"Now the blood which has flowed has already gathered, so we will have to cut to cure."" ",6772,6858
84,With that she took her golden armlet from her arm and laid it on the aching place. ,6858,6941
85,"She pressed it down very gently, and the swelling rose a full inch above the armlet so that it enclosed the entire swelling. ",6941,7066
86,Then she loosed a pen-knife with a blade as thin as paper from her silken girdle. ,7066,7148
87,"With one hand she held the armlet, and with the other she took the knife and lightly passed it around the bottom of the ring. ",7148,7274
88,Black blood gushed forth and ran over mattress and bed. ,7274,7330
89,"But young Kung was so enchanted by the presence of the beautiful Giauna that not only did he feel no pain, but his one fear was that the whole affair might end too soon, and that she would disappear from his sight. ",7330,7545
90,"In a moment the diseased flesh had been cut away, and Giauna had fresh water brought and cleansed the wound. ",7545,7654
91,"Then she took a small red pellet from her mouth, and laid it on the wound, and when she turned around in a circle, it seemed to Kung as though she drew out all the inflammation in steam and flames. ",7654,7852
92,"Once more she turned in a circle, and he felt his wound itch and quiver, and when she turned for the third time, he was completely cured. ",7852,7990
93,"The maiden took the pellet into her mouth again and said: ""Now all is well!"" ",7990,8067
94,Then she hastened into the inner room. ,8067,8106
95,Young Kung leaped up in order to thank her. ,8106,8150
96,"True, he was now cured of his illness, but his thoughts continued to dwell on Giauna's pretty face. ",8150,8250
97,He neglected his books and sat lost in day-dreams. ,8250,8301
98,"His friend had noticed it and said to him: ""I have at last succeeded, this very day, in finding an attractive life companion for you."" ",8301,8436
99,Kung asked who she might be. ,8436,8465
100,"""The daughter of my aunt, A-Sung. ",8465,8499
101,"She is seventeen years of age, and anything but homely."" ",8499,8556
102,"""I am sure she is not as beautiful as Giauna,"" thought Kung. ",8556,8617
103,"Then he hummed the lines of a song to himself: ""Who once has seen the sea close by, All rivers shallow streams declares; ",8617,8738
104," Who o'er Wu's hill the clouds watched fly, Says nothing with that view compares."" ",8737,8820
105,The youth smiled. ,8820,8838
106,"""My little sister Giauna is still very young,"" said he. ",8838,8894
107,"""Besides, she is my father's only daughter, and he would not like to see her marry some one from afar. ",8894,8997
108,But my cousin A-Sung is not homely either. ,8997,9040
109,"If you do not believe me, wait until they go walking in the garden, and then you may take a look at them without their knowing it."" ",9040,9172
110,"Kung posted himself at the open window on the look-out, and sure enough, he saw Giauna come along leading another girl by the hand, a girl so beautiful that there was none other like her. ",9172,9360
111,"Giauna and she seemed to be sisters, only to be told apart by a slight difference in age. ",9360,9450
112,"Then young Kung was exceedingly happy and begged his friend to act for him in arranging the marriage, which the latter promised to do. ",9450,9585
113,"The next day he came to Kung, and told him amid congratulations that everything was arranged. ",9585,9679
114,"A special court was put in order for the young pair, and the wedding was celebrated. ",9679,9764
115,"Young Kung felt as though he had married a fairy, and the two became very fond of each other. ",9764,9858
116,"One day Kung's friend came to him in a state of great excitement and said: ""The owner of this house is coming back, and my father now wishes to return to Shensi. ",9858,10020
117,"The time for us to part draws near, and I am very sad!"" ",10020,10076
118,"Kung wished to accompany them, but his friend advised him to return to his own home. ",10076,10161
119,"Kung mentioned the difficulties in the way, but the youth replied: ""That need not worry you, because I will accompany you."" ",10161,10285
120,"After a time the father came, together with A-Sung, and made Kung a present of a hundred ounces of gold. ",10285,10390
121,"Then the youth took Kung and his wife by the hand, and told them to close their eyes. ",10390,10476
122,As soon as they did so off they went through the air like a storm-wind. ,10476,10548
123,All Kung could notice was that the gale roared about his ears. ,10548,10611
124,"When some time had passed the youth cried: ""Now we have arrived!"" ",10611,10677
125,"Kung opened his eyes and saw his old home, and then he knew that his friend was not of human kind. ",10677,10776
126,Gaily they knocked at the door of his home. ,10776,10820
127,His mother opened it and when she saw that he had brought along so charming a wife she was greatly pleased. ,10820,10928
128,"Then Kung turned around to his friend, but the latter had already disappeared. ",10928,11007
129,"A-Sung served her mother-in-law with great devotion, and her beauty and virtue was celebrated far and near. ",11007,11115
130,"Soon after young Kung gained the doctorate, and was appointed inspector of prisons in Shensi. ",11115,11209
131,"He took his wife along with him, but his mother remained at home, since Shensi was too far for her to travel. ",11209,11319
132,And heaven gave A-Sung and Kung a little son. ,11319,11365
133,But Kung became involved in a dispute with a traveling censor. ,11365,11428
134,The latter complained about Kung and he was dismissed from his post. ,11428,11497
135,"So it happened that one day he was idling about before the city, when he saw a handsome youth riding a black mule. ",11497,11612
136,When he looked more closely he saw that it was his old friend. ,11612,11675
137,"They fell into each others' arms, laughing and weeping, and the youth led him to a village. ",11675,11767
138,"In the midst of a thick grove of trees which threw a deep shade, stood a house whose upper stories rose to the skies. ",11767,11885
139,One could see at a glance that people of distinction lived there. ,11885,11951
140,"Kung now inquired after sister Giauna, and was told that she had married. ",11951,12025
141,He remained over night and then went off to fetch his wife. ,12025,12085
142,In the meantime Giauna arrived. ,12085,12117
143,"She took A-Sung's little son in her arms and said: ""Cousin, this is a little stranger in our family!"" ",12117,12219
144,"Kung greeted her, and again thanked her for the kindness she had shown him in curing his illness. ",12219,12317
145,"She answered with a smile: ""Since then you have become a distinguished man, and the wound has long since healed. ",12317,12430
146,"Have you still not forgotten your pain?"" ",12430,12471
147,"Then Giauna's husband arrived, and every one became acquainted. ",12471,12535
148,And after that they parted. ,12535,12563
149,"One day the youth came sadly to Kung and said: ""We are threatened by a great misfortune to-day. ",12563,12659
150,"I do not know whether you would be willing to save us!"" ",12659,12715
151,Kung did not know what it might be; ,12715,12751
152, but he gladly promised his aid. ,12750,12783
153,Then the youth called up the entire family and they bowed down in the outer court. ,12783,12866
154,"He began: ""I will tell you the truth just as it is. ",12866,12918
155,We are foxes. ,12918,12932
156,This day we are threatened by the danger of thunder. ,12932,12985
157,"If you care to save us, then there is a hope that we may manage to stay alive; ",12985,13064
158," if not, then take your child and go, so that you are not involved in our danger."" ",13063,13146
159,But Kung vowed that he would share life and death with them. ,13146,13207
160,"Then the youth begged him to stand in the door with a sword in his hand, and said: ""Now when the thunder begins to roll you must stand there and never stir."" ",13207,13365
161,"Suddenly dark clouds rose in the sky, and the heavens grew gloomy as if night were closing down. ",13365,13462
162,"Kung looked about him, but the buildings had all disappeared, and behind him he could only see a high barrow, in which was a large cave whose interior was lost in darkness. ",13462,13635
163,In the midst of his fright he was surprised by a thunderbolt. ,13635,13697
164,"A heavy rain poured down in streams, and a storm wind arose which rooted up the tallest trees. ",13697,13792
165,Everything glimmered before his eyes and his ears were deafened. ,13792,13857
166,"But he held his sword in his hand, and stood as firm as a rock. ",13857,13921
167,"Suddenly in the midst of black smoke and flashes of lightning, he saw a monster with a pointed beak and long claws, which was carrying off a human body. ",13921,14074
168,When he looked more closely he recognized by the dress that it was Giauna. ,14074,14149
169,"He leaped up at the monster and struck at him with his sword, and at once Giauna fell to the ground. ",14149,14250
170,"A tremendous crash of thunder shook the earth, and Kung fell down dead. ",14250,14322
171,"Then the tempest cleared away, and the blue sky appeared once more. ",14322,14390
172,"Giauna had regained consciousness, and when she saw Kung lying dead beside her she said amid sobs: ""He died for my sake! ",14390,14511
173,"Why should I continue to live?"" ",14511,14543
174,"A-Sung also came out, and together they carried him into the cave. ",14543,14610
175,Giauna told A-Sung to hold his head while her brother opened his mouth. ,14610,14682
176,"She herself took hold of his chin, and brought out her little red pellet. ",14682,14756
177,"She pressed it against his lips with her own, and breathed into his lungs. ",14756,14831
178,"Then the breath came back to his throat with a rattling noise, and in a short time he was himself once more. ",14831,14940
179,"So there was the whole family reunited again, and none of its members had come to harm. ",14940,15028
180,"They gradually recovered from their fright, and were quite happy: when suddenly a small boy brought the news that Giauna's husband and his whole family had been killed by the thunder. ",15028,15212
181,"Giauna broke down, weeping, and the others tried to comfort her. ",15212,15277
182,"Finally Kung said: ""It is not well to dwell too long amid the graves of the dead. ",15277,15359
183,"Will you not come home with me?"" ",15359,15392
184,Thereupon they packed up their belongings and went with him. ,15392,15453
185,"He assigned a deserted garden, which he carefully walled off, to his friend and his family as a dwelling-place. ",15453,15565
186,Only when Kung and A-Sung came to visit them was the bolt drawn. ,15565,15630
187,"Then Giauna and her brother played chess, drank tea and chatted with them like members of the same family. ",15630,15737
188,"But Kung's little son had a somewhat pointed face, which resembled a fox's, and when he went along the street, the people would turn around and say: ""There goes the fox-child!""",15737,15914
