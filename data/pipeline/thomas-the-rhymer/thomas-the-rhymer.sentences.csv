0,"Of all the young gallants in Scotland in the thirteenth century, there was none more gracious and debonair than Thomas Learmont, Laird of the Castle of Ercildoune, in Berwickshire. ",0,181
1,"He loved books, poetry, and music, which were uncommon tastes in those days; ",181,258
2," and, above all, he loved to study nature, and to watch the habits of the beasts and birds that made their abode in the fields and woods round about his home. ",257,416
3,"Now it chanced that, one sunny May morning, Thomas left his Tower of Ercildoune, and went wandering into the woods that lay about the Huntly Burn, a little stream that came rushing down from the slopes of the Eildon Hills. ",416,639
4,"It was a lovely morning--fresh, and bright, and warm, and everything was so beautiful that it looked as Paradise might look. ",639,764
5,"The tender leaves were bursting out of their sheaths, and covering all the trees with a fresh soft mantle of green; ",764,880
6," and amongst the carpet of moss under the young man's feet, yellow primroses and starry anemones were turning up their faces to the morning sky. ",879,1024
7,"The little birds were singing like to burst their throats, and hundreds of insects were flying backwards and forwards in the sunshine; ",1024,1159
8," while down by the burnside the bright-eyed water-rats were poking their noses out of their holes, as if they knew that summer had come, and wanted to have a share in all that was going on. ",1158,1348
9,"Thomas felt so happy with the gladness of it all, that he threw himself down at the root of a tree, to watch the living things around him. ",1348,1487
10,"As he was lying there, he heard the trampling of a horse's hooves, as it forced its way through the bushes; ",1487,1595
11," and, looking up, he saw the most beautiful lady that he had ever seen coming riding towards him on a grey palfrey. ",1594,1710
12,"She wore a hunting dress of glistening silk, the colour of the fresh spring grass; ",1710,1793
13," and from her shoulders hung a velvet mantle, which matched the riding-skirt exactly. ",1792,1878
14,"Her yellow hair, like rippling gold, hung loosely round her shoulders, and on her head sparkled a diadem of precious stones, which flashed like fire in the sunlight. ",1878,2044
15,"Her saddle was of pure ivory, and her saddle-cloth of blood-red satin, while her saddle girths were of corded silk and her stirrups of cut crystal. ",2044,2192
16,"Her horse's reins were of beaten gold, all hung with little silver bells, so that, as she rode along, she made a sound like fairy music. ",2192,2329
17,"Apparently she was bent on the chase, for she carried a hunting-horn and a sheaf of arrows; ",2329,2421
18," and she led seven greyhounds along in a leash, while as many scenting hounds ran loose at her horse's side. ",2420,2529
19,"As she rode down the glen, she lilted a bit of an old Scotch song; ",2529,2596
20," and she carried herself with such a queenly air, and her dress was so magnificent, that Thomas was like to kneel by the side of the path and worship her, for he thought that it must be the Blessed Virgin herself. ",2595,2809
21,"But when the rider came to where he was, and understood his thoughts, she shook her head sadly. ",2809,2905
22,"""I am not that Blessed Lady, as thou thinkest,"" she said. ",2905,2963
23,"""Men call me Queen, but it is of a far other country; ",2963,3017
24," for I am the Queen of Fairy-land, and not the Queen of Heaven."" ",3016,3081
25,And certainly it seemed as if what she said were true; ,3081,3136
26," for, from that moment, it was as if a spell were cast over Thomas, making him forget prudence, and caution, and common-sense itself. ",3135,3269
27,"For he knew that it was dangerous for mortals to meddle with Fairies, yet he was so entranced with the Lady's beauty that he begged her to give him a kiss. ",3269,3425
28,"This was just what she wanted, for she knew that if she once kissed him she had him in her power. ",3425,3523
29,"And, to the young man's horror, as soon as their lips had met, an awful change came over her. ",3523,3617
30,"For her beautiful mantle and riding-skirt of silk seemed to fade away, leaving her clad in a long grey garment, which was just the colour of ashes. ",3617,3765
31,"Her beauty seemed to fade away also, and she grew old and wan; ",3765,3828
32," and, worst of all, half of her abundant yellow hair went grey before his very eyes. ",3827,3912
33,"She saw the poor man's astonishment and terror, and she burst into a mocking laugh. ",3912,3996
34,"""I am not so fair to look on now as I was at first,"" she said, ""but that matters little, for thou hast sold thyself, Thomas, to be my servant for seven long years. ",3996,4160
35,"For whoso kisseth the Fairy Queen must e'en go with her to Fairy-land, and serve her there till that time is past."" ",4160,4276
36,When he heard these words poor Thomas fell on his knees and begged for mercy. ,4276,4354
37,But mercy he could not obtain. ,4354,4385
38,"The Elfin Queen only laughed in his face, and brought her dapple-grey palfrey close up to where he was standing. ",4385,4498
39,"""No, no,"" she said, in answer to his entreaties. ",4498,4547
40,"""Thou didst ask the kiss, and now thou must pay the price. ",4547,4606
41,"So dally no longer, but mount behind me, for it is full time that I was gone."" ",4606,4685
42,"So Thomas, with many a sigh and groan of terror, mounted behind her; ",4685,4754
43," and as soon as he had done so, she shook her bridle rein, and the grey steed galloped off. ",4753,4845
44,"On and on they went, going swifter than the wind; ",4845,4895
45," till they left the land of the living behind, and came to the edge of a great desert, which stretched before them, dry, and bare, and desolate, to the edge of the far horizon. ",4894,5071
46,"At least, so it seemed to the weary eyes of Thomas of Ercildoune, and he wondered if he and his strange companion had to cross this desert; ",5071,5211
47," and, if so, if there were any chance of reaching the other side of it alive. ",5210,5288
48,"But the Fairy Queen suddenly tightened her rein, and the grey palfrey stopped short in its wild career. ",5288,5392
49,"""Now must thou descend to earth, Thomas,"" said the Lady, glancing over her shoulder at her unhappy captive, ""and lout down, and lay thy head on my knee, and I will show thee hidden things, which cannot be seen by mortal eyes."" ",5392,5619
50,"So Thomas dismounted, and louted down, and rested his head on the Fairy Queen's knee; ",5619,5705
51," and lo, as he looked once more over the desert, everything seemed changed. ",5704,5780
52,"For he saw three roads leading across it now, which he had not noticed before, and each of these three roads was different. ",5780,5904
53,"One of them was broad, and level, and even, and it ran straight on across the sand, so that no one who was travelling by it could possibly lose his way. ",5904,6057
54,And the second road was as different from the first as it well could be. ,6057,6130
55,"It was narrow, and winding, and long; ",6130,6168
56," and there was a thorn hedge on one side of it, and a briar hedge on the other; ",6167,6247
57," and those hedges grew so high, and their branches were so wild and tangled, that those who were travelling along that road would have some difficulty in persevering on their journey at all. ",6246,6437
58,And the third road was unlike any of the others. ,6437,6486
59,"It was a bonnie, bonnie road, winding up a hillside among brackens, and heather, and golden-yellow whins, and it looked as if it would be pleasant travelling, to pass that way. ",6486,6663
60,"""Now,"" said the Fairy Queen, ""and thou wilt, I shall tell thee where these three roads lead to. ",6663,6759
61,"The first road, as thou seest, is broad, and even, and easy, and there be many that choose it to travel on. ",6759,6867
62,"But though it be a good road, it leadeth to a bad end, and the folk that choose it repent their choice for ever."" ",6867,6981
63,"""And as for the narrow road, all hampered and hindered by the thorns and the briars, there be few that be troubled to ask where that leadeth to. ",6981,7126
64,"But did they ask, perchance more of them might be stirred up to set out along it. ",7126,7208
65,For that is the Road of Righteousness; ,7208,7247
66," and, although it be hard and irksome, yet it endeth in a glorious City, which is called the City of the Great King."" ",7246,7364
67,"""And the third road--the bonnie road--that runs up the brae among the ferns, and leadeth no mortal kens whither, but I ken where it leadeth, Thomas--for it leadeth unto fair Elf-land; ",7364,7548
68," and that road take we."" ",7547,7572
69,"""And, mark'ee, Thomas, if ever thou hopest to see thine own Tower of Ercildoune again, take care of thy tongue when we reach our journey's end, and speak no single word to anyone save me--for the mortal who openeth his lips rashly in Fairy-land must bide there for ever."" ",7572,7844
70,"Then she bade him mount her palfrey again, and they rode on. ",7844,7905
71,"The ferny road was not so bonnie all the way as it had been at first, however. ",7905,7984
72,"For they had not ridden along it very far before it led them into a narrow ravine, which seemed to go right down under the earth, where there was no ray of light to guide them, and where the air was dank and heavy. ",7984,8199
73,"There was a sound of rushing water everywhere, and at last the grey palfrey plunged right into it; ",8199,8298
74," and it crept up, cold and chill, first over Thomas's feet, and then over his knees. ",8297,8382
75,"His courage had been slowly ebbing ever since he had been parted from the daylight, but now he gave himself up for lost; ",8382,8503
76, for it seemed to him certain that his strange companion and he would never come safe to their journey's end. ,8502,8612
77,He fell forward in a kind of swoon; ,8612,8648
78," and, if it had not been that he had tight hold of the Fairy's ash-grey gown, I warrant he had fallen from his seat, and had been drowned. ",8647,8786
79,"But all things, be they good or bad, pass in time, and at last the darkness began to lighten, and the light grew stronger, until they were back in broad sunshine. ",8786,8949
80,"Then Thomas took courage, and looked up; ",8949,8990
81," and lo, they were riding through a beautiful orchard, where apples and pears, dates and figs and wine-berries grew in great abundance. ",8989,9125
82,"And his tongue was so parched and dry, and he felt so faint, that he longed for some of the fruit to restore him. ",9125,9239
83,He stretched out his hand to pluck some of it; ,9239,9286
84, but his companion turned in her saddle and forbade him. ,9285,9342
85,"""There is nothing safe for thee to eat here,"" she said, ""save an apple, which I will give thee presently. ",9342,9448
86,"If thou touch aught else thou art bound to remain in Fairy-land for ever."" ",9448,9523
87,So poor Thomas had to restrain himself as best he could; ,9523,9580
88," and they rode slowly on, until they came to a tiny tree all covered with red apples. ",9579,9665
89,"The Fairy Queen bent down and plucked one, and handed it to her companion. ",9665,9740
90,"""This I can give thee,"" she said, ""and I do it gladly, for these apples are the Apples of Truth; ",9740,9837
91," and whoso eateth them gaineth this reward, that his lips will never more be able to frame a lie."" ",9836,9935
92,"Thomas took the apple, and ate it; ",9935,9970
93, and for evermore the Grace of Truth rested on his lips; ,9969,10026
94," and that is why, in after years, men called him ""True Thomas."" ",10025,10089
95,"They had only a little way to go after this, before they came in sight of a magnificent Castle standing on a hillside. ",10089,10208
96,"""Yonder is my abode,"" said the Queen, pointing to it proudly. ",10208,10270
97,"""There dwelleth my Lord and all the Nobles of his court; ",10270,10327
98," and, as my Lord hath an uncertain temper and shows no liking for any strange gallant whom he sees in my company, I pray thee, both for thy sake and mine, to utter no word to anyone who speaketh to thee; ",10326,10530
99," and, if anyone should ask me who and what thou art, I will tell them that thou art dumb. ",10529,10619
100,"So wilt thou pass unnoticed in the crowd."" ",10619,10662
101,"With these words the Lady raised her hunting-horn, and blew a loud and piercing blast; ",10662,10749
102," and, as she did so, a marvellous change came over her again; ",10748,10810
103," for her ugly ash-covered gown dropped off her, and the grey in her hair vanished, and she appeared once more in her green riding-skirt and mantle, and her face grew young and fair. ",10809,10991
104,And a wonderful change passed over Thomas also; ,10991,11039
105," for, as he chanced to glance downwards, he found that his rough country clothes had been transformed into a suit of fine brown cloth, and that on his feet he wore satin shoon. ",11038,11215
106,"Immediately the sound of the horn rang out, the doors of the Castle flew open, and the King hurried out to meet the Queen, accompanied by such a number of Knights and Ladies, Minstrels and Page-boys, that Thomas, who had slid from his palfrey, had no difficulty in obeying her wishes and passing into the Castle unobserved. ",11215,11539
107,"Everyone seemed very glad to see the Queen back again, and they crowded into the Great Hall in her train, and she spoke to them all graciously, and allowed them to kiss her hand. ",11539,11718
108,"Then she passed, with her husband, to a dais at the far end of the huge apartment, where two thrones stood, on which the Royal pair seated themselves to watch the revels which now began. ",11718,11905
109,"Poor Thomas, meanwhile, stood far away at the other end of the Hall, feeling very lonely, yet fascinated by the extraordinary scene on which he was gazing. ",11905,12061
110,"For, although all the fine Ladies, and Courtiers, and Knights were dancing in one part of the Hall, there were huntsmen coming and going in another part, carrying in great antlered deer, which apparently they had killed in the chase, and throwing them down in heaps on the floor. ",12061,12341
111,"And there were rows of cooks standing beside the dead animals, cutting them up into joints, and bearing away the joints to be cooked. ",12341,12475
112,"Altogether it was such a strange, fantastic scene that Thomas took no heed of how the time flew, but stood and gazed, and gazed, never speaking a word to anybody. ",12475,12638
113,"This went on for three long days, then the Queen rose from her throne, and, stepping from the dais, crossed the Hall to where he was standing. ",12638,12781
114,"""It is time to mount and ride, Thomas,"" she said, ""if thou wouldst ever see the fair Castle of Ercildoune again."" ",12781,12895
115,Thomas looked at her in amazement. ,12895,12930
116,"""Thou spokest of seven long years, Lady,"" he exclaimed, ""and I have been here but three days."" ",12930,13025
117,The Queen smiled. ,13025,13043
118,"""Time passeth quickly in Fairy-land, my friend,"" she replied. ",13043,13105
119,"""Thou thinkest that thou hast been here but three days. ",13105,13161
120,It is seven years since we two met. ,13161,13197
121,And now it is time for thee to go. ,13197,13232
122,"I would fain have had thy presence with me longer, but I dare not, for thine own sake. ",13232,13319
123,"For every seventh year an Evil Spirit cometh from the Regions of Darkness, and carrieth back with him one of our followers, whomsoever he chanceth to choose. ",13319,13477
124,"And, as thou art a goodly fellow, I fear that he might choose thee."" ",13477,13546
125,"""So, as I would be loth to let harm befall thee, I will take thee back to thine own country this very night."" ",13546,13656
126,"Once more the grey palfrey was brought, and Thomas and the Queen mounted it; ",13656,13733
127," and, as they had come, so they returned to the Eildon Tree near the Huntly Burn. ",13732,13814
128,Then the Queen bade Thomas farewell; ,13814,13851
129," and, as a parting gift, he asked her to give him something that would let people know that he had really been to Fairy-land. ",13850,13976
130,"""I have already given thee the Gift of Truth,"" she replied. ",13976,14036
131,"""I will now give thee the Gifts of Prophecy and Poesie; ",14036,14092
132," so that thou wilt be able to foretell the future, and also to write wondrous verses. ",14091,14177
133,"And, besides these unseen gifts, here is something that mortals can see with their own eyes--a Harp that was fashioned in Fairy-land. ",14177,14311
134,"Fare thee well, my friend. ",14311,14338
135,"Some day, perchance, I will return for thee again."" ",14338,14390
136,"With these words the Lady vanished, and Thomas was left alone, feeling a little sorry, if the truth must be told, at parting with such a radiant Being and coming back to the ordinary haunts of men. ",14390,14588
137,"After this he lived for many a long year in his Castle of Ercildoune, and the fame of his poetry and of his prophecies spread all over the country, so that people named him True Thomas, and Thomas the Rhymer. ",14588,14797
138,"I cannot write down for you all the prophecies which Thomas uttered, and which most surely came to pass, but I will tell you one or two. ",14797,14934
139,"He foretold the Battle of Bannockburn in these words: ""The Burn of Breid Shall rin fou reid,"" which came to pass on that terrible day when the waters of the little Bannockburn were reddened by the blood of the defeated English. ",14934,15162
140,"He also foretold the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, under a Prince who was the son of a French Queen, and who yet bore the blood of Bruce in his veins. ",15162,15328
141,"""A French Quen shall bearre the Sonne; ",15328,15367
142," Shall rule all Britainne to the sea, As neere as is the ninth degree,"" which thing came true in 1603, when King James, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, became Monarch of both countries. ",15366,15549
143,"Fourteen long years went by, and people were beginning to forget that Thomas the Rhymer had ever been in Fairy-land; ",15549,15666
144," but at last a day came when Scotland was at war with England, and the Scottish army was resting by the banks of the Tweed, not far from the Tower of Ercildoune. ",15665,15827
145,"And the Master of the Tower determined to make a feast, and invite all the Nobles and Barons who were leading the army to sup with him. ",15827,15963
146,That feast was long remembered. ,15963,15995
147,For the Laird of Ercildoune took care that everything was as magnificent as it could possibly be; ,15995,16093
148," and when the meal was ended he rose in his place, and, taking his Elfin Harp, he sang to his assembled guests song after song of the days of long ago. ",16092,16244
149,"The guests listened breathlessly, for they felt that they would never hear such wonderful music again. ",16244,16347
150,And so it fell out. ,16347,16367
151,"For that very night, after all the Nobles had gone back to their tents, a soldier on guard saw, in the moonlight, a snow-white Hart and Hind moving slowly down the road that ran past the camp. ",16367,16560
152,There was something so unusual about the animals that he called to his officer to come and look at them. ,16560,16665
153,"And the officer called to his brother officers, and soon there was quite a crowd softly following the dumb creatures, who paced solemnly on, as if they were keeping time to music unheard by mortal ears. ",16665,16868
154,"""There is something uncanny about this,"" said one soldier at last. ",16868,16935
155,"""Let us send for Thomas of Ercildoune, perchance he may be able to tell us if it be an omen or no."" ",16935,17035
156,"""Ay, send for Thomas of Ercildoune,"" cried every one at once. ",17035,17097
157,So a little page was sent in haste to the old Tower to rouse the Rhymer from his slumbers. ,17097,17188
158,"When he heard the boy's message, the Seer's face grew grave and wrapt. ",17188,17259
159,"""It is a summons,"" he said softly, ""a summons from the Queen of Fairy-land. ",17259,17335
160,"I have waited long for it, and it hath come at last."" ",17335,17389
161,"And when he went out, instead of joining the little company of waiting men, he walked straight up to the snow-white Hart and Hind. ",17389,17520
162,As soon as he reached them they paused for a moment as if to greet him. ,17520,17592
163,"Then all three moved slowly down a steep bank that sloped to the little river Leader, and disappeared in its foaming waters, for the stream was in full flood. ",17592,17751
164,"And, although a careful search was made, no trace of Thomas of Ercildoune was found; ",17751,17836
165," and to this day the country folk believe that the Hart and the Hind were messengers from the Elfin Queen, and that he went back to Fairy-land with them.",17835,17989
