0,"There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast, and supported themselves by fishing. ",0,96
1,"They had only one child, a son, who was their pride and joy, and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long, and never felt tired or discontented with their lot. ",96,270
2,"This son's name was Uraschimataro, which means in Japanese, 'Son of the island,' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman, minding neither wind nor weather. ",270,442
3,"Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro, and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents, 'If your son goes on being so rash, one day he will try his luck once too often, and the waves will end by swallowing him up.' ",442,744
4,"But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks, and as he was really very clever in managing a boat, the old people were very seldom anxious about him. ",744,897
5,"One beautiful bright morning, as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat, he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle. ",897,1033
6,"He was delighted with his prize, and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home, when suddenly the turtle found its voice, and tremblingly begged for its life. ",1033,1205
7,"'After all,' it said, 'what good can I do you? ",1205,1252
8,"I am so young and small, and I would so gladly live a little longer. ",1252,1321
9,"Be merciful and set me free, and I shall know how to prove my gratitude.' ",1321,1395
10,"Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured, and besides, he could never bear to say no, so he picked up the turtle, and put it back into the sea. ",1395,1538
11,"Years flew by, and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea. ",1538,1620
12,"But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks, there arose a fierce whirlwind, which shattered his boat to pieces, and she was sucked under by the waves. ",1620,1793
13,Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate. ,1793,1849
14,"But he was a powerful swimmer, and struggled hard to reach the shore. ",1849,1919
15,"Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him, and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said: 'I am the turtle whose life you once saved. ",1919,2068
16,I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude. ,2068,2114
17,"The land is still far distant, and without my help you would never get there. ",2114,2192
18,"Climb on my back, and I will take you where you will.' ",2192,2247
19,"Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice, and thankfully accepted his friend's help. ",2247,2336
20,"But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell, when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once, but go under the sea, and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there. ",2336,2536
21,"Uraschimataro agreed willingly, and in another moment they were deep, deep down, with fathoms of blue water above their heads. ",2536,2663
22,"Oh, how quickly they darted through the still, warm sea! ",2663,2720
23,"The young man held tight, and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel, but for three days they rushed on, till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace, shining with gold and silver, crystal and precious stones, and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls. ",2720,3050
24,"But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside, he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within, which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales. ",3050,3215
25,'Where have you brought me?' ,3215,3244
26,he asked his guide in a low voice. ,3244,3279
27,"'To the palace of Ringu, the house of the sea god, whose subjects we all are,' answered the turtle. ",3279,3379
28,"'I am the first waiting maid of his daughter, the lovely princess Otohime, whom you will shortly see.' ",3379,3482
29,"Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him, that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next. ",3482,3624
30,"But the turtle, who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him, went at once to make known his arrival. ",3624,3768
31,"And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him, and she begged him to stay with her, and in return promised that he should never grow old, neither should his beauty fade. ",3768,3954
32,'Is not that reward enough?' ,3954,3983
33,"she asked, smiling, looking all the while as fair as the sun itself. ",3983,4052
34,"And Uraschimataro said 'Yes,' and so he stayed there. ",4052,4106
35,For how long? ,4106,4120
36,That he only knew later. ,4120,4145
37,"His life passed by, and each hour seemed happier than the last, when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents. ",4145,4283
38,"He fought against it hard, knowing how it would grieve the princess, but it grew on him stronger and stronger, till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong. ",4283,4469
39,"Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home, and that he must see his parents once more. ",4469,4575
40,"The princess was almost frozen with horror, and implored him to stay with her, or something dreadful would be sure to happen. ",4575,4701
41,"'You will never come back, and we shall meet again no more,' she moaned bitterly. ",4701,4783
42,"But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated, 'Only this once will I leave you, and then will I return to your side for ever.' ",4783,4907
43,"Sadly the princess shook her head, but she answered slowly, 'One way there is to bring you safely back, but I fear you will never agree to the conditions of the bargain.' ",4907,5078
44,"'I will do anything that will bring me back to you,' exclaimed Uraschimataro, looking at her tenderly, but the princess was silent: she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more. ",5078,5282
45,"Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box, and gave it to Uraschimataro, praying him to keep it carefully, and above all things never to open it. ",5282,5431
46,"'If you can do this,' she said as she bade him farewell, 'your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore, and will carry you back to me.' ",5431,5572
47,"Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart, and swore solemnly to do her bidding. ",5572,5652
48,"He hid the box safely in his garments, seated himself on the back of the turtle, and vanished in the ocean path, waving his hand to the princess. ",5652,5798
49,"Three days and three nights they swam through the sea, and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home. ",5798,5933
50,"The turtle bade him farewell, and was gone in a moment. ",5933,5989
51,Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps. ,5989,6057
52,"He saw the smoke curling through the roof, and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted. ",6057,6156
53,"He heard the children shouting and calling, and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto, and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return. ",6156,6316
54,Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street. ,6316,6389
55,"After all, everything was changed. ",6389,6424
56,Neither men nor houses were those he once knew. ,6424,6472
57,Quickly he saw his old home; ,6472,6501
58," yes, it was still there, but it had a strange look. ",6500,6553
59,"Anxiously he knocked at the door, and asked the woman who opened it after his parents. ",6553,6640
60,"But she did not know their names, and could give him no news of them. ",6640,6710
61,"Still more disturbed, he rushed to the burying ground, the only place that could tell him what he wished to know. ",6710,6824
62,Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant. ,6824,6878
63,And he was right. ,6878,6896
64,"In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents, and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son, and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea. ",6896,7096
65,"And so he found that since he had deft his home, three hundred years had passed by. ",7096,7180
66,"Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street, hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old. ",7180,7323
67,"But when the man spoke, he knew he was not dreaming, though he felt as if he had lost his senses. ",7323,7421
68,In despair he bethought him of the box which was the gift of the princess. ,7421,7496
69,Perhaps after all this dreadful thing was not true. ,7496,7548
70,"He might be the victim of some enchanter's spell, and in his hand lay the counter-charm. ",7548,7637
71,"Almost unconsciously he opened it, and a purple vapour came pouring out. ",7637,7710
72,"He held the empty box in his hand, and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled, like the hand of an old, old man. ",7710,7863
73,"He ran to the brook, which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain. ",7863,7939
74,and saw himself reflected as in a mirror. ,7939,7981
75,It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him. ,7981,8034
76,"Wounded to death, he crept back through the village, and no man knew the old, old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before. ",8034,8196
77,"So he toiled wearily back, till he reached the shore, and here he sat sadly on a rock, and called loudly on the turtle. ",8196,8316
78,"But she never came back any more, but instead, death came soon, and set him free. ",8316,8398
79,"But before that happened, the people who saw him sitting lonely on the shore had heard his story, and when their children were restless they used to tell them of the good son who from love to his parents had given up for their sakes the splendour and wonders of the palace in the sea, and the most beautiful woman in the world besides.",8398,8734
