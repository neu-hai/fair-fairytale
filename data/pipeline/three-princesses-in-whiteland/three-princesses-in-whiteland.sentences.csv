0,"Once upon a time there was a fisherman, who lived near the king's castle, and caught fish for the king's table. ",0,112
1,"One day when he had gone fishing, he could not catch a thing. ",112,174
2,"Try as he might, no matter how he baited or flung, not the tiniest fish would bite; ",174,258
3," but when this had gone on for a while, a head rose from the water and said: ""If you will give me the first new thing that has come into your house, you shall catch fish a-plenty!"" ",257,438
4,"Then the man agreed quickly, for he could think of no new thing that might have come into the house. ",438,539
5,"So he caught fish all day long, and as many as he could wish for, as may well be imagined. ",539,630
6,"But when he got home, he found that heaven had sent him a little son, the first new thing to come into the house since he had made his promise. ",630,774
7,"And when he told his wife about it, she began to weep and wail, and pray to God because of the vow her husband had made. ",774,895
8,"And the woman's grief was reported at the castle, and when it came to the king's ears, and he learned the reason, he promised to take the boy and see if he could not save him. ",895,1071
9,"And so the king took him and brought him up as though he were his own son, until he was grown. ",1071,1166
10,"Then one day the boy asked whether he might not go out fishing with his father, he wanted to so very much, said he. ",1166,1282
11,The king would not hear of it; ,1282,1313
12," but at last he was given permission, so he went to his father, and everything went well all day long, until they came home in the evening. ",1312,1452
13,"Then the son found he had forgotten his handkerchief, and went down to the boat to get it. ",1452,1543
14,"But no sooner was he in the boat than it moved off with a rush, and no matter how hard the youth worked against it with the oars, it was all in vain. ",1543,1693
15,"The boat drove on and on, all night long, and at last he came to a white strand, far, far away. ",1693,1789
16,"He stepped ashore, and after he had gone a while he met an old man with a great, white beard. ",1789,1883
17,"""What is this country called?"" ",1883,1914
18,asked the youth. ,1914,1931
19,"""Whiteland,"" was the man's answer, and he asked the youth where he came from, and what he wanted, and the latter told him. ",1931,2054
20,"""If you keep right on along the shore,"" said the man, ""you will come to three princesses, buried in the earth so that only their heads show. ",2054,2195
21,Then the first will call you--and she is the oldest--and beg you very hard to come to her and help her; ,2195,2299
22, and the next will do the same; ,2298,2330
23, but you must go to neither of them; ,2329,2366
24," walk quickly past them, and act as though you neither saw nor heard them. ",2365,2440
25,"But go up to the third, and do what she asks of you, for then you will make your fortune."" ",2440,2531
26,"When the youth came to the first princess, she called out to him, and begged him most earnestly to come to her; ",2531,2643
27, but he went on as though he had not seen her. ,2642,2689
28,And he passed the next one in the same manner; ,2689,2736
29, but went over to the third. ,2735,2764
30,"""If you will do what I tell you to, you shall have whichever one of us you want,"" said she. ",2764,2856
31,"Yes, he would do what she wanted. ",2856,2890
32,So she told him that three trolls had wished them into the earth where they were; ,2890,2972
33, but that formerly they had dwelt in the castle he saw on the edge of the forest. ,2971,3053
34,"""Now you must go to the castle, and let the trolls whip you one night through for each one of us,"" said she, ""and if you can hold out, you will have delivered us."" ",3053,3217
35,"""Yes,"" said the youth, he could manage that. ",3217,3262
36,"""When you go in,"" added the princess, ""you will find two lions standing by the door; ",3262,3347
37," but if you pass directly between them, they will do you no harm. ",3346,3412
38,"Go on into a dark little room and lie down, and then the troll will come and beat you; ",3412,3499
39," but after that you must take the bottle that hangs on the wall, and anoint yourself where he has beaten you, and you will be whole again. ",3498,3637
40,"And take the sword that hangs beside the bottle, and kill the troll with it."" ",3637,3715
41,"He did as the princess had told him, passed between the lions as though he did not see them, and right into the little room, where he lay down. ",3715,3859
42,"The first night a troll with three heads and three whips came, and beat the youth badly; ",3859,3948
43," but he held out, and when the troll had finished, he took the bottle and anointed himself, grasped the sword and killed the troll. ",3947,4079
44,When he came out in the morning the princesses were out of the ground up to their waists. ,4079,4169
45,The next night it was the same; ,4169,4201
46," but the troll who came this time had six heads and six whips, and beat him worse than the first one. ",4200,4302
47,"But when he came out in the morning, the princesses were out of the ground up to their ankles. ",4302,4397
48,"The third night came a troll who had nine heads and nine whips, and he beat and whipped the youth so severely that at last he fainted. ",4397,4532
49,"Then the troll took him and flung him against the wall, and as he did so the bottle fell down, and its whole contents poured over the youth, and he was at once sound and whole again. ",4532,4715
50,"Then he did not delay, but grasped the sword, killed the troll, and when he came out in the morning, the princesses were entirely out of the ground. ",4715,4864
51,"So he chose the youngest of them to be his queen, and lived long with her in peace and happiness. ",4864,4962
52,"But at last he was minded to travel home, and see how his parents fared. ",4962,5035
53,This did not suit his queen; ,5035,5064
54," but since he wanted to go so badly, and finally was on the point of departure, she said to him: ""One thing you must promise me, that you will only do what your father tells you to do, but not what your mother tells you to do."" ",5063,5291
55,And this he promised. ,5291,5313
56,Then she gave him a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it. ,5313,5405
57,"So he wished himself home, and his parents could not get over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome he had become. ",5405,5529
58,"When he had been home a few days, his mother wanted him to go up to the castle and show the king what a man he had grown to be. ",5529,5657
59,"His father said: ""No, he had better not do that, for we will have to do without him in the meantime."" ",5657,5759
60,"But there was no help for it, the mother begged and pleaded until he went. ",5759,5834
61,When he got there he was more splendidly dressed and fitted out than the other king. ,5834,5919
62,"This did not suit the latter, and he said: ""You can see what my queen looks like, but I cannot see yours; ",5919,6025
63," and I do not believe yours is as beautiful as mine."" ",6024,6078
64,"""God grant she were standing here, then you would see soon enough!"" ",6078,6146
65,"said the young king, and there she stood that very minute. ",6146,6205
66,"But she was very sad, and said to him: ""Why did you not follow my advice and listen to your father? ",6205,6305
67,"Now I must go straight home, and you have used up both of your wishes."" ",6305,6377
68,"With that she bound a ring with her name on it in his hair, and wished herself home. ",6377,6462
69,"Then the young king grew very sad, and went about day in, day out, with no other thought than getting back to his queen. ",6462,6583
70,"""I must try and see whether I cannot find out where Whiteland is,"" thought he, and wandered forth into the wide world. ",6583,6702
71,After he had gone a while he came to a hill; ,6702,6747
72, and there he met one who was the lord of all the beasts of the forest--for they came when he blew his horn--and him the king asked where Whiteland was. ,6746,6899
73,"""That I do not know,"" said he, ""but I will ask my beasts."" ",6899,6958
74,"Then he called them up with his horn, and asked whether any of them knew where Whiteland might be; ",6958,7057
75, but none of them knew anything about it. ,7056,7098
76,Then the man gave him a pair of snowshoes. ,7098,7141
77,"""If you stand in them,"" said he, ""you will come to my brother, who lives a hundred miles further on. ",7141,7242
78,He is the lord of the birds of the air. ,7242,7282
79,Ask him. ,7282,7291
80,"When you have found him, turn the snowshoes around so that they point this way, and they will come back home of their own accord."" ",7291,7422
81,"When the king got there, he turned the snowshoes around, as the lord of the beasts had told him, and they ran home again. ",7422,7544
82,"He asked about Whiteland, and the man called up all the birds with his horn, and asked whether any of them knew where Whiteland might be. ",7544,7682
83,But none of them knew. ,7682,7705
84,Long after the rest an old eagle came along; ,7705,7750
85," and he had been out for some ten years, but did not know either. ",7749,7815
86,"""Well,"" said the man, ""I will lend you a pair of snowshoes. ",7815,7875
87,"When you stand in them you will come to my brother, who lives a hundred miles further on. ",7875,7965
88,He is the lord of all the fishes in the sea. ,7965,8010
89,Ask him. ,7282,7291
90,"But do not forget to turn the snowshoes around again."" ",8019,8074
91,"The king thanked him, stepped into the snowshoes, and when he came to the one who was lord of all the fishes in the sea, he turned them around, and they ran back like the others. ",8074,8253
92,There he once more asked about Whiteland. ,8253,8295
93,"The man called up his fishes with his horn, but none of them knew anything about it. ",8295,8380
94,"At last there came an old, old carp, whom he had called with his horn only at the cost of much trouble. ",8380,8484
95,"When he asked him, he said: ""Yes, I know it well, for I was cook there for fully ten years. ",8484,8576
96,"To-morrow I have to go back again, because our queen, whose king has not come home again, is going to marry some one else."" ",8576,8700
97,"""If such be the case,"" said the man, ""I'll give you a bit of advice. ",8700,8769
98,"Out there by the wall three brothers have been standing for the last hundred years, fighting with each other about a hat, a cloak and a pair of boots. ",8769,8920
99,"Any one who has these three things can make himself invisible, and wish himself away as far as ever he will. ",8920,9029
100,"You might say that you would test their possessions, and then decide their quarrel for them."" ",9029,9123
101,"Then the king thanked him, and did as he said. ",9123,9170
102,"""Why do you stand there fighting till the end of time?"" ",9170,9226
103,said he to the brothers. ,9226,9251
104,"""Let me test your possessions if I am to decide your quarrel."" ",9251,9314
105,That suited them; ,9314,9332
106," but when he had hat, cloak and boots, he told them: ""I will give you my decision the next time we meet!"" ",9331,9437
107,and with that he wished himself far away. ,9437,9479
108,While he was flying through the air he happened to meet the North Wind. ,9479,9551
109,"""And where are you going?"" ",9551,9578
110,asked the North Wind. ,9578,9600
111,"""To Whiteland,"" said the king, and then he told him what had happened to him. ",9600,9678
112,"""Well,"" said the North Wind, ""you are traveling a little quicker than I am; ",9678,9754
113, for I must sweep and blow out every corner. ,9753,9798
114,"But when you come to your journey's end, stand on the steps beside the door, and then I'll tt. ",9798,9893
115,"And when the prince who is to have the queen comes and looks out to see what it all means, I'll just take him along with me."" ",9893,10019
116,The king did as the North Wind told him. ,10019,10060
117,He stationed himself on the steps; ,10060,10095
118," and when the North Wind came roaring and rushing up, and laid hold of the castle walls till they fairly shook, the prince came out to see what it was all about. ",10094,10256
119,"But that very moment the king seized him by the collar, and threw him out, and the North Wind took him and carried him off. ",10256,10380
120,"When he had borne him away, the king went into the castle. ",10380,10439
121,"At first the queen did not recognize him, for he had grown thin and pale because he had wandered so long in his great distress; ",10439,10567
122," but when he showed her the ring, she grew glad at heart, and then they had a wedding which was such a wedding that the news of it spread far and wide.",10566,10718
