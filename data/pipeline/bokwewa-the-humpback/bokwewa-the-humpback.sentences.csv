0,Bokwewa and his brother lived in a far-off part of the country. ,0,64
1,"By such as had knowledge of them, Bokwewa, the elder, although deformed and feeble of person, was considered a manito, who had assumed the mortal shape; ",64,217
2," while his younger brother, Kwasynd, manly in appearance, active, and strong, partook of the nature of the present race of beings. ",216,347
3,"They lived off the path, in a wild, lonesome place, far retired from neighbors, and, undisturbed by cares, they passed their time, content and happy. ",347,497
4,The days glided by serenely as the river that flowed by their lodge. ,497,566
5,"Owing to his lack of strength, Bokwewa never engaged in the chase, but gave his attention entirely to the affairs of the lodge. ",566,694
6,"In the long winter evenings he passed the time in telling his brother stories of the giants, spirits, weendigoes, and fairies of the elder age, when they had the exclusive charge of the world. ",694,887
7,"He also at times taught his brother the manner in which game should be pursued, pointed out to him the ways of the different beasts and birds of the chase, and assigned the seasons at which they could be hunted with most success. ",887,1117
8,"For a while the brother was eager to learn, and keenly attended to his duties as the provider of the lodge; ",1117,1225
9," but at length he grew weary of their tranquil life, and began to have a desire to show himself among men. ",1224,1331
10,"He became restive in their retirement, and was seized with a longing to visit remote places. ",1331,1424
11,"One day, Kwasynd told his brother that he should leave him; ",1424,1484
12," that he wished to visit the habitations of men, and to procure a wife. ",1483,1555
13,Bokwewa objected; ,1555,1573
14," but his brother overruled all that he said, and in spite of every remonstrance, he departed on his travels. ",1572,1681
15,He traveled for a long time. ,1681,1710
16,At length he fell in with the footsteps of men. ,1710,1758
17,"They were moving by encampments, for he saw, at several spots, the poles where they had passed. ",1758,1854
18,It was winter; ,1854,1869
19," and coming to a place where one of their company had died, he found upon a scaffold, lying at length in the cold blue air, the body of a beautiful young woman. ",1868,2029
20,"""She shall be my wife!"" ",2029,2053
21,exclaimed Kwasynd. ,2053,2072
22,"He lifted her up, and bearing her in his arms, he returned to his brother. ",2072,2147
23,"""Brother,"" he said, ""can not you restore her to life? ",2147,2201
24,"Oh, do me that favor!"" ",2201,2224
25,He looked upon the beautiful female with a longing gaze; ,2224,2281
26, but she lay as cold and silent as when he had found her upon the scaffold. ,2280,2356
27,"""I will try,"" said Bokwewa. ",2356,2384
28,"These words had been scarcely breathed, when the young woman rose up, opened her eyes, and looked upon Bokwewa with a smile, as if she had known him before. ",2384,2541
29,To Kwasynd she paid no heed whatever; ,2541,2579
30," but presently Bokwewa, seeing how she lingered in her gaze upon himself, said to her, ""Sister, that is your husband,"" pointing to Kwasynd. ",2578,2718
31,"She listened to his voice, and crossing the lodge, she sat by Kwasynd, and they were man and wife. ",2718,2817
32,For a long time they all lived contentedly together. ,2817,2870
33,"Bokwewa was very kind to his brother, and sought to render his days happy. ",2870,2945
34,"He was ever within the lodge, seeking to have it in readiness against the return of Kwasynd from the hunt. ",2945,3052
35,"And by following his directions, which were those of one deeply skilled in the chase, Kwasynd always succeeded in returning with a good store of meat. ",3052,3203
36,But the charge of the two brothers was greatly lightened by the presence of the spirit-wife; ,3203,3296
37," for without labor of the hand, she ordered the lodge, and as she willed, every thing took its place, and was at once in proper array. ",3295,3430
38,"The wish of her heart seemed to control whatever she looked upon, and it obeyed her desire. ",3430,3522
39,"But it was still more to the surprise of her husband Kwasynd that she never partook of food, nor shared in any way the longings and appetites of a mortal creature. ",3522,3686
40,"She had never been seen arranging her hair, like other females, or at work upon her garments, and yet they were ever seemly, and without blemish or disorder. ",3686,3844
41,"Behold her at any hour, she was ever beautiful, and she seemed to need no ornament, nor nourishment, nor other aid, to give grace or strength to her looks. ",3844,4000
42,"Kwasynd, when the first wonder of her ways had passed, payed little heed to her discourse; ",4000,4091
43," he was engrossed with the hunt, and chose rather to be abroad, pursuing the wild game, or in the lodge, enjoying its savory spoil, than the society of his spirit-wife. ",4090,4259
44,"But Bokwewa watched closely every word that fell from her lips, and often forgot, like her, all mortal appetite and care of the body, in conferring with her, and noting what she had to say of spirits and fairies, of stars, and streams that never ceased to flow, and the delight of the happy hunting-grounds, and the groves of the blessed. ",4259,4598
45,"One day Kwasynd had gone out as usual, and Bokwewa was sitting in the lodge, on the opposite side to his brother's wife, when she suddenly exclaimed: ""I must leave you,"" as a tall young man, whose face was like the sun in its brightness, entered, and taking her by the hand he led her to the door. ",4598,4896
46,"She made no resistance, but turning as she left the lodge, she cast upon Bokwewa a smile of kind regard, and was at once, with her companion, gone from his view. ",4896,5058
47,He ran to the door and glanced about. ,5058,5096
48,He saw nothing; ,5096,5112
49," but looking far off in the sky, he thought that he could discover, at a great distance, a shining track, and the dim figures of two who were vanishing in heaven. ",5111,5274
50,"When his brother returned, Bokwewa related all to him exactly as it had happened. ",5274,5356
51,"The face of Kwasynd changed, and was dark as the night. ",5356,5412
52,For several days he would not taste food. ,5412,5454
53,"Sometimes he would fall to weeping for a long time, and now only it seemed that he remembered how gentle and beautiful had been the ways of her who was lost. ",5454,5612
54,At last he said that he would go in search of her. ,5612,5663
55,Bokwewa tried to dissuade him from it; ,5663,5702
56, but he would not be turned aside from his purpose. ,5701,5753
57,"""Since you are resolved,"" said Bokwewa, ""listen to my advice. ",5753,5815
58,You will have to go South. ,5815,5842
59,"It is a long distance to the present abiding-place of your wife, and there are so many charms and temptations by the way that I fear you will be led astray and forget your errand. ",5842,6022
60,"For the people whom you will see in the country through which you have to pass, do nothing but amuse themselves. ",6022,6135
61,"They are very idle, gay and effeminate, and I fear that they will lead you astray. ",6135,6218
62,Your path is beset with dangers. ,6218,6251
63,I will mention one or two things which you must be on your guard against. ,6251,6325
64,"""In the course of your journey you will come to a large grape-vine lying across your path. ",6325,6416
65,"You must not even taste its fruit, for it is poisonous. ",6416,6472
66,Step over it. ,6472,6486
67,It is a snake. ,6486,6501
68,"You will next come to something that looks like bear's fat, of which you are so fond. ",6501,6587
69,"Touch it not, or you will be overcome by the soft habits of the idle people. ",6587,6664
70,It is frog's eggs. ,6664,6683
71,"These are snares laid by the way for you."" ",6683,6726
72,"Kwasynd promised that he would observe the advice and bidding his brother farewell, he set out. ",6726,6822
73,After traveling a long time he came to the enchanted grape-vine. ,6822,6887
74,"It looked so tempting, with its swelling purple clusters, that he forgot his brother's warning, and tasted the fruit. ",6887,7005
75,He went on till he came to the frog's eggs. ,7005,7049
76,They so much resembled delicious bear's fat that Kwasynd tasted them. ,7049,7119
77,He still went on. ,7119,7137
78,At length he came to a wide plain. ,7137,7172
79,"As he emerged from the forest the sun was falling in the west, and it cast its scarlet and golden shades far over the country. ",7172,7299
80,"The air was perfectly calm, and the whole prospect had the air of an enchanted land. ",7299,7384
81,"Fruits and flowers, and delicate blossoms, lured the eye and delighted the senses. ",7384,7467
82,"At a distance he beheld a large village, swarming with people, and as he drew near he discovered women beating corn in silver mortars. ",7467,7602
83,"When they saw Kwasynd approaching, they cried out: ""Bokwewa's brother has come to see us."" ",7602,7693
84,"Throngs of men and women, in bright apparel, hurried out to meet him. ",7693,7763
85,"He was soon, having already yielded to temptation by the way, overcome by their fair looks and soft speeches, and he was not long afterward seen beating corn with the women, having entirely abandoned all further quest for his lost wife. ",7763,8000
86,"Meantime, Bokwewa, alone in the lodge, often musing upon the discourse of the spirit-wife, who was gone, waited patiently his brother's return. ",8000,8144
87,"After the lapse of several years, when no tidings could be had, he set out in search of him, and he arrived in safety among the soft and idle people of the South. ",8144,8307
88,"He met the same allurements by the way, and they gathered around him on his coming as they had around his brother Kwasynd; ",8307,8430
89, but Bokwewa was proof against their flattery. ,8429,8476
90,He only grieved in his heart that any should yield. ,8476,8528
91,"He shed tears of pity to see that his brother had laid aside the arms of a hunter, and that he was beating corn with the women, indifferent to the fate and the fortune of his lost wife. ",8528,8714
92,Bokwewa ascertained that his brother's wife had passed on to a country beyond. ,8714,8793
93,"After deliberating for a time, and spending several days in a severe fast, he set out in the direction where he saw that a light shone from the sky. ",8793,8942
94,"It was far off, but Bokwewa had a stout heart; ",8942,8989
95," and strong in the faith that he was now on the broad path toward the happy land, he pressed forward. ",8988,9090
96,For many days he traveled without encountering any thing unusual. ,9090,9156
97,"And now plains of vast extent, and rich in waving grass, began to pass before his eyes. ",9156,9244
98,"He saw many beautiful groves, and heard the songs of countless birds. ",9244,9314
99,At length he began to fail in strength for lack of food; ,9314,9371
100, when he suddenly reached a high ground. ,9370,9411
101,From this he caught the first glimpse of the other land. ,9411,9468
102,"But it appeared to be still far off, and all the country between, partly vailed in silvery mists, glittered with lakes and streams of water. ",9468,9609
103,"As he pressed on, Bokwewa came in sight of innumerable herds of stately deer, moose, and other animals which walked near his path, and they appeared to have no fear of man. ",9609,9782
104,"And now again as he wound about in his course, and faced the north once more, he beheld, coming toward him, an immense number of men, women, and children, pressing forward in the direction of the shining land. ",9782,9992
105,"In this vast throng Bokwewa beheld persons of every age, from the little infant, the sweet and lovely penaisee, or younger son, to the feeble, gray old man, stooping under the burden of his years. ",9992,10189
106,"All whom Bokwewa met, of every name and degree, were heavily laden with pipes, weapons, bows, arrows, kettles and other wares and implements. ",10189,10331
107,"One man stopped him, and complained of the weary load he was carrying. ",10331,10402
108,Another offered him a kettle; ,10402,10432
109, another his bow and arrows; ,10431,10460
110," but he declined all, and, free of foot, hastened on. ",10459,10513
111,"And now he met women who were carrying their basket-work, and painted paddles, and little boys, with their embellished war-clubs and bows and arrows, the gift of their friends. ",10513,10690
112,"With this mighty throng, Bokwewa was borne along for two days and nights, when he arrived at a country so still and shining, and so beautiful in its woods and groves and plains, that he knew it was here that he should find the lost spirit-wife. ",10690,10935
113,"He had scarcely entered this fair country, with a sense of home and the return to things familiar strong upon him, when there appeared before him the lost spirit-wife herself, who, taking him by the hand, gave him welcome, saying, ""My brother, I am glad to see you. ",10935,11201
114,Welcome! ,11201,11210
115,welcome! ,11210,11219
116,"You are now in your native land!""",11219,11253
