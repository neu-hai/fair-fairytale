0,"Once upon a time there was a king, who had a queen that he loved with a great love. ",0,84
1,"But after a time the queen died, and all he had left was an only daughter. ",84,159
2,"And now that the king was a widower, his whole heart went out to the little princess. ",159,245
3,He cherished her as the apple of his eye. ,245,287
4,And the king's young daughter grew up into the most lovely maiden ever known. ,287,365
5,"When the princess had seen the snows of fifteen winters, it happened that a great war broke out. ",365,462
6,Her father had to march against the foe. ,462,503
7,But there was no one to whom the king could entrust his daughter while he was away at war. ,503,594
8,"So he had a great tower built out in the forest, provided it with a plentiful store of supplies. ",594,691
9,In it he shut up his daughter and a maid. ,691,733
10,"And he had it proclaimed that every man, no matter who he might be, was forbidden to approach the tower in which he had placed his daughter and the maid, under pain of death. ",733,908
11,"Now the king thought he had taken every precaution to protect his daughter, and went off to war. ",908,1005
12,In the meantime the princess and her maid sat in the tower. ,1005,1065
13,"But in the city there were a number of brave young sons of kings, as well as other young men, who would have liked to have talked to the beautiful maiden. ",1065,1220
14,"And when they found that this was forbidden them, they conceived a great hatred for the king. ",1220,1314
15,At length they took counsel with an old woman who was wiser than most folk. ,1314,1390
16,"They told her to arrange matters in such wise that the king's daughter and her maid might come into disrepute, without their having anything to do with it. ",1390,1546
17,"The old hag promised to help them, enchanted some apples, laid them in a basket, and went to the lonely tower in which the maidens lived. ",1546,1684
18,"When the king's daughter and her maid saw the old woman, who was sitting beneath the window, they felt a great longing to try the beautiful apples. ",1684,1832
19,So they called out and asked how much she wanted for her precious apples. ,1832,1906
20,The old woman said they were not for sale. ,1906,1949
21,"Yet as the girls kept on pleading with her, the old woman said she would make each of them a present of an apple. ",1949,2063
22,They only need let down a little basket from the tower. ,2063,2119
23,"The princess and her maid, in all innocence, did as the troll-woman told them, and each received an apple. ",2119,2226
24,"But the enchanted fruit had a strange effect, for in due course of time heaven sent them each a child. ",2226,2329
25,"The king's daughter called her son Silverwhite, and the son of her maid received the name of Lillwacker. ",2329,2434
26,"The two boys grew up larger and stronger than other children, and were very handsome as well. ",2434,2528
27,They looked as much alike as one cherry-pit does to another. ,2528,2589
28,One could easily see that they were related. ,2589,2634
29,"Seven years had passed, and the king was expected home from the war. ",2634,2703
30,"Then both girls were terrified, and they took counsel together as to how they might hide their children. ",2703,2808
31,"When at length they could find no other way out of the difficulty, they very sorrowfully bade their children farewell. ",2808,2927
32,"They let them down from the tower at night, to seek their fortune in the wide, wide world. ",2927,3018
33,At parting the king's daughter gave Silverwhite a costly knife. ,3018,3082
34,The maid had nothing to give her son. ,3082,3120
35,The two foster-brethren now wandered out into the world. ,3120,3177
36,"After they had gone a while, they came to a dark forest. ",3177,3234
37,"And in this forest they met a man, strange-looking and very tall. ",3234,3300
38,"He wore two swords at his side, and was accompanied by six great dogs. ",3300,3371
39,"He gave them a friendly greeting: ""Good-day, little fellows, from where do you come and to where do you go?"" ",3371,3480
40,"The boys told him they came from a high tower, and were going out into the world to seek their fortune. ",3480,3584
41,"The man replied: ""If such be the case, I know more about your origin than any one else. ",3584,3672
42,"And that you may have something by which to remember your father, I will give each of you a sword and three dogs. ",3672,3786
43,"But you must promise me one thing, that you will never part from your dogs; ",3786,3862
44," but take them with you wherever you go."" ",3861,3903
45,"The boys thanked the man for his kind gifts, and promised to do as he had told them. ",3903,3988
46,Then they bade him farewell and went their way. ,3988,4036
47,When they had traveled for some time they reached a cross-road. ,4036,4100
48,"Then Silverwhite said: ""It seems to me that it would be the best for us to try our luck singly, so let us part."" ",4100,4213
49,"Lillwacker answered: ""Your advice is good, but how am I to know whether or not you are doing well out in the world?"" ",4213,4330
50,"""I will give you a token by which you may tell,"" said Silverwhite, ""so long as the water runs clear in this spring you will know that I am alive. ",4330,4476
51,"If it turns red and roiled, it will mean that I am dead."" ",4476,4534
52,"Silverwhite then drew runes in the water of the spring, said farewell to his brother, and each of them went on alone. ",4534,4652
53,"Lillwacker soon came to a king's court, and took service there, but every morning he would go to the spring to see how his brother fared. ",4652,4790
54,"Silverwhite continued to wander over hill and dale, until he reached a great city. ",4790,4873
55,"But the whole city was in mourning, the houses were hung in black, and all the inhabitants went about full of grief and care, as though some great misfortune had occurred. ",4873,5045
56,Silverwhite went though the city and inquired as to the cause of all the unhappiness he saw. ,5045,5138
57,"They answered: ""You must have come from far away, since you do not know that the king and queen were in danger of being drowned at sea. ",5138,5274
58,He had to promise to give up their three daughters in order to escape. ,5274,5345
59,"To-morrow morning the sea-troll is coming to carry off the oldest princess."" ",5345,5422
60,"This news pleased Silverwhite, for he saw a fine opportunity to wealth and fame, should fortune favor him. ",5422,5529
61,"The next morning Silverwhite hung his sword at his side, called his dogs to him, and wandered down to the sea-shore alone. ",5529,5652
62,And as he sat on the strand he saw the king's daughter led out of the city. ,5652,5728
63,"With her went a courtier, who had promised to rescue her. ",5728,5786
64,But the princess was very sad and cried bitterly. ,5786,5836
65,Then Silverwhite stepped up to her with a polite greeting. ,5836,5895
66,"When the king's daughter and her escort saw the fearless youth, they were much frightened, because they thought he was the sea-troll. ",5895,6029
67,The courtier was so alarmed that he ran away and took refuge in a tree. ,6029,6101
68,"When Silverwhite saw how frightened the princess was, he said: ""Lovely maiden, do not fear me, for I will do you no harm."" ",6101,6224
69,"The king's daughter answered: ""Are you the troll who is coming to carry me away?"" ",6224,6306
70,"""No,"" said Silverwhite, ""I have come to rescue you."" ",6306,6359
71,"Then the princess was glad to think that such a brave hero was going to defend her, and they had a long, friendly talk. ",6359,6479
72,At the same time Silverwhite begged the king's daughter to comb his hair. ,6479,6553
73,"She complied with his request, and Silverwhite laid his head in her lap. ",6553,6626
74,"When he did so the princess drew a golden ring from her finger and, unbeknown to him, wound it into his locks. ",6626,6737
75,"Suddenly the sea-troll rose from the deeps, setting the waves whirling and foaming far and near. ",6737,6834
76,"When the troll saw Silverwhite, he grew angry and said: ""Why do you sit there beside my princess?"" ",6834,6933
77,"The youth replied: ""It seems to me that she is my princess, not yours."" ",6933,7005
78,"The sea-troll answered: ""Time enough to see which of us is right; ",7005,7071
79," but first our dogs shall fight."" ",7070,7104
80,"Silverwhite was nothing loath, and set his dogs at the dogs of the troll. ",7104,7178
81,There was a fierce struggle. ,7178,7207
82,But at last the youth's dogs got the upper hand and bit the dogs of the sea-troll to death. ,7207,7299
83,"Then Silverwhite drew his sword with a great sweep, rushed upon the sea-troll, and gave him such a tremendous blow that the monster's head rolled on the sand. ",7299,7458
84,"The troll gave a fearsome cry, and flung himself back into the sea, so that the water spurted to the very skies. ",7458,7571
85,"Thereupon the youth drew out his silver-mounted knife, cut out the troll's eyes and put them in his pocket. ",7571,7679
86,Then he saluted the lovely princess and went away. ,7679,7730
87,"Now when the battle was over and the youth had disappeared, the courtier crawled down from his tree, and threatened to kill the princess if she did not say before all the people that he, and none other, had rescued her. ",7730,7950
88,"The king's daughter did not dare refuse, since she feared for her life. ",7950,8022
89,"So she returned to her father's castle with the courtier, where they were received with great distinction. ",8022,8129
90,And joy reigned throughout the land when the news spread that the oldest princess had been rescued from the troll. ,8129,8244
91,On the following day everything repeated itself. ,8244,8293
92,"Silverwhite went down to the strand and met the second princess, just as she was to be delivered to the troll. ",8293,8404
93,"And when the king's daughter and her escort saw him, they were very much frightened, thinking he was the sea-troll. ",8404,8520
94,"And the courtier climbed a tree, just as he had before. ",8520,8576
95,"The princess granted the youth's petition, combed his hair as her sister had done, and also wound her gold ring into his long curls. ",8576,8709
96,"After a time there was a great tumult out at sea, and a sea-troll rose from the waves. ",8709,8796
97,He had three heads and three dogs. ,8796,8831
98,"But Silverwhite's dogs overcame those of the troll, and the youth killed the troll himself with his sword. ",8831,8938
99,"Thereupon he took out his silver-mounted knife, cut out the troll's eyes, and went his way. ",8938,9030
100,But the courtier lost no time. ,9030,9061
101,"He climbed down from his tree and forced the princess to promise to say that he, and none other, had rescued her. ",9061,9175
102,"Then they returned to the castle, where the courtier was acclaimed as the greatest of heroes. ",9175,9269
103,"On the third day Silverwhite hung his sword at his side, called his three dogs to him, and again wandered down to the sea-shore. ",9269,9398
104,"As he was sitting by the strand, he saw the youngest princess led out of the city, and with her the daring courtier who claimed to have rescued her sisters. ",9398,9555
105,But the princess was very sad and cried bitterly. ,5786,5836
106,Then Silverwhite stepped up and greeted the lovely maiden politely. ,9605,9673
107,"Now when the king's daughter and her escort saw the handsome youth, they were very much frightened, for they believed him to be the sea-troll. ",9673,9816
108,The courtier ran away and hid in a high tree that grew near the strand. ,9816,9888
109,"When Silverwhite noticed the maiden's terror, he said: ""Lovely maiden, do not fear me, for I will do you no harm."" ",9888,10003
110,"The king's daughter answered: ""Are you the troll who is coming to carry me away?"" ",6224,6306
111,"""No,"" said Silverwhite, ""I have come to rescue you."" ",6306,6359
112,"Then the princess was very glad to have such a brave hero fight for her, and they had a long, friendly talk with each other. ",10138,10263
113,At the same time Silverwhite begged the lovely maiden to do him a favor and comb his hair. ,10263,10354
114,"This the king's daughter was most willing to do, and Silverwhite laid his head in her lap. ",10354,10445
115,"But when the princess saw the gold rings her sisters had wound in his locks, she was much surprised, and added her own to the others. ",10445,10579
116,"Suddenly the sea-troll came shooting up out of the deep with a terrific noise, so that waves and foam spurted to the very skies. ",10579,10708
117,This time the monster had six heads and nine dogs. ,10708,10759
118,"When the troll saw Silverwhite sitting with the king's daughter, he fell into a rage and cried: ""What are you doing with my princess?"" ",10759,10894
119,"The youth answered: ""It seems to me that she is my princess rather than yours."" ",10894,10974
120,"Thereupon the troll said: ""Time enough to see which of us is right; ",10974,11042
121," but first our dogs shall fight each other."" ",11041,11086
122,"Silverwhite did not delay, but set his dogs at the sea-dogs, and they had a battle royal. ",11086,11176
123,But in the end the youth's dogs got the upper hand and bit all nine of the sea-dogs to death. ,11176,11270
124,"Finally Silverwhite drew out his bare sword, flung himself upon the sea-troll, and stretched all six of his heads on the sand with a single blow. ",11270,11416
125,"The monster uttered a terrible cry, and rushed back into the sea so that the water spurted to the heavens. ",11416,11523
126,"Then the youth drew his silver-mounted knife, cut out all twelve of the troll's eyes, saluted the king's young daughter, and hastily went away. ",11523,11667
127,"Now that the battle was over, and the youth had disappeared, the courtier climbed down from his tree, drew his sword and threatened to kill the princess unless she promised to say that he had rescued her from the troll, as he had her sisters. ",11667,11910
128,"The king's daughter did not dare refuse, since she feared for her life. ",7950,8022
129,"So they went back to the castle together, and when the king saw that they had returned in safety, without so much as a scratch, he and the whole court were full of joy, and they were accorded great honors. ",11982,12188
130,And at court the courtier was quite another fellow from the one who had hid away in the tree. ,12188,12282
131,"The king had a splendid banquet prepared, with amusements and games, and the sound of string music and dancing. ",12282,12394
132,He bestowed the hand of his youngest daughter on the courtier in reward for his bravey. ,12394,12482
133,"In the midst of the wedding festivities, when the king and his whole court were seated at table, the door opened, and in came Silverwhite with his dogs. ",12482,12635
134,The youth stepped boldly into the hall of state and greeted the king. ,12635,12705
135,"And when the three princesses saw who it was, they were full of joy, leaped up from their places, and ran over to him, much to the king's surprise, who asked what it all meant. ",12705,12882
136,"Then the youngest princess told him all that had happened, from beginning to end, and that Silverwhite had rescued them, while the courtier sat in a tree. ",12882,13037
137,"To prove it beyond any chance of doubt, each of the king's daughters showed her father the ring she had wound in Silverwhite's locks. ",13037,13171
138,"But the king still did not know quite what to think of it all, until Silverwhite said: ""My lord king! ",13171,13273
139,"In order that you need not doubt what your daughters have told you, I will show you the eyes of the sea-trolls whom I slew."" ",13273,13398
140,Then the king and all the rest saw that the princesses had told the truth. ,13398,13473
141,The traitorous courtier received his just punishment. ,13473,13527
142,"Silverwhite was paid every honor, and was given the youngest daughter and half of the kingdom with her. ",13527,13631
143,"One night, when all were sleeping, it chanced that he heard a knocking at the window, and a voice which said: ""Come, Silverwhite, I have to talk to you!"" ",13631,13785
144,"The king, who did not want to wake his young wife, rose hastily, girded on his sword, called his dogs and went out. ",13785,13901
145,"When he reached the open air, there stood a huge and savage-looking troll. ",13901,13976
146,"The troll said: ""Silverwhite, you have slain my three brothers, and I have come to bid you go down to the sea-shore with me, that we may fight with one another."" ",13976,14138
147,"This proposal suited the youth, and he followed the troll without protest. ",14138,14213
148,"When they reached the sea-shore, there lay three great dogs belonging to the troll. ",14213,14297
149,Silverwhite at once set his dogs at the troll-dogs. ,14297,14349
150,After a hard struggle the latter had to give in. ,14349,14398
151,"The young king drew his sword, bravely attacked the troll and dealt him many a mighty blow. ",14398,14490
152,It was a tremendous battle. ,14490,14518
153,"But when the troll noticed he was getting the worst of it, he grew frightened, quickly ran to a high tree, and clambered into it. ",14518,14648
154,"Silverwhite and the dogs ran after him, the dogs barking as loudly as they could. ",14648,14730
155,"Then the troll begged for his life and said: ""Dear Silverwhite, I will take wergild for my brothers, only bid your dogs be still, so that we may talk."" ",14730,14882
156,"The king bade his dogs be still, but in vain, they only barked the more loudly. ",14882,14962
157,"Then the troll tore three hairs from his head, handed them to Silverwhite and said: ""Lay a hair on each of the dogs, and then they will be as quiet as can be."" ",14962,15122
158,"The king did so and at once the dogs fell silent, and lay motionless as though they had grown fast to the ground. ",15122,15236
159,Now Silverwhite realized that he had been deceived; ,15236,15288
160, but it was too late. ,15287,15309
161,"The troll was already descending from the tree, and he drew his sword and again began to fight. ",15309,15405
162,"But they had exchanged no more than a few blows, before Silverwhite received a mortal wound, and lay on the earth in a pool of blood. ",15405,15539
163,But now we must tell about Lillwacker. ,15539,15578
164,The next morning he went to the spring by the cross-road and found it red with blood. ,15578,15664
165,Then he knew that Silverwhite was dead. ,15664,15704
166,"He called his dogs, hung his sword at his side, and went on until he came to a great city. ",15704,15795
167,"And the city was in festal array, the streets were crowded with people, and the houses were hung with scarlet cloths and splendid rugs. ",15795,15931
168,"Lillwacker asked why everybody was so happy, and they said: ""You must hail from distant parts, since you do not know that a famous hero has come here by the name of Silverwhite. ",15931,16109
169,"He has rescued our three princesses, and is now the king's son-in-law."" ",16109,16181
170,"Lillwacker then inquired how it had all come about, and then went his way, reaching the royal castle in which Silverwhite dwelt with his beautiful queen in the evening. ",16181,16350
171,"When Lillwacker entered the castle gate, all greeted him as though he had been the king. ",16350,16439
172,For he resembled his foster-brother so closely that none could tell one from the other. ,16439,16527
173,"When the youth came to the queen's room, she also took him for Silverwhite. ",16527,16603
174,"She went up to him and said: ""My lord king, where have you been so long? ",16603,16676
175,"I have been awaiting you with great anxiety."" ",16676,16722
176,"Lillwacker said little, and was very taciturn. ",16722,16769
177,Then he lay down on a couch in a corner of the queen's room. ,16769,16830
178,The young woman did not know what to think of his actions. ,16830,16889
179,Her husband did not act queerly at other times. ,16889,16937
180,"But she thought: ""One should not try to discover the secrets of others,"" and said nothing. ",16937,17028
181,"In the night, when all were sleeping, there was a knocking at the window, and a voice cried: ""Come, Lillwacker, I have to talk to you!"" ",17028,17164
182,"The youth rose hastily, took his good sword, called his dogs and went. ",17164,17235
183,"When he reached the open air, there stood the same troll who had slain Silverwhite. ",17235,17319
184,"He said: ""Come with me, Lillwacker, and then you shall see your foster-brother!"" ",17319,17400
185,"To this Lillwacker at once agreed, and the troll led the way. ",17400,17462
186,"When they came to the sea-shore, there lay the three great dogs whom the troll had brought with him. ",17462,17563
187,"Somewhat further away, where they had fought, lay Silverwhite in a pool of blood, and beside him his dogs were stretched out on the ground as though they had taken root in it. ",17563,17739
188,"Then Lillwacker saw how everything had happened, and thought that he would gladly venture his life, if he might in some way call his brother back from the dead. ",17739,17900
189,"He at once set his dogs at the troll-dogs, and they had a hard struggle, in which Lillwacker's dogs won the victory. ",17900,18017
190,"Then the youth drew his sword, and attacked the troll with mighty blows. ",18017,18090
191,"But when the troll saw that he was getting the worst of it, he took refuge in a lofty tree. ",18090,18182
192,Lillwacker and his dogs ran after him and the dogs barked loudly. ,18182,18248
193,"Then the troll humbly begged for his life, and said: ""Dear Lillwacker, I will give you wergild for your brother, only bid your dogs be still, so that we may talk."" ",18248,18412
194,"At the same time the troll handed him three hairs from his head and added: ""Lay one of these hairs on each of your dogs, and then they will soon be quiet."" ",18412,18568
195,"But Lillwacker saw through his cunning scheme, took the three hairs and laid them on the troll-dogs, which at once fell on the ground and lay like dead. ",18568,18721
196,"When the troll saw that his attempt had failed, he was much alarmed and said: ""Dearest Lillwacker, I will give you wergild for your brother, if you will only leave me alone."" ",18721,18896
197,"But the youth answered: ""What is there you can give me that will compensate for my brother's life?"" ",18896,18996
198,"The troll replied: ""Here are two flasks. ",18996,19037
199,"In one is a liquid which, if you anoint a dead man with it, it will restore him to life. ",19037,19126
200,"As to the liquid in the other flask, if you moisten anything with it, and some one touches the place you have moistened, he will be unable to move from the spot. ",19126,19288
201,"I think it would be hard to find anything more precious than the liquid in these flasks."" ",19288,19378
202,"Lillwacker said: ""Your proposal suits me, and I will accept it. ",19378,19442
203,"But there is something else you must promise to do: that you will release my brother's dogs."" ",19442,19536
204,"The troll agreed, climbed down from the tree, breathed on the dogs and thus freed them. ",19536,19624
205,Then Lillwacker took the two flasks and went away from the sea-shore with the troll. ,19624,19709
206,"After they had gone a while they came to a great flat stone, lying near the highway. ",19709,19794
207,Lillwacker hastened on in advance and moistened it with liquid from the second flask. ,19794,19880
208,"Then, as he was going by, Lillwacker suddenly set all six of his dogs at the troll, who stepped back and touched the stone. ",19880,20004
209,"There he stuck, and could move neither forward nor backward. ",20004,20065
210,After a time the sun rose and shone on the stone. ,20065,20115
211,And when the troll saw the sun he burst--and was as dead as a doornail! ,20115,20187
212,"Lillwacker now ran back to his brother and sprinkled him with the liquid in the other flask, so that he came to life again, and they were both very happy, as may well be imagined. ",20187,20367
213,"The two foster-brothers then returned to the castle, recounting the story of their experiences and adventures on the way. ",20367,20489
214,Lillwacker told how he had been taken for his brother. ,20489,20544
215,"He even mentioned that he had lain down on a couch in a corner of the queen's room, and that she had never suspected that he was not her rightful husband. ",20544,20699
216,"But when Silverwhite heard that, he thought that Lillwacker had offended against the queen's dignity, and he grew angry and fell into such a rage that he drew his sword, and thrust it into his brother's breast. ",20699,20910
217,"Lillwacker fell to earth dead, and Silverwhite went home to the castle alone. ",20910,20988
218,"But Lillwacker's dogs would not leave their master, and lay around him, whining and licking his wound. ",20988,21091
219,"In the evening, when the young king and his wife retired, the queen asked him why he had been so taciturn and serious the evening before. ",21091,21229
220,"Then the queen said: ""I am very curious to know what has befallen you during the last few days, but what I would like to know most of all, is why you lay down on a couch in a corner of my room the other night?"" ",21229,21440
221,"Now it was clear to Silverwhite that the brother he had slain was innocent of all offense, and he felt bitter regret at having repaid his faithfulness so badly. ",21440,21601
222,So King Silverwhite at once rose and went to the place where his brother was lying. ,21601,21685
223,He poured the water of life from his flask and anointed his brother's wound. ,21685,21762
224,"In a moment Lillwacker was alive again, and the two brother's went joyfully back to the castle. ",21762,21858
225,"When they got there, Silverwhite told his queen how Lillwacker had rescued him from death, and all the rest of their adventures, and all were happy at the royal court. ",21858,22026
226,They paid the youth the greatest honors and compliments. ,22026,22083
227,After he had stayed there a time he sued for the hand of the second princess and obtained it. ,22083,22177
228,"Thereupon the wedding was celebrated with great pomp, and Silverwhite divided his half of the kingdom with his foster-brother. ",22177,22304
229,"The two brothers continued to live together in peace and unity, and if they have not died, they are living still.",22304,22418
