0,"There was once a king, called King O'Toole, who was a fine old king in the old ancient times, long ago. ",0,104
1,It was him that owned the Churches in the early days. ,104,158
2,"""Surely,"" said I, ""the Churches were not in King O'Toole's time?"" ",158,224
3,"""Oh, by no means, your honor--truth, it's yourself that's right enough there. ",224,302
4,"But you know the place is called 'The Churches' because they were built after by St. Kavin, and went by the name of the Churches ever more. ",302,442
5,"Therefore, of course, the place bein' so called, I say that the King owned the Churches--and why not, sir, seein' it was his birthright, time out o' mind, beyond the flood? ",442,615
6,"Well, the King (you see) was the right sort--he was the real boy, and loved sport as he loved his life, and huntin' in particular. ",615,746
7,"From the risin' o' the sun up he got, and away he went over the mountains beyond after the deer: and the fine times them were. ",746,873
8,"The deer was as plenty thin, aye truth, far more plentiful than the sheep is now. ",873,955
9,"That's the way it was with the King, from the crow o' the cock to the song o' the redbreast."" ",955,1049
10,"Well, it was all mighty good as long as the King had his health. ",1049,1114
11,"But, you see, in coorse o' time, the King grew old, by reason he was stiff in his limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart failed him. ",1114,1260
12,"He was lost entirely for want o' diversions, because he couldn't go a huntin' no longer. ",1260,1349
13,"By dad, the poor King was obliged at last for to get a goose to distract him. ",1349,1427
14,"You see, the goose used for to swim across the lake, and go down divin' for trout (and not finer trout in all Ireland than the same trout) and catch fish on a Friday for the King. ",1427,1607
15,If flew every other day round about the lake disctracting the poor King that you'd think he'd break his sides laughin' at the frolicksome tricks of his goose. ,1607,1766
16,"So, in course o' time, the goose was the greatest pet in the country, and the biggest rogue, and distracted the King to no end. ",1766,1894
17,The poor King was as happy as the day was long. ,1894,1942
18,So that's the way it was. ,1942,1968
19,"All went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken in years, as well as the King, and grew stiff in the limbs, like her master, and couldn't distract him no longer. ",1968,2144
20,"Then it was that the poor King was lost completely, and didn't know what in the wide world to do. ",2144,2242
21,He was gone out of all distractions because the goose was no more in the flower of her blume. ,2242,2336
22,"Well, the King was nigh broken-hearted and melancholy entirely, and was walkin' one mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate, an' thinkin' o' drownin' himself, that could get no diversion in life, when all of a sudden, turnin' round the corner beyond, who should he meet but a mighty decent young man comin' up to him. ",2336,2672
23,"'God save you,' says the King (for the King was a civil-spoken gentleman, by all accounts), 'God save you,' says he to the young man. ",2672,2806
24,"'God save you kindly,' says the young man to him back again. ",2806,2867
25,"'God save you, King O'Toole.' ",2867,2897
26,"'True for you,' says the King, 'I am King O'Toole,' says he. ",2897,2958
27,"'Prince and plennypennytinchery o' these parts,' says he. ",2958,3016
28,'But how came you to know that?' ,3016,3049
29,says he. ,2949,2958
30,"'Oh, never mind,' says Saint Kavin (for 'twas he that was in it). ",3058,3124
31,"'And now, may I make bold to ask, how is your goose, King O'Toole?' ",3124,3192
32,says he. ,2949,2958
33,"'Blur-an-agers, how came you to know about my goose?' ",3201,3255
34,says the King. ,3255,3270
35,"'Oh, no mather. ",3270,3286
36,"I was given to understand it,' says Saint Kavin. ",3286,3335
37,"'Oh, that's a folly to talk,' says the King, 'because myself and my goose is private friends,' says he, 'and no one could tell you,' says he, 'barrin' the fairies.' ",3335,3500
38,"'Oh, then, it wasn't the fairies,' says Saint Kavin. ",3500,3553
39,"'For I'd have you know,' says he, 'that I don't keep the likes o' such company.' ",3553,3634
40,"'You might do worse, then, my gay fellow,' says the King. ",3634,3692
41,'For it's they could show you a crock o' money as easy as kiss hand. ,3692,3761
42,"And that's not to be sneezed at,' says the King, 'by a poor man,' says he. ",3761,3836
43,"'Maybe I've a better way of making money myself,' says the saint. ",3836,3902
44,"'By gor,' says the King, 'barrin' you're a coiner,' says he, 'that's impossible!' ",3902,3984
45,"'I'd scorn to be the like, my lord!' ",3984,4021
46,"says Saint Kavin, mighty high, 'I'd scorn to be the like,' says he. ",4021,4089
47,"'Then, what are you?' ",4089,4111
48,"says the King, 'that makes money so easy, by your own account.' ",4111,4175
49,"'I'm an honest man,' says Saint Kavin. ",4175,4214
50,"'Well, honest man,' says the King, 'and how is it you make your money so easy?' ",4214,4294
51,"'By makin' old things as good as new,' says Saint Kavin. ",4294,4351
52,'Is it a tinker you are?' ,4351,4377
53,says the King. ,3255,3270
54,"'No,' says the saint; ",4392,4414
55," 'I'm no tinker by trade, King O'Toole. ",4413,4453
56,"I've a better thrade than a tinker,' says he. ",4453,4499
57,"'What would you say,' says he, 'if I made your old goose as good as new?' ",4499,4573
58,"'My dear, at the word o' making his goose as good as new, you'd think the poor old King's eyes was ready to jump out of his head.' ",4573,4704
59,"'And,' says he--'truth, then, I'd give you more money nor you could count,' says he, 'if you did the like, and I'd be beholden to you in the bargain.' ",4704,4855
60,"'I scorn your dirty money,' says Saint Kavin. ",4855,4901
61,"'Faith, then, I'm thinkin' a trifle o' change would do you no harm,' says the King, lookin' up sly at the old hat that Saint Kavin had on him. ",4901,5044
62,"'I have a vow agin it,' says the saint. ",5044,5084
63,"'I am book sworn,' says he, 'never to have gold, silver, or brass in my company.' ",5084,5166
64,"'Barrin' the trifle you can't help,' says the King, mighty cute, and looking him straight in the face. ",5166,5269
65,"'You just hot it,' says Saint Kavin. ",5269,5306
66,"'But though I can't take money,' says he, 'I could take a few acres o' land, if you'd give them to me.' ",5306,5410
67,"'With all the veins o' my heart,' says the King, 'if you can do what you say.' ",5410,5489
68,'Try me!' ,5489,5499
69,says Saint Kavin. ,3317,3335
70,"'Call down your goose here,' says he, 'and I'll see what I can do for her.' ",5517,5593
71,"With that the King whistled, and down came the poor goose, all as one as a hound, waddlin' up to the poor old cripple, her master, and as like him as two pays. ",5593,5753
72,"The minute the saint set his eyes on the goose, 'I'll do the job for you,' says he, 'King O'Toole!' ",5753,5853
73,"'By Jaminee,' says King O'Toole, 'if you do, but I'll say you're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes.' ",5853,5963
74,"'Oh, by dad,' says Saint Kavin, 'you must say more nor that--my horn's not so soft all out,' says he, 'as to repair your old goose for nothin'. ",5963,6107
75,"'What'll you give me if I do the job for you?--that's the chat,' says Saint Kavin. ",6107,6190
76,"'I'll give you whatever you ask,' says the King. ",6190,6239
77,'isn't that fair?' ,6239,6258
78,"'Devil a fairer,' says the saint. ",6258,6292
79,'That's the way to do business. ,6292,6324
80,"Now,' says he, 'this is the bargain I'll make with you, King O'Toole: will you give me all the ground the goose flies over, the first offer, after I make her as good as new?' ",6324,6499
81,"'I will,' says the King. ",6499,6524
82,'You won't go back o' your word?' ,6524,6558
83,says Saint Kavin. ,3317,3335
84,'Honor bright!' ,6576,6592
85,"says King O'Toole, holdin' out his fist. ",6592,6633
86,"'Honor bright,' says Saint Kavin back again, 'it's a bargain,' says he. ",6633,6705
87,'Come here!' ,6705,6718
88,"says he to the poor old goose--'come here, you unfortunate old cripple,' says he, 'and it's I that'll make you the sportin' bird.' ",6718,6849
89,"'With that, my dear, he took up the goose by the two wings--criss o' my cross an you,' says he, markin' her to grace with the blessed sign at the same minute. ",6849,7008
90,"And throwin' her up in the air, 'whew!' ",7008,7048
91,"says he, just givin' her a blast to help her. ",7048,7094
92,"With that, my jewel, she took to her heels, flyin' like one o' the eagles themselves, and cuttin' as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain. ",7094,7245
93,"Away she went down there, right in front of you, along the side o' the cliff, and flew over Saint Kavin's bed (that is, where Saint Kavin's bed is now, but was not then, by reason as it wasn't made, but was contrived after by Saint Kavin himself, that the women might leave him alone). ",7245,7531
94,"And on with her under Lugduff, and round the end of the lake there, far beyond where you see the waterfall. ",7531,7639
95,"And on with her then right over the lead mines o' Luganure (that is, where the lead mines is now, but was not then, by reason they weren't discovered, but was all gold in Saint Kavin's time). ",7639,7831
96,"Well, over the end o' Luganure she flew, stout and studdy, and round the other end of the little lake, by the Churches (that is, of course, where the Churches is now, but was not then, by reason they were not built, but afterwards by Saint Kavin), and over the big hill here over your head, where you see the big cliff--(and that cliff in the mountain was made by Finn Ma Cool, where he cut it across with a big sword that he got made a purpose by a blacksmith out o' Rathdrum, a cousin of his own, for to fight a giant that dared him an' the Curragh o' Kildare. ",7831,8394
97,"He tried the sword first an the mountain, and cut it down into a gap, as is plain to this day. ",8394,8489
98,"Faith, sure enough, it's the same sauce he served the giant, soon and sudden, and chopped him in two like a potato, for the glory of his soul and old Ireland)--well, down she flew over the cliff, and flutterin' over the wood there at Poulanass. ",8489,8734
99,"'Well--as I said--afther flutterin' over the wood a little bit, to plaze herself, the goose flew down, and bit at the foot o' the King, as fresh as a daisy, after flyin' round his dominions, just as if she hadn't flew three perch.' ",8734,8966
100,"'Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the King standin' with his mouth open, lookin' at his poor old goose flyin' as light as a lark, and better nor ever she was. ",8966,9139
101,"When she let at his foot he patted her an the head, and ma vourneen,' says he, 'but you are the darling o' the world.' ",9139,9258
102,"'And what do you say to me,' says Saint Kavin, 'for makin' her the like?' ",9258,9332
103,"'By gor,' says the King, ""I say nothin' about the art o' men, barrin' the bees."" ",9332,9413
104,'And do you say no more nor that?' ,9413,9448
105,says Saint Kavin. ,3317,3335
106,"'And that I'm beholden to you,' says the King. ",9466,9513
107,'But will you give me all the ground the goose flew over?' ,9513,9572
108,says Saint Kavin. ,3317,3335
109,"'I will,' says King O'Toole, 'and you're welcome to it,' says he, 'though it's the last acre I have to give.' ",9590,9700
110,'But you'll keep your word true?' ,9700,9734
111,says the saint. ,3886,3902
112,"'As true as the sun,' says the King. ",9750,9787
113,"'It's well for you,' says Saint Kavin, mighty sharp--'it's well for you, King O'Toole, that you said that word,' says he. ",9787,9909
114,"'For if you didn't say that word, the devil recieve the bit o' your goose id ever fly again,' says Saint Kavin. ",9909,10021
115,"'Oh, you needn't laugh,' said old Joe, 'for it's truth I'm telling you.' ",10021,10094
116,"Well, when the King was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was pleased with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the King. ",10094,10229
117,"""Well, my dear, that's the way that the place came, all at once, into the hands of Saint Kavin. ",10229,10325
118,"The goose flew round every individual acre o' King O'Toole's property, you see, bein' let into the secret by Saint Kavin, who was mighty cute. ",10325,10468
119,"So, when he done the old King out of his property for the glory of God, he was pleased with him. ",10468,10565
120,"He and the King was the best o' friends ever more after (for the poor old King was doatin' , you see), and the King had his goose as good as new to distract him as long as he lived. ",10565,10747
121,"The saint supported him after he came into his property, as I told you, until the day of his death--and that was soon afther. ",10747,10873
122,The poor goose thought he was catchin' a trout one Friday. ,10873,10932
123,"But, my jewel, it was a mistake he made--and instead of a throut, it was a thievin' horse-eel! ",10932,11027
124,"and, by gor, instead of the goose killin' a trout for the King's supper--by dad, the eel killed the King's goose--and small blame to him. ",11027,11165
125,"But he didn't ate her, because he doesn't eat what Saint Kavin laid his blessed hands on.""",11165,11256
