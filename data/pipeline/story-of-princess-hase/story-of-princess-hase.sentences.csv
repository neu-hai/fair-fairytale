0,"Many, many years ago there lived in Nara, the ancient Capital of Japan, a wise State minister, by name Prince Toyonari Fujiwara. ",0,129
1,"His wife was a noble, good, and beautiful woman called Princess Murasaki (Violet). ",129,212
2,"They had been married by their respective families according to Japanese custom when very young, and had lived together happily ever since. ",212,352
3,"They had, however, one cause for great sorrow, for as the years went by no child was born to them. ",352,451
4,"This made them very unhappy, for they both longed to see a child of their own who would grow up to gladden their old age, carry on the family name, and keep up the ancestral rites when they were dead. ",451,652
5,"The Prince and his lovely wife, after long consultation and much thought, determined to make a pilgrimage to the temple of Hase-no-Kwannon (Goddess of Mercy at Hase). ",652,819
6,"They believed, according to the beautiful tradition of their religion, that the Mother of Mercy, Kwannon, comes to answer the prayers of mortals in the form that they need the most. ",819,1001
7,"Surely after all these years of prayer she would come to them in the form of a beloved child in answer to their special pilgrimage, for that was the greatest need of their two lives. ",1001,1184
8,"Everything else they had that this life could give them, but it was all as nothing because the cry of their hearts was unsatisfied. ",1184,1316
9,"So the Prince Toyonari and his wife went to the temple of Kwannon at Hase and stayed there for a long time, both daily offering incense and praying to Kwannon, the Heavenly Mother, to grant them the desire of their whole lives. ",1316,1544
10,And their prayer was answered. ,1544,1575
11,"A daughter was born at last to the Princess Murasaki, and great was the joy of her heart. ",1575,1665
12,"On presenting the child to her husband, they both decided to call her Hase-Hime, or the Princess of Hase, because she was the gift of the Kwannon at that place. ",1665,1826
13,"They both reared her with great care and tenderness, and the child grew in strength and beauty. ",1826,1922
14,When the little girl was five years old her mother fell dangerously ill and all the doctors and their medicines could not save her. ,1922,2054
15,"A little before she breathed her last she called her daughter to her, and gently stroking her head, said: ""Hase-Hime, do you know that your mother cannot live any longer? ",2054,2225
16,"Though I die, you must grow up a good girl. ",2225,2269
17,Do your best not to give trouble to your nurse or any other of your family. ,2269,2345
18,Perhaps your father will marry again and some one will fill my place as your mother. ,2345,2430
19,"If so do not grieve for me, but look upon your father's second wife as your true mother, and be obedient and filial to both her and your father. ",2430,2575
20,"Remember when you are grown up to be submissive to those who are your superiors, and to be kind to all those who are under you. ",2575,2703
21,Don't forget this. ,2703,2722
22,"I die with the hope that you will grow up a model woman."" ",2722,2780
23,"Hase-Hime listened in an attitude of respect while her mother spoke, and promised to do all that she was told. ",2780,2891
24,"There is a proverb which says ""As the soul is at three so it is at one hundred,"" and so Hase-Hime grew up as her mother had wished, a good and obedient little Princess, though she was now too young to understand how great was the loss of her mother. ",2891,3141
25,"Not long after the death of his first wife, Prince Toyonari married again, a lady of noble birth named Princess Terute. ",3141,3261
26,"Very different in character, alas! ",3261,3296
27,"to the good and wise Princess Murasaki, this woman had a cruel, bad heart. ",3296,3371
28,"She did not love her step-daughter at all, and was often very unkind to the little motherless girl, saving to herself: ""This is not my child! ",3371,3513
29,"this is not my child!"" ",3513,3536
30,But Hase-Hime bore every unkindness with patience. ,3536,3587
31,"She even waited upon her step-mother kindly and obeyed her in every way and never gave any trouble, just as she had been trained by her own good mother, so that the Lady Terute had no cause for complaint against her. ",3587,3804
32,"The little Princess was very diligent, and her favorite studies were music and poetry. ",3804,3891
33,"She would spend several hours practicing every day, and her father had the most proficient of masters he could find to teach her the koto (Japanese harp), the art of writing letters and verse. ",3891,4084
34,When she was twelve years of age she could play so beautifully that she and her step-mother were summoned to the Palace to perform before the Emperor. ,4084,4235
35,"It was the Festival of the Cherry Flowers, and there were great festivities at the Court. ",4235,4325
36,"The Emperor threw himself into the enjoyment of the season, and commanded that Princess Hase should perform before him on the koto, and that her mother Princess Terute should accompany her on the flute. ",4325,4528
37,"The Emperor sat on a raised dais, before which was hung a curtain of finely-sliced bamboo and purple tassels, so that His Majesty might see all and not be seen, for no ordinary subject was allowed to look upon his sacred face. ",4528,4755
38,"Hase-Hime was a skilled musician though so young, and often astonished her masters by her wonderful memory and talent. ",4755,4874
39,On this momentous occasion she played well. ,4874,4918
40,"But Princess Terute, her step-mother, who was a lazy woman and never took the trouble to practice daily, broke down in her accompaniment and had to request one of the Court ladies to take her place. ",4918,5117
41,"This was a great disgrace, and she was furiously jealous to think that she had failed where her step-daughter succeeded. ",5117,5238
42,To make matters worse the Emperor sent many beautiful gifts to the little Princess to reward her for playing so well at the Palace. ,5238,5370
43,"There was also now another reason why Princess Terute hated her step-daughter, for she had had the good fortune to have a son born to her, and in her inmost heart she kept saying: ""If only Hase-Hime were not here, my son would have all the love of his father."" ",5370,5631
44,"And never having learned to control herself, she allowed this wicked thought to grow into the awful desire of taking her step-daughter's life. ",5631,5774
45,So one day she secretly ordered some poison and poisoned some sweet wine. ,5774,5848
46,This poisoned wine she put into a bottle. ,5848,5890
47,Into another similar bottle she poured some good wine. ,5890,5945
48,"It was the occasion of the Boys' Festival on the fifth of May, and Hase-Hime was playing with her little brother. ",5945,6059
49,All his toys of warriors and heroes were spread out and she was telling him wonderful stories about each of them. ,6059,6173
50,They were both enjoying themselves and laughing merrily with their attendants when his mother entered with the two bottles of wine and some delicious cakes. ,6173,6330
51,"""You are both so good and happy."" ",6330,6364
52,"said the wicked Princess Terute with a smile, ""that I have brought you some sweet wine as a reward-and here are some nice cakes for my good children."" ",6364,6515
53,And she filled two cups from the different bottles. ,6515,6567
54,"Hase-Hime, never dreaming of the dreadful part her step-mother was acting, took one of the cups of wine and gave to her little step brother the other that had been poured out for him. ",6567,6751
55,"The wicked woman had carefully marked the poisoned bottle, but on coming into the room she had grown nervous, and pouring out the wine hurriedly had unconsciously given the poisoned cup to her own child. ",6751,6955
56,"All this time she was anxiously watching the little Princess, but to her amazement no change whatever took place in the young girl's face. ",6955,7094
57,"Suddenly the little boy screamed and threw himself on the floor, doubled up with pain. ",7094,7181
58,"His mother flew to him, taking the precaution to upset the two tiny jars of wine which she had brought into the room, and lifted him up. ",7181,7318
59,"The attendants rushed for the doctor, but nothing could save the child-he died within the hour in his mother's arms. ",7318,7435
60,"Doctors did not know much in those ancient times, and it was thought that the wine had disagreed with the boy, causing convulsions of which he died. ",7435,7584
61,Thus was the wicked woman punished in losing her own child when she had tried to do away with her step-daughter. ,7584,7697
62,"Instead of blaming herself, she began to hate Hase-Hime more than ever in the bitterness and wretchedness of her own heart. ",7697,7821
63,"She eagerly watched for an opportunity to do her harm, which was, however, long in coming. ",7821,7912
64,"When Hase-Hime was thirteen years of age, she had already become mentioned as a poetess of some merit. ",7912,8015
65,This was an accomplishment very much cultivated by the women of old Japan and one held in high esteem. ,8015,8118
66,"It was the rainy season at Nara, and floods were reported every day as doing damage in the neighborhood. ",8118,8223
67,"The river Tatsuta, which flowed through the Imperial Palace grounds, was swollen to the top of its banks. ",8223,8329
68,"The roaring of the torrents of water rushing along a narrow bed so disturbed the Emperor's rest day and night, that a serious nervous disorder was the result. ",8329,8488
69,An Imperial Edict was sent forth to all the Buddhist temples commanding the priests to offer up continuous prayers to Heaven to stop the noise of the flood. ,8488,8645
70,But this was of no avail. ,8645,8671
71,"Then it was whispered in Court circles that the Princess Hase, the daughter of Prince Toyonari Fujiwara, second minister at Court, was the most gifted poetess of the day, though still so young, and her masters confirmed the report. ",8671,8903
72,"Long ago, a beautiful and gifted maiden-poetess had moved Heaven by praying in verse, had brought down rain upon a land famished with drought-so said the ancient biographers of the poetess Ono-no-Komachi. ",8903,9108
73,"If the Princess Hase were to write a poem and offer it in prayer, might it not stop the noise of the rushing river and remove the cause of the Imperial illness? ",9108,9269
74,"What the Court said at last reached the ears of the Emperor himself, and he sent an order to the minister Prince Toyonari to this effect. ",9269,9407
75,Great indeed was Hase-Hime's fear and astonishment when her father sent for her and told her what was required of her. ,9407,9526
76,"Heavy, indeed, was the duty that was laid on her young shoulders-that of saving the Emperor's life by the merit of her verse. ",9526,9652
77,At last the day came and her poem was finished. ,9652,9700
78,It was written on a leaflet of paper heavily flecked with gold-dust. ,9700,9769
79,"With her father and attendants and some of the Court officials, she proceeded to the bank of the roaring torrent and raising up her heart to Heaven, she read the poem she had composed, aloud, lifting it heavenwards in her two hands. ",9769,10002
80,Strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round. ,10002,10056
81,"The waters ceased their roaring, and the river was quiet in direct answer to her prayer. ",10056,10145
82,After this the Emperor soon recovered his health. ,10145,10195
83,"His Majesty was highly pleased, and sent for her to the Palace and rewarded her with the rank of Chinjo-that of Lieutenant-General-to distinguish her. ",10195,10346
84,"From that time she was called Chinjo-hime, or the Lieutenant-General Princess, and respected and loved by all. ",10346,10457
85,There was only one person who was not pleased at Hase-Hime's success. ,10457,10527
86,That one was her stepmother. ,10527,10556
87,"Forever brooding over the death of her own child whom she had killed when trying to poison her step-daughter, she had the mortification of seeing her rise to power and honor, marked by Imperial favor and the admiration of the whole Court. ",10556,10795
88,Her envy and jealousy burned in her heart like fire. ,10795,10848
89,"Many were the lies she carried to her husband about Hase-Hime, but all to no purpose. ",10848,10934
90,"He would listen to none of her tales, telling her sharply that she was quite mistaken. ",10934,11021
91,"At last the step-mother, seizing the opportunity of her husband's absence, ordered one of her old servants to take the innocent girl to the Hibari Mountains, the wildest part of the country, and to kill her there. ",11021,11235
92,"She invented a dreadful story about the little Princess, saying that this was the only way to prevent disgrace falling upon the family-by killing her. ",11235,11386
93,"Katoda, her vassal, was bound to obey his mistress. ",11386,11438
94,"Anyhow, he saw that it would be the wisest plan to pretend obedience in the absence of the girl's father. ",11438,11544
95,He placed Hase-Hime in a palanquin and accompanied her to the most solitary place he could find in the wild district. ,11544,11662
96,"The poor child knew there was no good in protesting to her unkind step-mother at being sent away in this strange manner, so she went as she was told. ",11662,11812
97,"But the old servant knew that the young Princess was quite innocent of all the things her step-mother had invented to him as reasons for her outrageous orders, and he determined to save her life. ",11812,12008
98,"Unless he killed her, however, he could not return to his cruel task-mistress, so he decided to stay out in the wilderness. ",12008,12132
99,"With the help of some peasants he soon built a little cottage, and having sent secretly for his wife to come, these two good old people did all in their power to take care of the now unfortunate Princess. ",12132,12337
100,"She all the time trusted in her father, knowing that as soon as he returned home and found her absent, he would search for her. ",12337,12465
101,"Prince Toyonari, after some weeks, came home, and was told by his wife that his daughter Hime had done something wrong and had run away for fear of being punished. ",12465,12629
102,He was nearly ill with anxiety. ,12629,12661
103,"Every one in the house told the same story-that Hase-Hime had suddenly disappeared, none of them knew why or whither. ",12661,12779
104,"For fear of scandal he kept the matter quiet and searched everywhere he could think of, but all to no purpose. ",12779,12890
105,"One day, trying to forget his terrible worry, he called all his men together and told them to make ready for a several days' hunt in the mountains. ",12890,13038
106,"They were soon ready and mounted, waiting at the gate for their lord. ",13038,13108
107,"He rode hard and fast to the district of the Hibari Mountains, a great company following him. ",13108,13202
108,"He was soon far ahead of every one, and at last found himself in a narrow picturesque valley. ",13202,13296
109,"Looking round and admiring the scenery, he noticed a tiny house on one of the hills quite near, and then he distinctly heard a beautiful clear voice reading aloud. ",13296,13460
110,"Seized with curiosity as to who could be studying so diligently in such a lonely spot, he dismounted. ",13460,13562
111,"Leaving his horse to his groom, he walked up the hillside and approached the cottage. ",13562,13648
112,"As he drew nearer his surprise increased, for he could see that the reader was a beautiful girl. ",13648,13745
113,The cottage was wide open and she was sitting facing the view. ,13745,13808
114,"Listening attentively, he heard her reading the Buddhist scriptures with great devotion. ",13808,13897
115,"More and more curious, he hurried on to the tiny gate and entered the little garden, and looking up beheld his lost daughter Hase-Hime. ",13897,14033
116,She was so intent on what she was saying that she neither heard nor saw her father till he spoke. ,14033,14131
117,"""Hase-Hime!"" ",14131,14144
118,"he cried, ""it is you, my Hase-Hime!"" ",14144,14181
119,"Taken by surprise, she could hardly realize that it was her own dear father who was calling her, and for a moment she was utterly bereft of the power to speak or move. ",14181,14349
120,"""My father, my father! ",14349,14372
121,"It is indeed you-oh, my father!"" ",14372,14405
122,"was all she could say, and running to him she caught hold of his thick sleeve, and burying her face burst into a passion of tears. ",14405,14536
123,"Her father stroked her dark hair, asking her gently to tell him all that had happened, but she only wept on, and he wondered if he were not really dreaming. ",14536,14693
124,"Then the faithful old servant Katoda came out, and bowing himself to the ground before his master. ",14693,14792
125,"He poured out the long tale of wrong, telling him all that had happened, and how it was that he found his daughter in such a wild and desolate spot with only two old servants to take care of her. ",14792,14988
126,The Prince's astonishment and indignation knew no bounds. ,14988,15046
127,He gave up the hunt at once and hurried home with his daughter. ,15046,15110
128,"One of the company galloped ahead to inform the household of the glad news, and the step-mother hearing what had happened, and fearful of meeting her husband now that her wickedness was discovered, fled from the house and returned in disgrace to her father's roof, and nothing more was heard of her. ",15110,15410
129,The old servant Katoda was rewarded with the highest promotion in his master's service. ,15410,15498
130,"He lived happily to the end of his days, devoted to the little Princess, who never forgot that she owed her life to this faithful retainer. ",15498,15638
131,"She was no longer troubled by an unkind step-mother, and her days passed happily and quietly with her father. ",15638,15748
132,"As Prince Toyonari had no son, he adopted a younger son of one of the Court nobles to be his heir, and to marry his daughter Hase-Hime, and in a few years the marriage took place. ",15748,15928
133,"Hase-Hime lived to a good old age, and all said that she was the wisest, most devout, and most beautiful mistress that had ever reigned in Prince Toyonari's ancient house. ",15928,16100
134,"She had the joy of presenting her son, the future lord of the family, to her father just before he retired from active life. ",16100,16225
135,To this day there is preserved a piece of needle-work in one of the Buddhist temples of Kioto. ,16225,16320
136,"It is a beautiful piece of tapestry, with the figure of Buddha embroidered in the silky threads drawn from the stem of the lotus. ",16320,16450
137,This is said to have been the work of the hands of the good Princess Hase.,16450,16525
