0,"In the old land of Brittany, once called Cornwall, there lived a woman named Barbaik Bourhis, who spent all her days in looking after her farm with the help of her niece Tephany. ",0,179
1,"Early and late the two might be seen in the fields or in the dairy, milking cows, making butter, feeding fowls; ",179,291
2, working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too. ,290,355
3,"Perhaps it might have been better for Barbaik if she had left herself a little time to rest and to think about other things, for soon she grew to love money for its own sake, and only gave herself and Tephany the food and clothes they absolutely needed. ",355,609
4,"And as for poor people she positively hated them, and declared that such lazy creatures had no business in the world. ",609,727
5,"Well, this being the sort of person Barbaik was, it is easy to guess at her anger when one day she found Tephany talking outside the cowhouse to young Denis, who was nothing more than a day labourer from the village of Plover. ",727,954
6,"Seizing her niece by the arm, she pulled her sharply away, exclaiming: 'Are you not ashamed, girl, to waste your time over a man who is as poor as a rat, when there are a dozen more who would be only too happy to buy you rings of silver, if you would let them?' ",954,1216
7,"'Denis is a good workman, as you know very well,' answered Tephany, red with anger, 'and he puts by money too, and soon he will be able to take a farm for himself.' ",1216,1381
8,"'Nonsense,' cried Barbaik, 'he will never save enough for a farm till he is a hundred. ",1381,1468
9,I would sooner see you in your grave than the wife of a man who carries his whole fortune on his back.' ,1468,1572
10,'What does fortune matter when one is young and strong?' ,1572,1629
11,"asked Tephany, but her aunt, amazed at such words, would hardly let her finish. ",1629,1709
12,'What does fortune matter?' ,1709,1737
13,"repeated Barbaik, in a shocked voice. ",1737,1775
14,'Is it possible that you are really so foolish as to despise money? ,1775,1843
15,"If this is what you learn from Denis, I forbid you to speak to him, and I will have him turned out of the farm if he dares to show his face here again. ",1843,1995
16,Now go and wash the clothes and spread them out to dry.' ,1995,2052
17,"Tephany did not dare to disobey, but with a heavy heart went down the path to the river. ",2052,2141
18,"'She is harder than these rocks,' said the girl to herself, 'yes, a thousand times harder. ",2141,2232
19,"For the rain at least can at last wear away the stone, but you might cry for ever, and she would never care. ",2232,2341
20,"Talking to Denis is the only pleasure I have, and if I am not to see him I may as well enter a convent.' ",2341,2446
21,"Thinking these thoughts she reached the bank, and began to unfold the large packet of linen that had to be washed. ",2446,2561
22,"The tap of a stick made her look up, and standing before her she saw a little old woman, whose face was strange to her. ",2561,2681
23,"'You would like to sit down and rest, granny?' ",2681,2728
24,"asked Tephany, pushing aside her bundle. ",2728,2769
25,"'When the sky is all the roof you have, you rest where you will,' replied the old woman in trembling tones. ",2769,2877
26,"'Are you so lonely, then?' ",2877,2904
27,"inquired Tephany, full of pity. ",2904,2936
28,'Have you no friends who would welcome you into their houses?' ,2936,2999
29,The old woman shook her head. ,2999,3029
30,"'They all died long, long ago,' she answered, 'and the only friends I have are strangers with kind hearts.' ",3029,3137
31,"The girl did not speak for a moment, then held out the small loaf and some bacon intended for her dinner. ",3137,3243
32,"'Take this,' she said; ",3243,3266
33," 'to-day at any rate you shall dine well,' and the old woman took it, gazing at Tephany the while. ",3265,3364
34,"'Those who help others deserve to be helped,' she answered; ",3364,3424
35, 'your eyes are still red because that miser Barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the young man from Plover. ,3423,3533
36,"But cheer up, you are a good girl, and I will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day.' ",3533,3647
37,'You?' ,3647,3654
38,"cried Tephany, stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all about her affairs, but the old woman did not hear her. ",3654,3774
39,"'Take this long copper pin,' she went on, 'and every time you stick it in your dress Mother Bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages. ",3774,3948
40,"As long as the pin is in your dress you will be free, and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case again.' ",3948,4077
41,"Then, rising, she nodded to Tephany and vanished. ",4077,4127
42,"The girl stood where she was, as still as a stone. ",4127,4178
43,If it had not been for the pin in her hands she would have thought she was dreaming. ,4178,4263
44,"But by that token she knew it was no common old woman who had given it to her, but a fairy, wise in telling what would happen in the days to come. ",4263,4410
45,"Then suddenly Tephany's eyes fell on the clothes, and to make up for lost time she began to wash them with great vigour. ",4410,4531
46,"Next evening, at the moment when Denis was accustomed to wait for her in the shadow of the cowhouse, Tephany stuck the pin in her dress, and at the very same instant Barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields, to the plot where the cabbages grew. ",4531,4830
47,"With a heart as light as her footsteps, the girl ran from the house, and spent her evening happily with Denis. ",4830,4941
48,And so it was for many days after that. ,4941,4981
49,"Then, at last, Tephany began to notice something, and the something made her very sad. ",4981,5068
50,"At first, Denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as quickly as she did, but when he had taught her all the songs he knew, and told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man, he had nothing more to say to her, for he, like a great many other people, was fond of talking himself, but not of listening to any one else. ",5068,5425
51,"Sometimes, indeed, he never came at all, and the next evening he would tell Tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business, but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do. ",5425,5689
52,"Day by day her heart grew heavier and her cheeks paler, and one evening, when she had waited for him in vain, she put her water-pot on her shoulder and went slowly down to the spring. ",5689,5873
53,"On the path in front of her stood the fairy who had given her the pin, and as she glanced at Tephany she gave a little mischievous laugh and said: 'Why, my pretty maiden hardly looks happier than she did before, in spite of meeting her lover whenever she pleases.' ",5873,6138
54,"'He has grown tired of me,' answered Tephany in a trembling voice, 'and he makes excuses to stay away. ",6138,6241
55,Ah! ,6241,6245
56,"granny dear, it is not enough to be able to see him, I must be able to amuse him and to keep him with me. ",6245,6351
57,"He is so clever, you know. ",6351,6378
58,Help me to be clever too.' ,6378,6405
59,'Is that what you want?' ,6405,6430
60,cried the old woman. ,6430,6451
61,"'Well, take this feather and stick it in your hair, and you will be as wise as Solomon himself.' ",6451,6548
62,Blushing with pleasure Tephany went home and stuck the feather into the blue ribbon which girls always wear in that part of the country. ,6548,6685
63,"In a moment she heard Denis whistling gaily, and as her aunt was safely counting her cabbages, she hurried out to meet him. ",6685,6809
64,The young man was struck dumb by her talk. ,6809,6852
65,"There was nothing that she did not seem to know, and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of Brittany, but could compose them herself. ",6852,7009
66,"Was this really the quiet girl who had been so anxious to learn all he could teach her, or was it somebody else? ",7009,7122
67,"Perhaps she had gone suddenly mad, and there was an evil spirit inside her. ",7122,7198
68,"But in any case, night after night he came back, only to find her growing wiser and wiser. ",7198,7289
69,"Soon the neighbours whispered their surprise among themselves, for Tephany had not been able to resist the pleasure of putting the feather in her hair for some of the people who despised her for her poor clothes, and many were the jokes she made about them. ",7289,7547
70,"Of course they heard of her jests, and shook their heads saying: 'She is an ill-natured little cat, and the man that marries her will find that it is she who will hold the reins and drive the horse.' ",7547,7747
71,"It was not long before Denis began to agree with them, and as he always liked to be master wherever he went, he became afraid of Tephany's sharp tongue, and instead of laughing as before when she made fun of other people he grew red and uncomfortable, thinking that his turn would come next. ",7747,8039
72,"So matters went on till one evening Denis told Tephany that he really could not stay a moment, as he had promised to go to a dance that was to be held in the next village. ",8039,8211
73,Tephany's face fell; ,8211,8232
74," she had worked hard all day, and had been counting on a quiet hour with Denis. ",8231,8311
75,"She did her best to persuade him to remain with her, but he would not listen, and at last she grew angry. ",8311,8417
76,"'Oh, I know why you are so anxious not to miss the dance,' she said; ",8417,8486
77, 'it is because Aziliez of Pennenru will be there.' ,8485,8537
78,"Now Aziliez was the loveliest girl for miles round, and she and Denis had known each other from childhood. ",8537,8644
79,"'Oh yes, Aziliez will be there,' answered Denis, who was quite pleased to see her jealous, 'and naturally one would go a long way to watch her dance.' ",8644,8795
80,'Go then!' ,8795,8806
81,"cried Tephany, and entering the house she slammed the door behind her. ",8806,8877
82,Lonely and miserable she sat down by the fire and stared into the red embers. ,8877,8955
83,"Then, flinging the feather from her hair, she put her head on her hands, and sobbed passionately. ",8955,9053
84,'What is the use of being clever when it is beauty that men want? ,9053,9119
85,That is what I ought to have asked for. ,9119,9159
86,"But it is too late, Denis will never come back.' ",9159,9208
87,"'Since you wish it so much you shall have beauty,' said a voice at her side, and looking round she beheld the old woman leaning on her stick. ",9208,9350
88,"'Fasten this necklace round your neck, and as long as you wear it you will be the most beautiful woman in the world,' continued the fairy. ",9350,9489
89,"With a little shriek of joy Tephany took the necklace, and snapping the clasp ran to the mirror which hung in the corner. ",9489,9611
90,"Ah, this time she was not afraid of Aziliez or of any other girl, for surely none could be as fair and white as she. ",9611,9728
91,"And with the sight of her face a thought came to her, and putting on hastily her best dress and her buckled shoes she hurried off to the dance. ",9728,9872
92,On the way she met a beautiful carriage with a young man seated in it. ,9872,9943
93,'What a lovely maiden!' ,9943,9967
94,"he exclaimed, as Tephany approached. ",9967,10004
95,"'Why, there is not a girl in my own country that can be compared to her. ",10004,10077
96,"She, and no other, shall be my bride.' ",10077,10116
97,"The carriage was large and barred the narrow road, so Tephany was forced, much against her will, to remain where she was. ",10116,10238
98,"But she looked the young man full in the face as she answered: 'Go your way, noble lord, and let me go mine. ",10238,10347
99,"I am only a poor peasant girl, accustomed to milk, and make hay and spin.' ",10347,10422
100,"'Peasant you may be, but I will make you a great lady,' said he, taking her hand and trying to lead her to the carriage. ",10422,10543
101,"'I don't want to be a great lady, I only want to be the wife of Denis,' she replied, throwing off his hand and running to the ditch which divided the road from the cornfield, where he hoped to hide. ",10543,10742
102,"Unluckily the young man guessed what she was doing, and signed to his attendants, who seized her and put her in the coach. ",10742,10865
103,"The door was banged, and the horses whipped up into a gallop. ",10865,10927
104,"At the end of an hour they arrived at a splendid castle, and Tephany, who would not move, was lifted out and carried into the hall, while a priest was sent for to perform the marriage ceremony. ",10927,11121
105,"The young man tried to win a smile from her by telling of all the beautiful things she should have as his wife, but Tephany did not listen to him, and looked about to see if there was any means by which she could escape. ",11121,11342
106,It did not seem easy. ,11342,11364
107,"The three great doors were closely barred, and the one through which she had entered shut with a spring, but her feather was still in her hair, and by its aid she detected a crack in the wooden panelling, through which a streak of light could be dimly seen. ",11364,11622
108,"Touching the copper pin which fastened her dress, the girl sent every one in the hall to count the cabbages, while she herself passed through the little door, not knowing whither she was going. ",11622,11816
109,"By this time night had fallen, and Tephany was very tired. ",11816,11875
110,"Thankfully she found herself at the gate of a convent, and asked if she might stay there till morning. ",11875,11978
111,"But the portress answered roughly that it was no place for beggars, and bade her begone, so the poor girl dragged herself slowly along the road, till a light and the bark of a dog told her that she was near a farm. ",11978,12193
112,In front of the house was a group of people; ,12193,12238
113, two or three women and the sons of the farmer. ,12237,12285
114,"When their mother heard Tephany's request to be given a bed the good wife's heart softened, and she was just going to invite her inside, when the young men, whose heads were turned by the girl's beauty, began to quarrel as to which should do most for her. ",12285,12541
115,"From words they came to blows, and the women, frightened at the disturbance, pelted Tephany with insulting names. ",12541,12655
116,"She quickly ran down the nearest path, hoping to escape them in the darkness of the trees, but in an instant she heard their footsteps behind her. ",12655,12802
117,"Wild with fear her legs trembled under her, when suddenly she bethought herself of her necklace. ",12802,12899
118,"With a violent effort she burst the clasp and flung it round the neck of a pig which was grunting in a ditch, and as she did so she heard the footsteps cease from pursuing her and run after the pig, for her charm had vanished. ",12899,13126
119,"On she went, scarcely knowing where she was going, till she found herself, to her surprise and joy, close to her aunt's house. ",13126,13253
120,"For several days she felt so tired and unhappy that she could hardly get through her work, and to make matters worse Denis scarcely ever came near her. ",13253,13405
121,"'He was too busy,' he said, 'and really it was only rich people who could afford to waste time in talking.' ",13405,13513
122,"As the days went on Tephany grew paler and paler, till everybody noticed it except her aunt. ",13513,13606
123,"The water-pot was almost too heavy for her now, but morning and evening she carried it to the spring, though the effort to lift it to her shoulder was often too much for her. ",13606,13781
124,"'How could I have been so foolish,' she whispered to herself, when she went down as usual at sunset. ",13781,13882
125,"'It was not freedom to see Denis that I should have asked for, for he was soon weary of me, nor a quick tongue, for he was afraid of it, nor beauty, for that brought me nothing but trouble, but riches which make life easy both for oneself and others. ",13882,14133
126,Ah! ,6241,6245
127,"if I only dared to beg this gift from the fairy, I should be wiser than before and know how to choose better.' ",14137,14248
128,"'Be satisfied,' said the voice of the old woman, who seemed to be standing unseen at Tephany's elbow. ",14248,14350
129,'If you look in your right-hand pocket when you go home you will find a small box. ,14350,14433
130,"Rub your eyes with the ointment it contains, and you will see that you yourself contain a priceless treasure.' ",14433,14544
131,"Tephany did not in the least understand what she meant, but ran back to the farm as fast as she could, and began to fumble joyfully in her right-hand pocket. ",14544,14702
132,"Sure enough, there was the little box with the precious ointment. ",14702,14768
133,She was in the act of rubbing her eyes with it when Barbaik Bourhis entered the room. ,14768,14854
134,"Ever since she had been obliged to leave her work and pass her time, she did not know why, in counting cabbages, everything had gone wrong, and she could not get a labourer to stay with her because of her bad temper. ",14854,15071
135,"When, therefore, she saw her niece standing quietly before her mirror, Barbaik broke out: 'So this is what you do when I am out in the fields! ",15071,15214
136,Ah! ,6241,6245
137,it is no wonder if the farm is ruined. ,15218,15257
138,"Are you not ashamed, girl, to behave so?' ",15257,15299
139,"Tephany tried to stammer some excuse, but her aunt was half mad with rage, and a box on the ears was her only answer. ",15299,15417
140,"At this Tephany, hurt, bewildered and excited, could control herself no longer, and turning away burst into tears. ",15417,15532
141,But what was her surprise when she saw that each tear-drop was a round and shining pearl. ,15532,15622
142,"Barbaik, who also beheld this marvel, uttered a cry of astonishment, and threw herself on her knees to pick them up from the floor. ",15622,15754
143,She was still gathering them when the door opened and in came Denis. ,15754,15823
144,'Pearls! ,15823,15832
145,Are they really pearls?' ,15832,15857
146,"he asked, falling on his knees also, and looking up at Tephany he perceived others still more beautiful rolling down the girl's cheeks. ",15857,15993
147,"'Take care not to let any of the neighbours hear of it, Denis,' said Barbaik. ",15993,16071
148,"'Of course you shall have your share, but nobody else shall get a single one. ",16071,16149
149,"Cry on, my dear, cry on,' she continued to Tephany. ",16149,16201
150,"'It is for your good as well as ours,' and she held out her apron to catch them, and Denis his hat. ",16201,16301
151,But Tephany could hardly bear any more. ,16301,16341
152,"She felt half choked at the sight of their greediness, and wanted to rush from the hall, and though Barbaik caught her arm to prevent this, and said all sorts of tender words which she thought would make the girl weep the more, Tephany with a violent effort forced back her tears, and wiped her eyes. ",16341,16642
153,'Is she finished already?' ,16642,16669
154,"cried Barbaik, in a tone of disappointment. ",16669,16713
155,"'Oh, try again, my dear. ",16713,16738
156,Do you think it would do any good to beat her a little?' ,16738,16795
157,"she added to Denis, who shook his head. ",16795,16835
158,'That is enough for the first time. ,16835,16871
159,I will go into the town and find out the value of each pearl.' ,16871,16934
160,"'Then I will go with you,' said Barbaik, who never trusted anyone and was afraid of being cheated. ",16934,17033
161,"So the two went out, leaving Tephany behind them. ",17033,17083
162,"She sat quite still on her chair, her hands clasped tightly together, as if she was forcing something back. ",17083,17191
163,"At last she raised her eyes, which had been fixed on the ground, and beheld the fairy standing in a dark corner by the hearth, observing her with a mocking look. ",17191,17353
164,"The girl trembled and jumped up, then, taking the feather, the pin, and the box, she held them out to the old woman. ",17353,17470
165,"'Here they are, all of them,' she cried; ",17470,17511
166, 'they belong to you. ,17510,17532
167,"Let me never see them again, but I have learned the lesson that they taught me. ",17532,17612
168,"Others may have riches, beauty and wit, but as for me I desire nothing but to be the poor peasant girl I always was, working hard for those she loves.' ",17612,17764
169,"'Yes, you have learned your lesson,' answered the fairy, 'and now you shall lead a peaceful life and marry the man you love. ",17764,17889
170,For after all it was not yourself you thought of but him.' ,17889,17948
171,"Never again did Tephany see the old woman, but she forgave Denis for selling her tears, and in time he grew to be a good husband, who did his own share of work.",17948,18109
