0,"Once upon a time there was a man who lived not very far from John of Groat's house, which, as everyone knows, is in the very north of Scotland. ",0,144
1,"He lived in a little cottage by the sea-shore, and made his living by catching seals and selling their fur, which is very valuable. ",144,276
2,He earned a good deal of money in this way. ,276,320
3,"These creatures used to come out of the sea in large numbers, and lie on the rocks near his house basking in the sunshine. ",320,443
4,It was not difficult to creep up behind them and kill them. ,443,503
5,"Some of those seals were larger than others, and the country people used to call them ""Roane."" ",503,598
6,"They used to whisper that they were not seals at all, but Mermen and Merwomen. ",598,677
7,"They came from a country of their own, far down under the ocean, who assumed this strange disguise in order that they might pass through the water, and come up to breathe the air of this earth of ours. ",677,879
8,"But the seal catcher only laughed at them, and said that those seals were most worth killing. ",879,973
9,Their skins were so big that he got an extra price for them. ,973,1034
10,"Now it chanced one day, when he was pursuing his calling, that he stabbed a seal with his hunting-knife. ",1034,1139
11,"Whether the stroke had not been sure enough or not, I cannot say, but with a loud cry of pain the creature slipped off the rock into the sea, and disappeared under the water, carrying the knife along with it. ",1139,1348
12,"The seal catcher, much annoyed at his clumsiness, and also at the loss of his knife, went home to dinner in a very downcast frame of mind. ",1348,1487
13,"On his way he met a horseman, who was so tall and so strange-looking and who rode on such a gigantic horse, that he stopped and looked at him in astonishment. ",1487,1646
14,"He wondered who he was, and from what country he came. ",1646,1701
15,"The stranger stopped also, and asked him his trade. ",1701,1753
16,"On hearing that he was a seal catcher, he immediately ordered a great number of seal skins. ",1753,1845
17,"The seal catcher was delighted, for such an order meant a large sum of money to him. ",1845,1930
18,But his face fell when the horseman added that it was absolutely necessary that the skins should be delivered that evening. ,1930,2054
19,"""I cannot do it,"" he said in a disappointed voice, ""for the seals will not come back to the rocks again until to-morrow morning."" ",2054,2184
20,"""I can take you to a place where there are any number of seals,"" answered the stranger, ""if you will mount behind me on my horse and come with me."" ",2184,2332
21,"The seal catcher agreed to this, and climbed up behind the rider, who shook his bridle rein. ",2332,2425
22,Off the great horse galloped at such a pace that he had much ado to keep his seat. ,2425,2508
23,"On and on they went, flying like the wind, until at last they came to the edge of a huge precipice, the face of which went sheer down to the sea. ",2508,2654
24,Here the mysterious horseman pulled up his steed with a jerk. ,2654,2716
25,"""Get off now,"" he said shortly. ",2716,2748
26,The seal catcher did as he was bid. ,2748,2784
27,"When he found himself safe on the ground, he peeped cautiously over the edge of the cliff to see if there were any seals lying on the rocks below. ",2784,2931
28,"To his astonishment he saw no rocks, only the blue sea, which came right up to the foot of the cliff. ",2931,3033
29,"""Where are the seals that you spoke of?"" ",3033,3074
30,"he asked anxiously, wishing that he had never set out on such a rash adventure. ",3074,3154
31,"""You will see presently,"" answered the stranger, who was attending to his horse's bridle. ",3154,3244
32,"The seal catcher was now thoroughly frightened, for he felt sure that some evil was about to befall him. ",3244,3349
33,In such a lonely place he knew that it would be useless to cry out for help. ,3349,3426
34,"And it seemed as if his fears would prove only too true, for the next moment the stranger's hand was laid upon his shoulder. ",3426,3551
35,"He felt himself being hurled bodily over the cliff, and then he fell with a splash into the sea. ",3551,3648
36,"He thought that his last hour had come, and he wondered how anyone could work such a deed of wrong upon an innocent man. ",3648,3769
37,"But, to his astonishment, he found that some change must have passed over him. ",3769,3848
38,"Instead of being choked by the water, he could breathe quite easily. ",3848,3917
39,"He and his companion, who was still close at his side, seemed to be sinking as quickly down through the sea as they had flown through the air. ",3917,4060
40,"Down and down they went, nobody knows how far, till at last they came to a huge arched door, which appeared to be made of pink coral, studded over with cockle-shells. ",4060,4227
41,"It opened, of its own accord, and when they entered they found themselves in a huge hall, the walls of which were formed of mother-of-pearl, and the floor of which was of sea-sand, smooth, and firm, and yellow. ",4227,4438
42,"The hall was crowded with occupants, but they were seals, not men. ",4438,4505
43,"When the seal catcher turned to his companion to ask him what it all meant, he was aghast to find that he, too, had assumed the form of a seal. ",4505,4649
44,"He was still more aghast when he caught sight of himself in a large mirror that hung on the wall, and saw that he also no longer bore the likeness of a man, but was transformed into a nice, hairy, brown seal. ",4649,4858
45,"""Ah, woe to me,"" he said to himself, ""for no fault of mine own this crafty stranger has laid some harmful charm upon me, and in this awful guise will I remain for the rest of my natural life."" ",4858,5051
46,At first none of the huge creatures spoke to him. ,5051,5101
47,"For some reason or other they seemed to be very sad, and moved gently about the hall, talking quietly and mournfully to one another, or lay sadly upon the sandy floor, wiping big tears from their eyes with their soft furry fins. ",5101,5330
48,"But presently they began to notice him, and to whisper to one another. ",5330,5401
49,"Presently his guide moved away from him, and disappeared through a door at the end of the hall. ",5401,5497
50,When he returned he held a huge knife in his hand. ,5497,5548
51,"""Did you ever see this before?"" ",5548,5580
52,"he asked, holding it out to the unfortunate seal catcher. ",5580,5638
53,"He, to his horror, recognised his own hunting knife with which he had struck the seal in the morning, and which had been carried off by the wounded animal. ",5638,5794
54,At the sight of it he fell upon his face and begged for mercy. ,5794,5857
55,"He at once came to the conclusion that the inhabitants of the cavern, enraged at the harm which had been wrought upon their comrade, had, in some magic way, contrived to capture him, and to bring him down to their subterranean abode, in order to wreak their vengeance upon him by killing him. ",5857,6150
56,"But, instead of doing so, they crowded round him, rubbing their soft noses against his fur to show their sympathy. ",6150,6265
57,"They implored him not to put himself about, for no harm would befall him, and they would love him all their lives long if he would only do what they asked him. ",6265,6425
58,"""Tell me what it is,"" said the seal catcher, ""and I will do it, if it lies within my power."" ",6425,6518
59,"""Follow me,"" answered his guide, and he led the way to the door through which he had disappeared when he went to seek the knife. ",6518,6647
60,The seal catcher followed him. ,6647,6678
61,"And there, in a smaller room, he found a great brown seal lying on a bed of pale pink sea-weed, with a gaping wound in his side. ",6678,6807
62,"""That is my father,"" said his guide, ""who you wounded this morning, thinking that he was one of the common seals who live in the sea, instead of a Merman who has speech, and understanding, as you mortals have. ",6807,7017
63,"I brought you here to bind up his wounds, for no other hand than yours can heal him."" ",7017,7103
64,"""I have no skill in the art of healing,"" said the seal catcher, astonished at the forbearance of these strange creatures, whom he had so unwittingly wronged; ",7103,7261
65," ""but I will bind up the wound to the best of my power, and I am only sorry that it was my hands that caused it."" ",7260,7374
66,"He went over to the bed, and, stooping over the wounded Merman, washed and dressed the hurt as well as he could. ",7374,7487
67,"The touch of his hands appeared to work like magic, for no sooner had he finished than the wound seemed to deaden and die, leaving only the scar. ",7487,7633
68,"The old seal sprang up, as well as ever. ",7633,7674
69,Then there was great rejoicing throughout the whole Palace of the Seals. ,7674,7747
70,"They laughed, and they talked, and they embraced each other in their own strange way, crowding round their comrade. ",7747,7863
71,"They rubbed their noses against his, as if to show him how delighted they were at his recovery. ",7863,7959
72,"But all this while the seal catcher stood alone in a corner, with his mind filled with dark thoughts. ",7959,8061
73,"Although he saw now that they had no intention of killing him, he did not relish the prospect of spending the rest of his life in the guise of a seal, fathoms deep under the ocean. ",8061,8242
74,"But presently, to his great joy, his guide approached him, and said, ""Now you are at liberty to return home to your wife and children. ",8242,8377
75,"I will take you to them, but only on one condition."" ",8377,8430
76,"""And what is that?"" ",8430,8450
77,"asked the seal catcher eagerly, overjoyed at the prospect of being restored safely to the upper world, and to his family. ",8450,8572
78,"""That you will take a solemn oath never to wound a seal again."" ",8572,8636
79,"""That will I do right gladly,"" he replied. ",8636,8679
80,"For although the promise meant giving up his means of livelihood, he felt that if only he regained his proper shape he could always turn his hand to something else. ",8679,8844
81,"So he took the required oath with all due solemnity, holding up his fin as he swore, and all the other seals crowded round him as witnesses. ",8844,8985
82,"And a sigh of relief went through the halls when the words were spoken, for he was the most noted seal catcher in the North. ",8985,9110
83,"Then he bade the strange company farewell, and, accompanied by his guide, passed once more through the outer doors of coral, and up, and up, and up, through the shadowy green water, until it began to grow lighter and lighter and at last they emerged into the sunshine of earth. ",9110,9388
84,"Then, with one spring, they reached the top of the cliff, where the great black horse was waiting for them, quietly nibbling the green turf. ",9388,9529
85,When they left the water their strange disguise dropped from them. ,9529,9596
86,"They were now as they had been before, a plain seal catcher and a tall, well-dressed gentleman in riding clothes. ",9596,9710
87,"""Get up behind me,"" said the latter, as he swung himself into his saddle. ",9710,9784
88,"The seal catcher did as he was bid, taking tight hold of his companion's coat, for he remembered how nearly he had fallen off on his previous journey. ",9784,9935
89,Then it all happened as it happened before. ,9935,9979
90,"The bridle was shaken, and the horse galloped off. ",9979,10030
91,It was not long before the seal catcher found himself standing in safety before his own garden gate. ,10030,10131
92,"He held out his hand to say ""good-bye,"" but as he did so the stranger pulled out a huge bag of gold and placed it in it. ",10131,10252
93,"""You have done your part of the bargain--we must do ours,"" he said. ",10252,10320
94,"""Men shall never say that we took away an honest man's work without making reparation for it. ",10320,10414
95,"Here is what will keep you in comfort to your life's end."" ",10414,10473
96,"Then he vanished, and when the astonished seal catcher carried the bag into his cottage, and turned the gold out on the table, he found that what the stranger had said was true. ",10473,10651
97,He would be a rich man for the remainder of his days.,10651,10705
