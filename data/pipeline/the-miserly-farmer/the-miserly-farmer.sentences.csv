0,Once upon a time there was a farmer who had carted pears to market. ,0,68
1,"Since they were very sweet and fragrant, he hoped to get a good price for them. ",68,148
2,A bonze with a torn cap and tattered robe stepped up to his cart and asked for one. ,148,232
3,"The farmer repulsed him, but the bonze did not go. ",232,283
4,Then the farmer grew angry and began to call him names. ,283,339
5,"The bonze said: ""You have pears by the hundred in your cart. ",339,400
6,I only ask for one. ,400,420
7,Surely that does you no great injury. ,420,458
8,"Why suddenly grow so angry about it?"" ",458,496
9,The bystanders told the farmer that he ought to give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go. ,496,600
10,But the farmer would not and did not. ,600,638
11,"An artisan saw the whole affair from his shop, and since the noise annoyed him, he took some money, bought a pear and gave it to the bonze. ",638,778
12,"The bonze thanked him and said: ""One like myself, who has given up the world, must not be miserly. ",778,877
13,"I have beautiful pears myself, and I invite you all to eat them with me."" ",877,951
14,"Then some one asked: ""If you have pears then why do you not eat your own?"" ",951,1026
15,"He answered: ""I first must have a seed to plant."" ",1026,1076
16,And with that he began to eat the pear with gusto. ,1076,1127
17,"When he had finished, he held the pit in his hand, took his pick-ax from his shoulder; ",1127,1214
18, and dug a hole a couple of inches deep. ,1213,1254
19,"Into this he thrust the pit, and covered it with earth. ",1254,1310
20,"Then he asked the folk in the market place for water, with which to water it. ",1310,1388
21,"A pair of curiosity seekers brought him hot water from the hostelry in the street, and with it the bonze watered the pit. ",1388,1510
22,Thousands of eyes were turned on the spot. ,1510,1553
23,And the pit could already be seen to sprout. ,1553,1598
24,The sprout grew and in a moment it had turned into a tree. ,1598,1657
25,Branches and leaves burgeoned out from it. ,1657,1700
26,"It began to blossom and soon the fruit had ripened: large, fragrant pears, which hung in thick clusters from the boughs. ",1700,1821
27,The bonze climbed into the tree and handed down the pears to the bystanders. ,1821,1898
28,In a moment all the pears had been eaten up. ,1898,1943
29,Then the bonze took his pick-ax and cut down the tree. ,1943,1998
30,"Crash, crash! ",1998,2012
31,"so it went for a while, and the tree was felled. ",2012,2061
32,Then he took the tree on his shoulder and walked away at an easy gait. ,2061,2132
33,"When the bonze had begun to make his magic, the farmer, too, had mingled with the crowd. ",2132,2221
34,With neck outstretched and staring eyes he had stood there and had entirely forgotten the business he hoped to do with his pears. ,2221,2351
35,When the bonze had gone off he turned around to look after his cart. ,2351,2420
36,His pears had all disappeared. ,2420,2451
37,Then he realized that the pears the bonze had divided had been his own. ,2451,2523
38,"He looked more closely, and the axle of his cart had disappeared. ",2523,2589
39,It was plainly evident that it had been chopped off quite recently. ,2589,2657
40,The farmer fell into a rage and hastened after the bonze as fast as ever he could. ,2657,2740
41,"And when he turned the corner, there lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall. ",2740,2831
42,And then he realized that the pear-tree which the bonze had chopped down must have been his axle. ,2831,2929
43,"The bonze, however, was nowhere to be found. ",2929,2974
44,And the whole crowd in the market burst out into loud laughter.,2974,3038
