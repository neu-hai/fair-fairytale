318	345	311	311	he	17	" My father , my dreams forbode evil . May I break my fast now , and at a more favorable time make a new fast ? "
350	429	346	347	The father	4	" My son , you know not what you ask . If you get up now , all your glory will depart . Wait patiently a little longer . You have but three days more , and your term will be completed . You know it is for your own good , and I encourage you to persevere . Shall not your aged father live to see you a star among the chieftains and the beloved of battle ? "
509	526	505	506	the father	4	" Will you bring shame upon your father when his sun is falling in the west ? "
527	537	539	539	Iadilla	0	" I will not shame you , my father , "
690	792	688	688	himself	4	" My father has destroyed my fortune as a man . He would not listen to my requests . He has urged me beyond my tender strength . He will be the loser . I shall be forever happy in my new state , for I have been obedient to my parent . He alone will be the sufferer , for my guardian spirit is a just one . Though not propitious to me in the manner I desired , he has shown me pity in another way -- he has given me another shape ; and now I must go . "
804	818	796	798	the old man	30	" My son ! my son ! I pray you leave me not ! "
877	1038	858	858	He	31	" Regret not , my father , the change you behold . I shall be happier in my present state than I could have been as a man . I shall always be the friend of men , and keep near their dwellings . I shall ever be happy and contented ; and although I could not gratify your wishes as a warrior , it will be my daily aim to make you amends for it as a harbinger of peace and joy . I will cheer you by my songs , and strive to inspire in others the joy and lightsomeness of heart I feel in my present state . This will be some compensation to you for the loss of glory you expected . I am now free from the cares and pains of human life . My food is spontaneously furnished by the mountains and fields , and my pathway of life is in the bright air . "
