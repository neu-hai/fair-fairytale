0,In the middle of a great forest there lived a long time ago a charcoal-burner and his wife. ,0,92
1,They were both young and handsome and strong. ,92,138
2,"When they got married, they thought work would never fail them. ",138,202
3,"But bad times came, and they grew poorer and poorer. ",202,255
4,The nights in which they went hungry to bed became more and more frequent. ,255,330
5,Now one evening the king of that country was hunting near the charcoal-burner's hut. ,330,415
6,"As he passed the door, he heard a sound of sobbing. ",415,467
7,"Being a good-natured man he stopped to listen, thinking that perhaps he might be able to give some help. ",467,572
8,'Were there ever two people so unhappy!' ,572,613
9,said a woman's voice. ,613,635
10,"'Here we are, ready to work like slaves the whole day long, and no work can we get. ",635,719
11,And it is all because of the curiosity of old mother Eve! ,719,777
12,"If she had only been like me, who never want to know anything. ",777,840
13,"We should all have been as happy as kings to-day, with plenty to eat, and warm clothes to wear. ",840,936
14,Why--' but at this point a loud knock interrupted her lamentations. ,936,1004
15,'Who is there?' ,1004,1020
16,asked she. ,1020,1031
17,'I!' ,1031,1036
18,replied somebody. ,1036,1054
19,"'And who is ""I""?' ",1054,1072
20,'The king. ,1072,1083
21,Let me in.' ,1083,1095
22,Full of surprise the woman jumped up and pulled the bar away from the door. ,1095,1171
23,"As the king entered, he noticed that there was no furniture in the room at all, not even a chair. ",1171,1269
24,"He pretended to be in too great a hurry to see anything around him, and only said 'You must not let me disturb you. ",1269,1385
25,"I have no time to stay, but you seemed to be in trouble. ",1385,1442
26,Tell me; ,1442,1451
27, are you very unhappy?' ,1450,1474
28,"'Oh, my lord, we can find no work and have eaten nothing for two days!' ",1474,1546
29,answered she. ,1546,1560
30,'Nothing remains for us but to die of hunger.' ,1560,1607
31,"'No, no, you shan't do that,' cried the king, 'or if you do, it will be your own fault. ",1607,1695
32,You shall come with me into my palace. ,1695,1734
33,"You will feel as if you were in Paradise, I promise you. ",1734,1791
34,"In return, I only ask one thing of you, that you shall obey my orders exactly.' ",1791,1871
35,"The charcoal-burner and his wife both stared at him for a moment, as if they could hardly believe their ears. ",1871,1981
36,"Indeed, it was not to be wondered at! ",1981,2019
37,"Then they found their tongues, and exclaimed together: 'Oh, yes, yes, my lord! ",2019,2098
38,we will do everything you tell us. ,2098,2133
39,"How could we be so ungrateful as to disobey you, when you are so kind?' ",2133,2205
40,"The king smiled, and his eyes twinkled. ",2205,2245
41,"'Well, let us start at once,' said he. ",2245,2284
42,"'Lock your door, and put the key in your pocket.' ",2284,2334
43,"The woman looked as if she thought this was needless, seeing it was quite, quite certain they would never come back. ",2334,2451
44,"But she dared not say so, and did as the king told her. ",2451,2507
45,"After walking through the forest for a couple of miles, they all three reached the palace. ",2507,2598
46,"By the king's orders, servants led the charcoal-burner and his wife into rooms filled with beautiful things such as they had never even dreamed of. ",2598,2746
47,"First, they bathed in green marble baths where the water looked like the sea. ",2746,2824
48,"Then, they put on silken clothes that felt soft and pleasant. ",2824,2886
49,"When they were ready, one of the king's special servants entered, and took them into a small hall, where dinner was laid. ",2886,3008
50,This pleased them better than anything else. ,3008,3053
51,They were just about to sit down to the table when the king walked in. ,3053,3124
52,"'I hope you have been attended to properly,' said he, 'and that you will enjoy your dinner. ",3124,3216
53,My steward will take care you have all you want. ,3216,3265
54,I wish you to do exactly as you please. ,3265,3305
55,"Oh, by the bye, there is one thing! ",3305,3341
56,You notice that soup-tureen in the middle of the table? ,3341,3397
57,"Well, be careful on no account to lift the lid. ",3397,3445
58,"If once you take off the cover, there is an end of your good fortune.' ",3445,3516
59,"Then, bowing to his guests, he left the room. ",3516,3562
60,'Did you hear what he said?' ,3562,3591
61,inquired the charcoal-burner in an awe-stricken voice. ,3591,3646
62,"'We are to have what we want, and do what we please. ",3646,3699
63,Only we must not touch the soup-tureen.' ,3699,3740
64,"'No, of course we won't,' answered the wife. ",3740,3785
65,'Why should we wish to? ,3785,3809
66,But all the same it is rather odd. ,3809,3844
67,One can't help wondering what is inside.' ,3844,3886
68,For many days life went on like a beautiful dream to the charcoal-burner and his wife. ,3886,3973
69,"Their beds were so comfortable, they could hardly make up their minds to get up, and their clothes were so lovely they could scarcely bring themselves to take them off. ",3973,4142
70,Their dinners were so good that they found it very difficult to leave off eating. ,4142,4224
71,Then outside the palace were gardens filled with rare flowers and fruits and singing birds. ,4224,4316
72,"If they desired to go further, a golden coach, painted with wreaths of forget-me-nots and lined with blue satin, awaited their orders. ",4316,4451
73,Sometimes it happened that the king came to see them. ,4451,4505
74,"He smiled as he glanced at the man, who was getting rosier and plumper each day. ",4505,4586
75,"But when his eyes rested on the woman, they took on a look which seemed to say 'I knew it,' though this neither the charcoal-burner nor his wife ever noticed. ",4586,4745
76,'Why are you so silent?' ,4745,4770
77,asked the man one morning when dinner had passed before his wife had uttered one word. ,4770,4857
78,'A little while ago you used to be chattering all the day long. ,4857,4921
79,Now I have almost forgotten the sound of your voice.' ,4921,4975
80,"'Oh, nothing; ",4975,4989
81," I did not feel inclined to talk, that was all!' ",4988,5037
82,"She stopped, and added carelessly after a pause, 'Don't you ever wonder what is in that soup-tureen?' ",5037,5139
83,"'No, never,' replied the man. ",5139,5169
84,"'It is no affair of ours,' and the conversation dropped once more. ",5169,5236
85,"As time went on, the woman spoke less and less, and seemed so wretched that her husband grew quite frightened about her. ",5236,5357
86,"As to her food, she refused one thing after another. ",5357,5410
87,"'My dear wife,' said the man at last, 'you really must eat something. ",5410,5480
88,What in the world is the matter with you? ,5480,5522
89,If you go on like this you will die.' ,5522,5560
90,"'I would rather die than not know what is in that tureen,' she burst forth so violently that the husband was quite startled. ",5560,5685
91,'Is that it?' ,5685,5699
92,cried he; ,5699,5709
93, 'are you making yourself miserable because of that? ,5708,5761
94,"Why, you know we should be turned out of the palace, and sent away to starve.' ",5761,5840
95,"'Oh no, we shouldn't. ",5840,5862
96,The king is too good-natured. ,5862,5892
97,Of course he didn't mean a little thing like this! ,5892,5943
98,"Besides, there is no need to lift the lid off altogether. ",5943,6001
99,Just raise one corner so that I may peep. ,6001,6043
100,We are quite alone: nobody will ever know.' ,6043,6087
101,The man hesitated. ,6087,6106
102,It did seem a 'little thing.' ,6106,6136
103,If it was to make his wife contented and happy it was well worth the risk. ,6136,6211
104,"So he took hold of the handle of the cover and raised it very slowly and carefully, while the woman stooped down to peep. ",6211,6333
105,Suddenly she startled back with a scream. ,6333,6375
106,"For a small mouse had sprung from the inside of the tureen, and had nearly hit her in the eye. ",6375,6470
107,Round and round the room it ran. ,6470,6503
108,"Round and round they both ran after it, knocking down chairs and vases in their efforts to catch the mouse and put it back in the tureen. ",6503,6641
109,In the middle of all the noise the door opened. ,6641,6689
110,The mouse ran out between the feet of the king. ,6689,6737
111,In one instant both the man and his wife were hiding under the table. ,6737,6807
112,To all appearance the room was empty. ,6807,6845
113,"'You may as well come out,' said the king, 'and hear what I have to say.' ",6845,6919
114,"'I know what it is,' answered the charcoal-burner, hanging his head. ",6919,6988
115,'The mouse has escaped.' ,6988,7013
116,"'A guard of soldiers will take you back to your hut,' said the king. ",7013,7082
117,'Your wife has the key.' ,7082,7107
118,'Weren't they silly?' ,7107,7129
119,cried the grandchildren of the charcoal-burners when they heard the story. ,7129,7204
120,'How we wish that we had had the chance! ,7204,7245
121,WE should never have wanted to know what was in the soup-tureen!',7245,7311
