0,Once upon a time there dwelt in the land of Erin a young man who was seeking a wife. ,0,85
1,Of all the maidens round about none pleased him as well as the only daughter of a farmer. ,85,175
2,The girl was willing and the father was willing. ,175,224
3,Very soon they were married and went to live at the farm. ,224,282
4,"By and bye the season came when they must cut the peats and pile them up to dry, so that they might have fires in the winter. ",282,408
5,"So on a fine day the girl and her husband, and the father and his wife all went out upon the moor. ",408,507
6,They worked hard for many hours. ,507,540
7,"At length grew hungry, so the young woman was sent home to bring them food, and also to give the horses their dinner. ",540,658
8,"When she went into the stables, she suddenly saw the heavy pack-saddle of the speckled mare just over her head. ",658,770
9,"She jumped and said to herself: 'Suppose that pack-saddle were to fall and kill me, how dreadful it would be!' ",770,881
10,"and she sat down just under the pack-saddle she was so much afraid of, and began to cry. ",881,970
11,Now the others out on the moor grew hungrier and hungrier. ,970,1029
12,'What can have become of her?' ,1029,1060
13,asked they. ,1060,1072
14,"At length the mother declared that she would wait no longer, and must go and see what had happened. ",1072,1172
15,"As the bride was nowhere in the kitchen or the dairy, the old woman went into the stable. ",1172,1262
16,She found her daughter weeping bitterly. ,1262,1303
17,"'What is the matter, my dove?' ",1303,1334
18,"and the girl answered, between her sobs: 'When I came in and saw the pack-saddle over my head, I thought how dreadful it would be if it fell and killed me.' ",1334,1491
19,She cried louder than before. ,1491,1521
20,"The old woman struck her hands together: 'Ah, to think of it! ",1521,1583
21,"if that were to be, what should I do?' ",1583,1622
22,She sat down by her daughter. ,1622,1652
23,They both wrung their hands and let their tears flow. ,1652,1706
24,"'Something strange must have occurred,' exclaimed the old farmer on the moor, who by this time was not only hungry, but cross. ",1706,1833
25,'I must go after them.' ,1833,1857
26,And he went and found them in the stable. ,1857,1899
27,'What is the matter?' ,1899,1921
28,asked he. ,1921,1931
29,'Oh!' ,1931,1937
30,"replied his wife, 'when our daughter came home, did she not see the pack-saddle over her head. ",1937,2032
31,She thought how dreadful it would be if it were to fall and kill her.' ,2032,2103
32,"'Ah, to think of it!' ",2103,2125
33,"exclaimed he, striking his hands together. ",2125,2168
34,He sat down beside them and wept too. ,2168,2206
35,As soon as night fell the young man returned full of hunger. ,2206,2267
36,"There they were, all crying together in the stable. ",2267,2319
37,'What is the matter?' ,1899,1921
38,asked he. ,1921,1931
39,"'When thy wife came home,' answered the farmer, 'she saw the pack-saddle over her head. ",2351,2439
40,She thought how dreadful it would be if it were to fall and kill her.' ,2032,2103
41,"'Well, but it didn't fall,' replied the young man. ",2510,2561
42,"He went off to the kitchen to get some supper, leaving them to cry as long as they liked. ",2561,2651
43,"The next morning he got up with the sun, and said to the old man and to the old woman and to his wife: 'Farewell: my foot shall not return to the house till I have found other three people as silly as you.' ",2651,2858
44,"He walked away till he came to the town, and seeing the door of a cottage standing open wide. ",2858,2952
45,He entered. ,2952,2964
46,"No man was present, but only some women spinning at their wheels. ",2964,3030
47,"'You do not belong to this town,' said he. ",3030,3073
48,"'You speak truth,' they answered, 'nor you either?' ",3073,3125
49,"'I do not,' replied he, 'but is it a good place to live in?' ",3125,3186
50,The women looked at each other. ,3186,3218
51,"'The men of the town are so silly that we can make them believe anything we please,' said they. ",3218,3314
52,"'Well, here is a gold ring,' replied he, 'and I will give it to the one amongst you who can make her husband believe the most impossible thing.' ",3314,3459
53,He left them. ,3459,3473
54,As soon as the first husband came home his wife said to him: 'Thou art sick!' ,3473,3551
55,'Am I?' ,3551,3559
56,asked he. ,1921,1931
57,"'Yes, thou art,' she answered; ",3569,3600
58, 'take off thy clothes and lie down.' ,3599,3637
59,So he did. ,3637,3648
60,When he was in his bed his wife went to him and said: 'Thou art dead.' ,3648,3719
61,"'Oh, am I?' ",3719,3731
62,asked he. ,1921,1931
63,"'Thou art,' said she; ",3741,3763
64, 'shut thine eyes and stir neither hand nor foot.' ,3762,3813
65,And dead he felt sure he was. ,3813,3843
66,Soon the second man came home. ,3843,3874
67,His wife said to him: 'You are not my husband!' ,3874,3922
68,"'Oh, am I not?' ",3922,3938
69,asked he. ,1921,1931
70,"'No, it is not you,' answered she. ",3948,3983
71,He went away and slept in the wood. ,3983,4019
72,When the third man arrived his wife gave him his supper. ,4019,4076
73,"After that he went to bed, just as usual. ",4076,4118
74,"The next morning a boy knocked at the door, bidding him attend the burial of the man who was dead. ",4118,4217
75,He was just going to get up when his wife stopped him. ,4217,4272
76,"'Time enough,' said she. ",4272,4297
77,He lay still till he heard the funeral passing the window. ,4297,4356
78,"'Now rise, and be quick,' called the wife. ",4356,4399
79,"The man jumped out of bed in a great hurry, and began to look about him. ",4399,4472
80,"'Why, where are my clothes?' ",4472,4501
81,asked he. ,1921,1931
82,"'Silly that you are, they are on your back, of course,' answered the woman. ",4511,4587
83,'Are they?' ,4587,4599
84,said he. ,3064,3073
85,"'They are,' said she, 'and make haste lest the burying be ended before you get there.' ",4608,4695
86,"Then off he went, running hard. ",4695,4727
87,"When the mourners saw a man coming towards them with nothing on but his nightshirt, they forgot in their fright what they were there for, and fled to hide themselves. ",4727,4894
88,And the naked man stood alone at the head of the coffin. ,4894,4951
89,Very soon a man came out of the wood and spoke to him. ,4951,5006
90,'Do you know me?' ,5006,5024
91,"'Not I,' answered the naked man. ",5024,5057
92,'I do not know you.' ,5057,5078
93,'But why are you naked?' ,5078,5103
94,asked the first man. ,5103,5124
95,'Am I naked? ,5124,5137
96,"My wife told me that I had all my clothes on,' answered he. ",5137,5197
97,"'And my wife told me that I myself was dead,' said the man in the coffin. ",5197,5271
98,But at the sound of his voice the two men were so terrified that they ran straight home. ,5271,5360
99,The man in the coffin got up and followed them. ,5360,5408
100,"It was his wife that gained the gold ring, as he had been sillier than the other two.",5408,5494
