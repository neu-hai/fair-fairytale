0,"ONCE upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes. ",0,89
1,He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; ,89,151
2, and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody. ,150,199
3,"TIMMY TIPTOES sat out, enjoying the breeze; ",199,243
4," he whisked his tail and chuckled--""Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; ",242,316
5," we must lay up a store for winter and spring."" ",315,363
6,"Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--""The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."" ",363,477
7,"""Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring-time,"" replied prudent Timothy. ",477,588
8,"WHEN Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already. ",588,689
9,Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; ,689,738
10, they worked away quietly by themselves. ,737,778
11,EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. ,778,846
12,"They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest. ",846,966
13,"WHEN these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; ",966,1088
14, the nuts rattled down--down--down inside. ,1087,1130
15,"""How shall you ever get them out again? ",1130,1170
16,"It is like a money-box!"" ",1170,1195
17,said Goody. ,1195,1207
18,"""I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,"" said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole. ",1207,1305
19,THEY did collect quantities--because they did not lose them! ,1305,1366
20,"Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place. ",1366,1471
21,The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. ,1471,1534
22,"He began to dig, and he could not remember. ",1534,1578
23,And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; ,1578,1648
24, and there was a fight. ,1647,1671
25,"And other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion! ",1671,1739
26,"UNFORTUNATELY, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. ",1739,1870
27,"There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs. ",1870,1940
28,"The first one sang--""Who's bin digging-up MY nuts? ",1940,1991
29,"Who's-been-digging-up MY nuts?"" ",1991,2023
30,"And another sang--""Little bita bread and-NO-cheese! ",2023,2075
31,"Little bit-a-bread and-NO-cheese!"" ",2075,2110
32,THE squirrels followed and listened. ,2110,2147
33,"The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang--""Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts? ",2147,2296
34,"Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?"" ",2296,2328
35,Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; ,2328,2382
36," indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer. ",2381,2432
37,"It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all. ",2432,2499
38,"BUT when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. ",2499,2633
39,"The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright! ",2633,2716
40,"Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting--""Who's-been digging-up MY-nuts?"" ",2716,2868
41,"THEY caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in. ",2868,2986
42,The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure. ,2986,3041
43,"They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs. ",3041,3116
44,"""We will leave him here till he confesses,"" said Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole-- ""Who's-been-digging-up MY-nuts?"" ",3116,3250
45,TIMMY TIPTOES made no reply; ,3250,3279
46," he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. ",3278,3363
47,He lay quite stunned and still. ,3363,3395
48,GOODY TIPTOES picked up the nut bags and went home. ,3395,3447
49,She made a cup of tea for Timmy; ,3447,3480
50, but he didn't come and didn't come. ,3479,3516
51,Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. ,3516,3565
52,Next morning she ventured back to the nut-bushes to look for him; ,3565,3631
53, but the other unkind squirrels drove her away. ,3630,3678
54,"She wandered all over the wood, calling-- ""Timmy Tiptoes! ",3678,3736
55,Timmy Tiptoes! ,3721,3736
56,"Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?"" ",3751,3780
57,IN the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. ,3780,3830
58,"He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; ",3830,3916
59, it seemed to be under ground. ,3915,3946
60,"Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him. ",3946,4002
61,"There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better? ",4002,4112
62,It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; ,4112,4147
63, it lent him its nightcap; ,4146,4173
64, and the house was full of provisions. ,4172,4211
65,"THE Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree--""Besides, I found a few buried!"" ",4211,4320
66,It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story. ,4320,4373
67,"While Timmy was confined to bed, it enticed him to eat quantities--""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself? ",4373,4510
68,"My wife will be anxious!"" ",4510,4536
69,"""Just another nut--or two nuts; ",4536,4568
70," let me crack them for you,"" said the Chipmunk. ",4567,4615
71,Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter! ,4615,4653
72,NOW Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. ,4653,4705
73,"She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again. ",4705,4827
74,She hid them under a tree root; ,4827,4859
75," they rattled down, down, down. ",4858,4890
76,"Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; ",4890,4963
77," and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry. ",4962,5059
78,"""IT is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; ",5059,5105
79," the sitting-room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; ",5104,5171
80," and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me. ",5170,5228
81,"What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?"" ",5228,5279
82,"""I am sure I beg your pardon; ",5279,5309
83," I did not not know that anybody lived here,"" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; ",5308,5379
84," ""but where is Chippy Hackee? ",5378,5408
85,"My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too."" ",5408,5454
86,"""I know where Chippy is; ",5454,5479
87," a little bird told me,"" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee. ",5478,5528
88,"SHE led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole. ",5528,5601
89,"Down below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together-- ""My little old man and I fell out, How shall we bring this matter about? ",5601,5795
90,"Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!"" ",5795,5869
91,"""You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,"" said Goody Tiptoes. ",5869,5945
92,"""Yes, I could,"" said the Chipmunk, ""but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!"" ",5945,6020
93,Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; ,6020,6080
94," and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang-- ""For the diddlum day Day diddle dum di! ",6079,6187
95,"Day diddle diddle dum day!"" ",6187,6215
96,"THEN Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--""Timmy Tiptoes! ",6215,6282
97,"Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!"" ",6282,6306
98,"And Timmy replied, ""Is that you, Goody Tiptoes? ",6306,6354
99,"Why, certainly!"" ",6354,6371
100,He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; ,6371,6417
101, but he was so fat that he could not get out. ,6416,6462
102,"Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; ",6462,6522
103, he stayed down below and chuckled. ,6521,6557
104,AND so it went on for a fortnight; ,6557,6592
105," till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain. ",6591,6682
106,"Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella. ",6682,6743
107,"BUT Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable. ",6743,6832
108,AT last a large bear came walking through the wood. ,6832,6884
109,Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; ,6884,6922
110, he seemed to be sniffing around. ,6921,6955
111,CHIPPY HACKEE went home in a hurry! ,6955,6991
112,"AND when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; ",6991,7067
113, and he was more uncomfortable still. ,7066,7104
114,And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut-store fastened up with a little padlock. ,7104,7192
115,"AND whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings--""Who's-been-digging-up MY-nuts? ",7192,7284
116,"Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?"" ",2296,2328
117,But nobody ever answers!,7316,7341
