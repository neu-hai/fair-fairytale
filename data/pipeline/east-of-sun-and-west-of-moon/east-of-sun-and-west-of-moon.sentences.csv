0,"ONCE upon a time there was a poor tenant farmer who had a number of children whom he could feed but poorly, and had to clothe in the scantiest way. ",0,148
1,They were all handsome; ,148,172
2," but the most beautiful, after all, was the youngest daughter. ",171,234
3,She was beautiful beyond all telling. ,234,272
4,Now it happened that one Thursday evening late in the fall there was a terrible storm raging outside. ,272,374
5,"It was pitch dark, and it rained and stormed so that the house shook in every joint. ",374,459
6,"The whole family sat around the hearth, and each was busy with some work or other. ",459,542
7,Suddenly there were three loud knocks on the window-pane. ,542,600
8,The man went out to see who was there. ,600,639
9,"When he stepped outside, there stood a great white bear. ",639,696
10,"""Good evening,"" said the white bear. ",696,733
11,"""Good evening,"" returned the man. ",733,767
12,"""If you'll give me your youngest daughter, I will make you just as rich as now you are poor,"" said the bear. ",767,876
13,The man was not ill-pleased that he was to become so rich. ,876,935
14,He did think that first he ought to speak to his daughter about it. ,935,1003
15,"So he went in again, and said that there was a white bear outside, who had promised to make him just as rich as he was poor now, if he could only have the youngest daughter for his bride. ",1003,1191
16,"But the girl said no, and would not hear of it. ",1191,1239
17,"Then the man went back to the bear again, and they both agreed that the white bear should return again the following Thursday and get his answer. ",1239,1385
18,"In the meantime, however, the parents worked upon their daughter. ",1385,1451
19,"They talked at length about all the riches they would gain, and how well she herself would fare. ",1451,1548
20,"So at last she agreed, washed and mended the few poor clothes she had, adorned herself as well as she could, and made ready to travel. ",1548,1683
21,"And what she was given to take along with her is not worth mentioning, either. ",1683,1762
22,The following Thursday the white bear came to fetch his bride. ,1762,1825
23,"The girl seated herself on his back with her bundle, and then he trotted off. ",1825,1903
24,"After they had gone a good way, the white bear asked: ""Are you afraid?"" ",1903,1975
25,"""No, not at all,"" she answered. ",1975,2007
26,"""Just keep a tight hold on my fur, and then you will be in no danger,"" said the bear. ",2007,2093
27,"So she rode on the bear's back, far, far away, until at last they came to a great rock. ",2093,2181
28,"There the bear knocked, and at once a door opened through which they entered a great castle, with many brilliantly lighted rooms, where everything gleamed with gold and silver. ",2181,2358
29,"Then they came into a great hall, and there stood a table completely covered with the most splendid dishes. ",2358,2466
30,"Here the white bear gave the maiden a silver bell, and said that if there were anything she wanted, she need only ring the bell, and she should have it at once. ",2466,2627
31,"And after the maiden had eaten, and evening came on, she felt like lying down and going to sleep. ",2627,2725
32,So she rang her bell. ,2725,2747
33,"At its very first peal she found herself transported to a room in which stood the most beautiful bed one might wish to have, with silken cushions and curtains with golden tassels. ",2747,2927
34,All that was in the room was of gold and silver. ,2927,2976
35,"Yet when she had lain down and put out the light, she saw a man come in and cast himself down in a corner. ",2976,3083
36,"It was the white bear, who was allowed to throw off his fur at night. ",3083,3153
37,"The maiden never actually saw him, for he never came until she had put out the light. ",3153,3239
38,Before dawn brightened he had disappeared again. ,3239,3288
39,For a time all went well; ,3288,3314
40, but gradually the maiden grew sad and silent. ,3313,3360
41,"She had not a soul to keep her company the live-long day, and she felt very homesick for her parents and sisters. ",3360,3474
42,"When the white bear asked her what troubled her, she told him she was always alone, and that she wanted so very much to see her parents and sisters again. ",3474,3629
43,She felt very sad because she could not do so. ,3629,3676
44,"""O that can be managed,"" said the white bear. ",3676,3722
45,"""But first you must promise me that you will never speak to your mother alone; ",3722,3801
46, but only when others are present. ,3800,3835
47,"Very likely she will take you by the hand, and want to lead you into her room, so that she can speak to you alone. ",3835,3950
48,"But this you must not allow, otherwise you will make us both unhappy."" ",3950,4021
49,"And then, one Sunday, the white bear actually came and told her that now she might make the trip to her parents. ",4021,4134
50,"So she seated herself on the bear's back, and the bear set out. ",4134,4198
51,"After they had gone a very long distance, they at length came to a fine, large, white house, before which her brothers and sisters were running about and playing. ",4198,4361
52,All was so rich and splendid that it was a real pleasure merely to look at it. ,4361,4440
53,"""This is where your parents live,"" said the white bear. ",4440,4496
54,"""Only do not forget what I told you, or you will make us both unhappy."" ",4496,4568
55,"Heaven forbid that she should forget it, said the maiden. ",4568,4626
56,"When she had come to the house, she got down, and the bear turned back. ",4626,4698
57,"When the daughter entered her parents' home, they were more than happy. ",4698,4770
58,"They told her that they could not thank her enough for what she had done, and that now all of them were doing splendidly. ",4770,4892
59,Then they asked her how she herself fared. ,4892,4935
60,"The maiden answered that all was well with her, also, and that she had all that heart could desire. ",4935,5035
61,I do not know exactly all the other things she told them. ,5035,5093
62,I do not believe she told them every last thing there was to tell. ,5093,5160
63,"So in the afternoon, when the family had eaten dinner, it happened as the white bear had foretold. ",5160,5259
64,"The mother wanted to talk to her daughter alone, in her room. ",5259,5321
65,"She thought of what the white bear had told her, and did not want to go with her mother, but said: ""All we have to say to each other can just as well be said here."" ",5321,5486
66,"Yet she herself did not know exactly how it happened her mother finally did persuade her, and then she had to tell just how things were. ",5486,5623
67,"So she informed her that as soon as she put out the light at night, a man came and cast himself down in the corner of the room. ",5623,5751
68,"She had never yet seen him, for he always went away before the dawn brightened. ",5751,5831
69,"And this grieved her, for she did want to see him so very much, and she was alone through the day, and it was very dreary and lonely. ",5831,5965
70,"""Alas, perhaps he is a troll, after all,"" said the mother. ",5965,6024
71,"""But I can give you some good advice as to how you can see him. ",6024,6088
72,"Here is a candle-end, which you must hide under your wimple. ",6088,6149
73,"When the troll is sleeping, light the light and look at him. ",6149,6210
74,"But be careful not to let a drop of tallow fall on him."" ",6210,6267
75,"The daughter took the candle-end and hid it in her wimple, and in the evening the white bear came to fetch her. ",6267,6379
76,After they had gone a way the white bear asked whether everything had not happened just as he had said. ,6379,6483
77,"Yes, such had been the case, and the maiden could not deny it. ",6483,6546
78,"""If you have listened to your mother's advice, then you will make us both unhappy, and all will be over between us,"" said the bear. ",6546,6678
79,"""O, no, she had not done so,"" replied the maiden, indeed she had not. ",6678,6748
80,"When they reached home, and the maiden had gone to bed, all went as usual: a man came in and cast himself down in a corner of the room. ",6748,6884
81,"But in the night, when she heard him sleeping soundly, she stood up and lighted the candle. ",6884,6976
82,"She threw the light on him, and saw the handsomest prince one might wish to see. ",6976,7057
83,And she liked him so exceedingly well that she thought she would be unable to keep on living if she could not kiss him that very minute. ,7057,7194
84,"She did so, but by mistake she let three hot drops of tallow fall on him, and he awoke. ",7194,7282
85,"""Alas, what have you done!"" ",7282,7310
86,cried he. ,7310,7320
87,"""Now you have made both of us unhappy. ",7320,7359
88,"If you had only held out until the end of the year, I would have been delivered. ",7359,7440
89,"I have a step-mother who has cast a spell on me, so that by day I am a bear, and at night a human being. ",7440,7545
90,"But now all is over between us, and I must return to my step-mother. ",7545,7614
91,"She lives in a castle that is east of the sun and west of the moon, where there is a princess with a nose three yards long, whom I must now marry."" ",7614,7762
92,"The maiden wept and wailed to no avail, for the prince said he must journey away. ",7762,7844
93,Then she asked him whether she might not go with him. ,7844,7898
94,"No, said he, that could not be. ",7898,7930
95,"""But can you not at least tell me the road, so that I can search for you. ",7930,8004
96,"For surely that will be permitted me?"" ",8004,8043
97,"""Yes, that you may do,"" said he. ",8043,8076
98,"""But there is no road that leads there. ",8076,8116
99,"The castle lies east of the sun and west of the moon, and neither now nor at any other time will you find the road to it!"" ",8116,8239
100,"When the maiden awoke the next morning, the prince as well as the castle had disappeared. ",8239,8329
101,"She lay in a green opening in the midst of a thick, dark wood, and beside her lay the bundle of poor belongings she had brought from home. ",8329,8468
102,"And when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and had cried her fill, she set out and wandered many, many days, until at last she came to a great hill. ",8468,8625
103,And before the hill sat an old woman who was playing with a golden apple. ,8625,8699
104,"The maiden asked the woman whether she did not know which road led to the prince who lived in the castle that was east of the sun and west of the moon, and who was to marry a princess with a nose three yards long. ",8699,8913
105,"""How do you come to know him?"" ",8913,8944
106,asked the woman. ,8944,8961
107,"""Are you, perhaps, the maiden he wanted to marry?"" ",8961,9012
108,"""Yes, I am that maiden,"" she replied. ",9012,9050
109,"""So you are that girl,"" said the woman. ",9050,9090
110,"""Well, my child, I am sorry to say that all I know of him is that he lives in the castle that is east of the sun and west of the moon, and that you will probably never get there. ",9090,9269
111,"But I will loan you my horse, on which you may ride to my neighbor, and perhaps she can tell you. ",9269,9367
112,"And when you get there just give the horse a blow back of his left ear, and order him to go home. ",9367,9465
113,"And here, take this golden apple along!"" ",9465,9506
114,"The maiden mounted the horse, and rode a long, long time. ",9506,9564
115,"At length she again came to a hill, before which sat an old woman with a golden reel. ",9564,9650
116,The maiden asked whether she could not tell her the road which led to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. ,9650,9778
117,"This woman said just what the other had, no, she knew no more of the castle than that it lay east of the sun and west of the moon. ",9778,9909
118,"""And,"" said she, ""you will probably never get there. ",9909,9962
119,But I will loan you my horse to ride to the nearest neighbor. ,9962,10024
120,Perhaps she can tell you. ,10024,10050
121,"And when you have reached her just give the horse a blow back of his left ear, and order him to go home again."" ",10050,10162
122,"And finally she gave the maiden the golden reel, for, said the old woman, it might be useful to her. ",10162,10263
123,"The maiden then mounted the horse, and again rode a long, long time. ",10263,10332
124,"At length she once more came to a great hill, before which sat an old woman spinning at a golden spindle. ",10332,10438
125,"Then the maiden once more asked after the prince, and the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. ",10438,10550
126,And everything happened exactly as on the two previous occasions. ,10550,10616
127,"""Do you happen to be the maiden the prince wanted to marry?"" ",10616,10677
128,asked the old woman. ,10677,10698
129,"""Yes, I am that maiden,"" answered the maiden. ",10698,10744
130,But this old woman knew no more about the road than the two others. ,10744,10812
131,"""Yes, the castle lies east of the sun and west of the moon, that I know,"" said she. ",10812,10896
132,"""And you will probably never get there. ",10896,10936
133,"But I will loan you my horse, and you may ride on it to the East Wind and ask him. ",10936,11019
134,"Perhaps he is acquainted there, and can blow you thither. ",11019,11077
135,"And when you reach him, just give my horse a blow back of the left ear, and then he will return here of his own accord."" ",11077,11198
136,Finally the old woman gave her her golden spindle. ,11198,11249
137,"""Perhaps it may be useful to you,"" said she. ",11249,11294
138,"The maiden now rode for many days and weeks, and it took a long, long time before she came to the East Wind. ",11294,11403
139,But at last she did find him.Then she asked the East Wind whether he could show her the road that led to the prince who lived in the castle that was east of the sun and west of the moon. ,11403,11590
140,"O, yes, he had heard tell of the prince, and of the castle as well, said the East Wind. ",11590,11678
141,"But he did not know the road that led to it, for he had never blown so far. ",11678,11754
142,"""But if you wish, I will take you to my brother, the West Wind, and perhaps he can tell you, for he is much stronger than I am. ",11754,11882
143,"Just sit down on my back, and I will carry you to him."" ",11882,11938
144,"The maiden did as he told her, and then they moved swiftly away. ",11938,12003
145,"When they came to the West Wind, the East Wind said that here he was bringing the maiden whom the prince who lived in the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon had wanted to marry. ",12003,12199
146,"He said that she was journeying on her way to him, and looking for him everywhere. ",12199,12282
147,He said that he had accompanied her in order to find out whether the West Wind knew where this castle might be. ,12282,12394
148,"""No,"" said the West Wind to the maiden, ""I have never blown so far, but if you wish I will take you to the South Wind, who is much stronger than both of us. ",12394,12551
149,"He has traveled far and wide, and perhaps he can tell you. ",12551,12610
150,"Seat yourself on my back, and I will carry you to him."" ",12610,12666
151,"The maiden did so, and then they flew quickly off to the South Wind. ",12666,12735
152,"When they found him, the West Wind asked whether the South Wind could show them the road that led to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. ",12735,12894
153,He also said that this was the maiden who was to have the prince. ,12894,12960
154,"""Well, well, so this is the girl?"" ",12960,12995
155,cried the South Wind. ,12995,13017
156,"""Yes, it is true that I have gone about a good deal during my life,"" said he, ""yet I have never blown so far. ",13017,13127
157,"But if you wish, I will take you to my brother, the North Wind. ",13127,13191
158,He is the oldest and strongest of us all. ,13191,13233
159,"If he does not know where the castle lies, then no one in the whole world can tell you. ",13233,13321
160,"Seat yourself on my back, and I will carry you to him."" ",12610,12666
161,"The maiden seated herself on the back of the South Wind, and he flew away with a roar and a rush. ",13377,13475
162,The journey did not take long. ,13475,13506
163,"When they had reached the dwelling of the North Wind, the latter was so wild and unmannerly that he blew a cold blast at them while they were still a good way off. ",13506,13670
164,"""What do you want?"" ",13670,13690
165,"cried he, as soon as he caught sight of them, so that a cold shiver ran down their backs. ",13690,13780
166,"""You should not greet us so rudely,"" said the South Wind. ",13780,13838
167,"""It is I, the South Wind. ",13838,13864
168,And this is the maiden who wanted to marry the prince who lives in the castle that lies east of the sun and west of the moon. ,13864,13990
169,"She wishes to ask you whether you have ever been there, and if you can show her the road that leads to it. ",13990,14097
170,"She would like to find the prince again."" ",14097,14139
171,"""O, yes, I know very well where the castle lies,"" said the North Wind. ",14139,14210
172,"""I blew an aspen leaf there just once, and then I was so weary that I could not blow at all for many a long day. ",14210,14323
173,"But if you want to get there above all things, and are not afraid of me, I will take you on my back, and see whether I can blow you there."" ",14323,14463
174,"The maiden said that she must and would get to the castle, if it were by any means possible. ",14463,14556
175,"She was not afraid, no matter how hard the journey might be. ",14556,14617
176,"""Very well, then you must stay here over night,"" said the North Wind. ",14617,14687
177,"""For if we are to get there to-morrow, we must have the whole day before us."" ",14687,14765
178,Early the next morning the North Wind awakened the maiden. ,14765,14824
179,"Then he blew himself up, and made himself so large and thick that he was quite horrible to look at. ",14824,14924
180,Thereupon they rushed along through the air as though they meant to reach the end of the world at once. ,14924,15028
181,"And everywhere beneath them raged such a storm that forests were pulled out by the roots, and houses torn down. ",15028,15140
182,"As they rushed across the sea, ships foundered by the hundreds. ",15140,15204
183,"Further and further they went, so far that no one could even imagine it, and still they were flying across the sea. ",15204,15320
184,"Gradually the North Wind grew weary, and became weaker and weaker. ",15320,15387
185,"Finally he could hardly keep going, and sank lower and lower. ",15387,15449
186,At last he flew so low that the waves washed his ankles. ,15449,15506
187,"""Are you afraid?"" ",1957,1975
188,asked the North Wind. ,15524,15546
189,"""No, not at all,"" answered the maiden. ",15546,15585
190,By now they were not far distant from the land. ,15585,15633
191,"The North Wind had just enough strength left to be able to set down the maiden on the strand, beneath the windows of the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon. ",15633,15808
192,And then he was so wearied and wretched that he had to rest many a long day before he could set out for home again. ,15808,15924
193,The next morning the maiden seated herself beneath the windows of the castle and played with the golden apple. ,15924,16035
194,"The first person who showed herself was the monster with the nose, whom the prince was to marry. ",16035,16132
195,"""What do you want for your golden apple?"" ",16132,16174
196,"asked the princess with the nose, as she opened the window. ",16174,16234
197,"""I will not sell it at all, either for gold or for money,"" answered the maiden. ",16234,16314
198,"""Well, what do you want for it, if you will not sell it either for gold or for money?"" ",16314,16401
199,asked the princess. ,16401,16421
200,"""Ask what you will!"" ",16421,16442
201,"""I only want to speak to-night to the prince who lives here, then I will give you the apple,"" said the maiden who had come with the North Wind. ",16442,16586
202,"The princess replied that this could be arranged, and then she received the golden apple. ",16586,16676
203,"But when the maiden came into the prince's room in the evening, he was sleeping soundly. ",16676,16765
204,"She called and shook him, wept and wailed. ",16765,16808
205,"But she could not wake him, and in the morning, as soon as it dawned, the princess with the long nose came and drove her out. ",16808,16934
206,"That day the maiden again sat beneath the windows of the castle, and wound her golden reel. ",16934,17026
207,And all went as on the preceding day. ,17026,17064
208,"The princess asked what she wanted for the reel, and the maiden answered that she would sell it neither for gold nor for money. ",17064,17192
209,"If she might speak that night to the prince, then she would give the reel to the princess. ",17192,17283
210,"Yet when the maiden came to the prince, he was again fast asleep, and no matter how much she wept and wailed, and cried and shook, she could not wake him. ",17283,17438
211,"But as soon as day dawned, and it grew bright, the princess with the long nose came and drove her out. ",17438,17541
212,"And that day the maiden again seated herself beneath the windows of the castle, and spun with her golden spindle. ",17541,17655
213,"Of course, the princess with the long nose wanted to have that, too. ",17655,17724
214,"She opened the window, and asked what she wanted for the golden spindle. ",17724,17797
215,"The maiden replied, as she had twice before, that she would sell the spindle neither for gold nor money. ",17797,17902
216,The princess could have it if she might speak to the prince again that night. ,17902,17980
217,"Yes, that she was welcome to do, said the princess, and took the golden spindle. ",17980,18061
218,"Now it happened that some Christians, who were captives in the castle, and quartered in a room beside that of the prince, had heard a woman weeping and wailing pitifully in the prince's room for the past two nights. ",18061,18277
219,So they told the prince. ,18277,18302
220,"And that evening when the princess came to him with his night-cap, the prince pretended to drink it. ",18302,18403
221,"He instead poured it out behind his back, for he could well imagine that she had put a sleeping-powder into the cup. ",18403,18520
222,"Then, when the maiden came in, the prince was awake, and she had to tell him just how she had found the castle. ",18520,18632
223,"""You have come just in the nick of time,"" said he, ""for to-morrow I am to marry the princess. ",18632,18726
224,"I do not want the monster with the nose at all, and you are the only person who can save me. ",18726,18819
225,"I will say that first I wish to see whether my bride is a capable housewife, and demand that she wash the three drops of tallow from my shirt. ",18819,18962
226,"She will naturally agree to this, for she does not know that you made the spots, for only Christian hands can wash them out again, but not the hands of this pack of trolls. ",18962,19135
227,"Then I will say I will marry none other than the maiden who can wash out the spots, and ask you to do so,"" said the prince. ",19135,19259
228,And then both rejoiced and were happy beyond measure. ,19259,19313
229,"But on the following day, when the wedding was to take place, the prince said: ""First I would like to see what my bride can do!"" ",19313,19442
230,"Yes, that was no more than right, said his mother-in-law. ",19442,19500
231,"""I have a very handsome shirt,"" continued the prince, ""which I would like to wear at the wedding. ",19500,19598
232,"But there are three tallow-spots on it, and they must first be washed out. ",19598,19673
233,And I have made a vow to marry none other than the woman who can do this. ,19673,19747
234,"So if my bride cannot manage to do it, then she is worthless."" ",19747,19810
235,"Well, that would not be much of a task, said the women, and agreed to the proposal. ",19810,19894
236,"And the princess with the long nose at once began to wash. She washed with all her might and main, and took the greatest pains, but the longer she washed and rubbed, the larger grew the spots. ",19894,20087
237,"""O, you don't know how to wash!"" ",20087,20120
238,"said her mother, the old troll-wife. ",20120,20157
239,"""Just give it to me!"" ",20157,20179
240,"But no sooner had she taken the shirt in her hand, than it began to look worse, and the more she washed and rubbed, the larger and blacker grew the spots. ",20179,20334
241,Then the other troll-women had to come and wash. ,20334,20383
242,"The longer they washed the shirt the uglier it grew, and finally it looked as though it had been hanging in the smokestack. ",20383,20507
243,"""Why, all of you are worthless!"" ",20507,20540
244,said the prince. ,19242,19259
245,"""Outside the window sits a beggar-girl. ",20557,20597
246,I'm sure she is a better washer-woman than all of you put together. ,20597,20665
247,"You, girl, come in here!"" ",20665,20691
248,he cried out of the window; ,20691,20719
249," and when the maiden came in he said: ""Do you think you can wash this shirt clean for me?"" ",20718,20809
250,"""I do not know,"" answered the maiden, ""but I will try."" ",20809,20865
251,"And no more had she dipped the shirt in the water than it turned as white as newly fallen snow, yes, even whiter. ",20865,20979
252,"""Indeed, and you are the one I want!"" ",20979,21017
253,said the prince. ,19242,19259
254,Then the old troll-woman grew so angry that she burst in two. ,21034,21096
255,"The princess with the long nose and the rest of the troll-pack probably burst in two as well, for I never heard anything more of them. ",21096,21231
256,"The prince and his bride then freed all the Christians who had been kept captive in the castle, and packed up as much gold and silver as they could possibly take with them, and went far away from the castle that lies East of the sun and West of the moon.",21231,21486
