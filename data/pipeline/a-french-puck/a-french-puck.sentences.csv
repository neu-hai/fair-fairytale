0,Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit. ,0,115
1,"It was this spirit's delight to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys. ",115,224
2,"They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. ",224,357
3,"Indeed, there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle. ",357,444
4,"At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he never was able to imitate the hole. ",444,555
5,"Every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew. ",555,619
6,Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight. ,619,742
7,"This was just when the shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound asleep. ",742,846
8,"Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang to the ground. ",846,997
9,"The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the cowboys, however fatigued they might be. ",997,1094
10,They dragged themselves wearily to the stable to put back the chains. ,1094,1164
11,"But no sooner had they returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on till the morning. ",1164,1274
12,"Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning. ",1274,1458
13,"Puck, hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying himself amazingly all the time. ",1458,1569
14,One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating loudly. ,1569,1716
15,"William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner. ",1716,1848
16,"So he went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it could hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on his way. ",1848,1998
17,"The sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and staggered along as best he could under his load. ",1998,2109
18,"'It is not much further,' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue of walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and made him jump. ",2109,2269
19,'Where are you?' ,2269,2286
20,"said the voice, and the sheep answered: 'Here on the shoulders of a donkey.' ",2286,2363
21,In another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and William was running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him. ,2363,2492
22,"But as he went, a laugh, which yet was something of a bleat, rang in his ears. ",2492,2571
23,"Though he tried not to hear, the words reached him, 'Oh, dear! ",2571,2634
24,"What fun I have had, to be sure!' ",2634,2668
25,"Puck was careful not always to play his tricks in the same place, but visited one village after another, so that everyone trembled lest he should be the next victim. ",2668,2834
26,"After a bit he grew tired of cowboys and shepherds, and wondered if there was no one else to give him some sport. ",2834,2948
27,At length he was told of a young couple who were going to the nearest town to buy all that they needed for setting up house. ,2948,3073
28,"Quite certain that they would forget something which they could not do without, Puck waited patiently till they were jogging along in their cart on their return journey. ",3073,3243
29,He changed himself into a fly in order to overhear their conversation. ,3243,3314
30,"For a long time it was very dull--all about their wedding day next month, and who were to be invited. ",3314,3416
31,"This led the bride to her wedding dress, and she gave a little scream. ",3416,3487
32,'Just think! ,3487,3500
33,Oh! ,3500,3504
34,how could I be so stupid! ,3504,3530
35,I have forgotten to buy the different coloured reels of cotton to match my clothes!' ,3530,3615
36,"'Dear, dear!' ",3615,3629
37,exclaimed the young man. ,3629,3654
38,'That is unlucky. ,3654,3672
39,Didn't you tell me that the dressmaker was coming in to-morrow?' ,3672,3737
40,"'Yes, I did,' and then suddenly she gave another little scream, which had quite a different sound from the first. ",3737,3851
41,'Look! ,3851,3858
42,Look!' ,3858,3865
43,"The bridegroom looked, and on one side of the road he saw a large ball of thread of all colours. ",3865,3962
44,"All the colours, that is, of the dresses that were tied on to the back of the cart. ",3962,4046
45,"'Well, that is a wonderful piece of good fortune,' cried he, as he sprang out to get it. ",4046,4135
46,'One would think a fairy had put it there on purpose.' ,4135,4190
47,"'Perhaps she has,' laughed the girl. ",4190,4227
48,"As she spoke she seemed to hear an echo of her laughter coming from the horse, but of course that was nonsense. ",4227,4339
49,The dressmaker was delighted with the thread that was given her. ,4339,4404
50,"It matched the stuffs so perfectly, and never tied itself in knots, or broke perpetually, as most thread did. ",4404,4514
51,She finished her work much quicker than she expected and the bride said she was to be sure to come to the church and see her in her wedding dress. ,4514,4661
52,There was a great crowd assembled to witness the ceremony. ,4661,4720
53,"The young people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood, and their parents were very rich. ",4720,4817
54,"The doors were open, and the bride could be seen from afar, walking under the chestnut avenue. ",4817,4912
55,'What a beautiful girl!' ,4912,4937
56,exclaimed the men. ,4937,4956
57,'What a lovely dress!' ,4956,4979
58,whispered the women. ,4979,5000
59,"But just as she entered the church and took the hand of the bridegroom, who was waiting for her, a loud noise was heard. ",5000,5121
60,'Crick! ,5121,5129
61,crack! ,5129,5136
62,Crick! ,5122,5129
63,crack!' ,5143,5151
64,"and the wedding garments fell to the ground, to the great confusion of the wearer. ",5151,5234
65,Not that the ceremony was put off for a little thing like that! ,5234,5298
66,"Cloaks in profusion were instantly offered to the young bride, but she was so upset that she could hardly keep from tears. ",5298,5421
67,"One of the guests, more curious than the rest, stayed behind to examine the dress, determined, if she could, to find out the cause of the disaster. ",5421,5569
68,"'The thread must have been rotten,' she said to herself. ",5569,5626
69,'I will see if I can break it.' ,5626,5658
70,But search as she would she could find none. ,5658,5703
71,The thread had vanished!,5703,5728
