0,Once upon a time there was a fisherman who had a wife and three children. ,0,74
1,"Every morning he used to go out fishing, and whatever fish he caught he sold to the King. ",74,164
2,"One day, among the other fishes, he caught a golden crab. ",164,222
3,"When he came home he put all the fishes together into a great dish, but he kept the Crab separate because it shone so beautifully, and placed it upon a high shelf in the cupboard. ",222,402
4,"Now while the old woman, his wife, was cleaning the fish, and had tucked up her gown so that her feet were visible, she suddenly heard a voice, which said: 'Let down, let down thy petticoat That lets thy feet be seen.' ",402,621
5,"She turned round in surprise, and then she saw the little creature, the Golden Crab. ",621,706
6,'What! ,706,713
7,"You can speak, can you, you ridiculous crab?' ",713,759
8,"she said, for she was not quite pleased at the Crab's remarks. ",759,822
9,Then she took him up and placed him on a dish. ,822,869
10,"When her husband came home and they sat down to dinner, they presently heard the Crab's little voice saying, 'Give me some too.' ",869,998
11,"They were all very much surprised, but they gave him something to eat. ",998,1069
12,"When the old man came to take away the plate which had contained the Crab's dinner, he found it full of gold, and as the same thing happened every day he soon became very fond of the Crab. ",1069,1258
13,"One day the Crab said to the fisherman's wife, 'Go to the King and tell him I wish to marry his younger daughter.' ",1258,1373
14,"The old woman went accordingly, and laid the matter before the King, who laughed a little at the notion of his daughter marrying a crab, but did not decline the proposal altogether, because he was a prudent monarch, and knew that the Crab was likely to be a prince in disguise. ",1373,1651
15,"He said, therefore, to the fisherman's wife, 'Go, old woman, and tell the Crab I will give him my daughter if by to-morrow morning he can build a wall in front of my castle much higher than my tower, upon which all the flowers of the world must grow and bloom.' ",1651,1913
16,The fisherman's wife went home and gave this message. ,1913,1967
17,"Then the Crab gave her a golden rod, and said, 'Go and strike with this rod three times upon the ground on the place which the King showed you, and to-morrow morning the wall will be there.' ",1967,2158
18,The old woman did so and went away again. ,2158,2200
19,"The next morning, when the King awoke, what do you think he saw? ",2200,2265
20,"The wall stood there before his eyes, exactly as he had bespoken it! ",2265,2334
21,"Then the old woman went back to the King and said to him, 'Your Majesty's orders have been fulfilled.' ",2334,2437
22,"'That is all very well,' said the King, 'but I cannot give away my daughter until there stands in front of my palace a garden in which there are three fountains, of which the first must play gold, the second diamonds, and the third brilliants.' ",2437,2682
23,"So the old woman had to strike again three times upon the ground with the rod, and the next morning the garden was there. ",2682,2804
24,"The King now gave his consent, and the wedding was fixed for the very next day. ",2804,2884
25,"Then the Crab said to the old fisherman, 'Now take this rod; ",2884,2945
26, go and knock with it on a certain mountain; ,2944,2989
27, then a black man will come out and ask you what you wish for. ,2988,3051
28,"Answer him thus: ' 'Your master, the King, has sent me to tell you that you must send him his golden garment that is like the sun.' ",3051,3183
29,"' Make him give you, besides, the queenly robes of gold and precious stones which are like the flowery meadows, and bring them both to me. ",3183,3322
30,And bring me also the golden cushion.' ,3322,3361
31,The old man went and did his errand. ,3361,3398
32,"When he had brought the precious robes, the Crab put on the golden garment and then crept upon the golden cushion, and in this way the fisherman carried him to the castle, where the Crab presented the other garment to his bride. ",3398,3627
33,"Now the ceremony took place, and when the married pair were alone together the Crab made himself known to his young wife, and told her how he was the son of the greatest king in the world, and how he was enchanted, so that he became a crab by day and was a man only at night; ",3627,3903
34, and he could also change himself into an eagle as often as he wished. ,3902,3973
35,"No sooner had he said this than he shook himself, and immediately became a handsome youth, but the next morning he was forced to creep back again into his crab-shell. ",3973,4140
36,And the same thing happened every day. ,4140,4179
37,"But the Princess's affection for the Crab, and the polite attention with which she behaved to him, surprised the royal family very much. ",4179,4316
38,"They suspected some secret, but though they spied and spied, they could not discover it. ",4316,4405
39,"Thus a year passed away, and the Princess had a son, whom she called Benjamin. ",4405,4484
40,But her mother still thought the whole matter very strange. ,4484,4544
41,At last she said to the King that he ought to ask his daughter whether she would not like to have another husband instead of the Crab? ,4544,4679
42,"But when the daughter was questioned she only answered: 'I am married to the Crab, and him only will I have.' ",4679,4789
43,"Then the King said to her, 'I will appoint a tournament in your honour, and I will invite all the princes in the world to it, and if any one of them pleases you, you shall marry him.' ",4789,4973
44,"In the evening the Princess told this to the Crab, who said to her, 'Take this rod, go to the garden gate and knock with it, then a black man will come out and say to you, ' 'Why have you called me, and what do you require of me?' ",4973,5204
45,Answer him thus: 'Your master the King has sent me hither to tell you to send him his golden armour and his steed and the silver apple.' ,5204,5341
46,' And bring them to me.' ,5341,5366
47,"The Princess did so, and brought him what he desired. ",5366,5420
48,The following evening the Prince dressed himself for the tournament. ,5420,5489
49,"Before he went he said to his wife, 'Now mind you do not say when you see me that I am the Crab. ",5489,5586
50,For if you do this evil will come of it. ,5586,5627
51,Place yourself at the window with your sisters; ,5627,5675
52, I will ride by and throw you the silver apple. ,5674,5722
53,"Take it in your hand, but if they ask you who I am, say that you do not know.' ",5722,5801
54,"So saying, he kissed her, repeated his warning once more, and went away. ",5801,5874
55,The Princess went with her sisters to the window and looked on at the tournament. ,5874,5956
56,Presently her husband rode by and threw the apple up to her. ,5956,6017
57,"She caught it in her hand and went with it to her room, and by-and-by her husband came back to her. ",6017,6117
58,But her father was much surprised that she did not seem to care about any of the Princes; ,6117,6207
59, he therefore appointed a second tournament. ,6206,6251
60,"The Crab then gave his wife the same directions as before, only this time the apple which she received from the black man was of gold. ",6251,6386
61,"But before the Prince went to the tournament he said to his wife, 'Now I know you will betray me to-day.' ",6386,6492
62,But she swore to him that she would not tell who he was. ,6492,6549
63,He then repeated his warning and went away. ,6549,6593
64,"In the evening, while the Princess, with her mother and sisters, was standing at the window, the Prince suddenly galloped past on his steed and threw her the golden apple. ",6593,6765
65,"Then her mother flew into a passion, gave her a box on the ear, and cried out, 'Does not even that prince please you, you fool?' ",6765,6894
66,"The Princess in her fright exclaimed, 'That is the Crab himself!' ",6894,6960
67,"Her mother was still more angry because she had not been told sooner, ran into her daughter's room where the crab-shell was still lying, took it up and threw it into the fire. ",6960,7136
68,"Then the poor Princess cried bitterly, but it was of no use; ",7136,7197
69, her husband did not come back. ,7196,7228
70,Now we must leave the Princess and turn to the other persons in the story. ,7228,7303
71,"One day an old man went to a stream to dip in a crust of bread which he was going to eat, when a dog came out of the water, snatched the bread from his hand, and ran away. ",7303,7475
72,"The old man ran after him, but the dog reached a door, pushed it open, and ran in, the old man following him. ",7475,7585
73,"He did not overtake the dog, but found himself above a staircase, which he descended. ",7585,7671
74,"Then he saw before him a stately palace, and, entering, he found in a large hall a table set for twelve persons. ",7671,7784
75,"He hid himself in the hall behind a great picture, that he might see what would happen. ",7784,7872
76,"At noon he heard a great noise, so that he trembled with fear. ",7872,7935
77,"When he took courage to look out from behind the picture, he saw twelve eagles flying in. ",7935,8025
78,At this sight his fear became still greater. ,8025,8070
79,"The eagles flew to the basin of a fountain that was there and bathed themselves, when suddenly they were changed into twelve handsome youths. ",8070,8212
80,"Now they seated themselves at the table, and one of them took up a goblet filled with wine, and said, 'A health to my father!' ",8212,8339
81,"And another said, 'A health to my mother!' ",8339,8382
82,and so the healths went round. ,8382,8413
83,"Then one of them said: 'A health to my dearest lady, Long may she live and well! ",8413,8494
84,But a curse on the cruel mother That burnt my golden shell!' ,8494,8555
85,And so saying he wept bitterly. ,8555,8587
86,"Then the youths rose from the table, went back to the great stone fountain, turned themselves into eagles again, and flew away. ",8587,8715
87,"Then the old man went away too, returned to the light of day, and went home. ",8715,8792
88,"Soon after he heard that the Princess was ill, and that the only thing that did her good was having stories told to her. ",8792,8913
89,"He therefore went to the royal castle, obtained an audience of the Princess, and told her about the strange things he had seen in the underground palace. ",8913,9067
90,No sooner had he finished than the Princess asked him whether he could find the way to that palace. ,9067,9167
91,"'Yes,' he answered, 'certainly.' ",9167,9200
92,And now she desired him to guide her thither at once. ,9200,9254
93,"The old man did so, and when they came to the palace he hid her behind the great picture and advised her to keep quite still, and he placed himself behind the picture also. ",9254,9427
94,"Presently the eagles came flying in, and changed themselves into young men, and in a moment the Princess recognised her husband amongst them all, and tried to come out of her hiding-place; ",9427,9616
95, but the old man held her back. ,9615,9647
96,The youths seated themselves at the table; ,9647,9690
97," and now the Prince said again, while he took up the cup of wine: 'A health to my dearest lady, Long may she live and well! ",9689,9813
98,But a curse on the cruel mother That burnt my golden shell!' ,8494,8555
99,"Then the Princess could restrain herself no longer, but ran forward and threw her arms round her husband. ",9874,9980
100,"And immediately he knew her again, and said: 'Do you remember how I told you that day that you would betray me? ",9980,10092
101,Now you see that I spoke the truth. ,10092,10128
102,But all that bad time is past. ,10128,10159
103,Now listen to me: I must still remain enchanted for three months. ,10159,10225
104,Will you stay here with me till that time is over?' ,10225,10277
105,"So the Princess stayed with him, and said to the old man, 'Go back to the castle and tell my parents that I am staying here.' ",10277,10403
106,"Her parents were very much vexed when the old man came back and told them this, but as soon as the three months of the Prince's enchantment were over, he ceased to be an eagle and became once more a man, and they returned home together. ",10403,10640
107,"And then they lived happily, and we who hear the story are happier still.",10640,10714
