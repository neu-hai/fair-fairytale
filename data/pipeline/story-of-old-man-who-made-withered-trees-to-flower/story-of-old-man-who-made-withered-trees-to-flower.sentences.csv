0,"Long, long ago there lived an old man and his wife who supported themselves by cultivating a small plot of land. ",0,113
1,Their life had been a very happy and peaceful one save for one great sorrow. ,113,190
2,This was they had no child. ,190,218
3,Their only pet was a dog named Shiro. ,218,256
4,On him they lavished all the affection of their old age. ,256,313
5,"Indeed, they loved him so much that whenever they had anything nice to eat they denied themselves to give it to Shiro. ",313,432
6,"Now Shiro means ""white,"" and he was so called because of his color. ",432,500
7,"He was a real Japanese dog, and very like a small wolf in appearance. ",500,570
8,The happiest hour of the day both for the old man and his dog was when the man returned from his work in the field. ,570,686
9,"Having finished his frugal supper of rice and vegetables, he would take what he had saved from the meal out to the little veranda that ran round the cottage. ",686,844
10,"Sure enough, Shiro was waiting for his master and the evening tit-bit. ",844,915
11,"Then the old man said ""Chin, chin!"" ",915,951
12,"and Shiro sat up and begged, and his master gave him the food. ",951,1014
13,Next door to this good old couple there lived another old man and his wife who were both wicked and cruel. ,1014,1121
14,They hated their good neighbors and the dog Shiro with all their might. ,1121,1193
15,"Whenever Shiro happened to look into their kitchen they at once kicked him or threw something at him, sometimes even wounding him. ",1193,1324
16,One day Shiro was heard barking for a long time in the field at the back of his master's house. ,1324,1420
17,"The old man, thinking that perhaps some birds were attacking the corn, hurried out to see what was the matter. ",1420,1531
18,"As soon as Shiro saw his master he ran to meet him, wagging his tail. ",1531,1601
19,"Seizing the end of his kimono, he dragged him under a large yenoki tree. ",1601,1674
20,"Here he began to dig very industriously with his paws, yelping with joy all the time. ",1674,1760
21,"The old man, unable to understand what it all meant, stood looking on in bewilderment. ",1760,1847
22,But Shiro went on barking and digging with all his might. ,1847,1905
23,"The thought that something might be hidden beneath the tree, and that the dog had scented it, at last struck the old man. ",1905,2027
24,"He ran back to the house, fetched his spade and began to dig the ground at that spot. ",2027,2113
25,"What was his astonishment when, after digging for some time, he came upon a heap of old and valuable coins. ",2113,2221
26,The deeper he dug the more gold coins did he find. ,2221,2272
27,So intent was the old man on his work that he never saw the cross face of his neighbor peering at him through the bamboo hedge. ,2272,2400
28,At last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground. ,2400,2454
29,"Shiro sat by erect with pride and looking fondly at his master as if to say, ""You see, though only a dog, I can make some return for all the kindness you show me."" ",2454,2618
30,"The old man ran in to call his wife, and together they carried home the treasure. ",2618,2700
31,Thus in one day the poor old man became rich. ,2700,2746
32,His gratitude to the faithful dog knew no bounds. ,2746,2796
33,"He loved and petted him more than ever, if that were possible. ",2796,2859
34,"The cross old neighbor, attracted by Shiro's barking, had been an unseen and envious witness of the finding of the treasure. ",2859,2984
35,"He began to think that he, too, would like to find a fortune. ",2984,3046
36,So a few days later he called at the old man's house and very ceremoniously asked permission to borrow Shiro for a short time. ,3046,3173
37,"Shiro's master thought this a strange request, because he knew quite well that not only did his neighbor not love his pet dog. ",3173,3300
38,He never lost an opportunity of striking and tormenting him whenever the dog crossed his path. ,3300,3395
39,"But the good old man was too kind-hearted to refuse his neighbor, so he consented to lend the dog on condition that he should be taken great care of. ",3395,3545
40,The wicked old man returned to his home with an evil smile on his face. ,3545,3617
41,He told his wife how he had succeeded in his crafty intentions. ,3617,3681
42,"He then took his spade and hastened to his own field, forcing the unwilling Shiro to follow him. ",3681,3778
43,"As soon as he reached a yenoki tree, he said to the dog, threateningly: ""If there were gold coins under your master's tree, there must also be gold coins under my tree. ",3778,3947
44,You must find them for me! ,3947,3974
45,Where are they? ,3974,3990
46,Where? ,3990,3997
47,"Where?"" ",3997,4005
48,"And catching hold of Shiro's neck he held the dog's head to the ground, so that Shiro began to scratch and dig in order to free himself from the horrid old man's grasp. ",4005,4174
49,The old man was very pleased when he saw the dog begin to scratch and dig. ,4174,4249
50,"He at once supposed that some gold coins lay buried under his tree as well as under his neighbor's, and that the dog had scented them as before. ",4249,4394
51,"Pushing Shiro away he began to dig himself, but there was nothing to be found. ",4394,4473
52,"As he went on digging a foul smell was noticeable, and he at last came upon a refuse heap. ",4473,4564
53,The old man's disgust can be imagined. ,4564,4603
54,This soon gave way to anger. ,4603,4632
55,"He had seen his neighbor's good fortune, and hoping for the same luck himself, he had borrowed the dog Shiro. ",4632,4742
56,"Now, just as he seemed on the point of finding what he sought, only a horrid smelling refuse heap had rewarded him for a morning's digging. ",4742,4882
57,"Instead of blaming his own greed for his disappointment, he blamed the poor dog. ",4882,4963
58,"He seized his spade, and with all his strength struck Shiro and killed him on the spot. ",4963,5051
59,"He then threw the dog's body into the hole which he had dug in the hope of finding a treasure of gold coins, and covered it over with the earth. ",5051,5196
60,"Then he returned to the house, telling no one, not even his wife, what he had done. ",5196,5280
61,"After waiting several days, as the dog Shiro did not return, his master began to grow anxious. ",5280,5375
62,Day after day went by and the good old man waited in vain. ,5375,5434
63,Then he went to his neighbor and asked him to give him back his dog. ,5434,5503
64,"Without any shame or hesitation, the wicked neighbor answered that he had killed Shiro because of his bad behavior. ",5503,5619
65,At this dreadful news Shiro's master wept many sad and bitter tears. ,5619,5688
66,"Great indeed, was his woful surprise, but he was too good and gentle to reproach his bad neighbor. ",5688,5787
67,"Learning that Shiro was buried under the yenoki tree in the field, he asked the old man to give him the tree, in remembrance of his poor dog Shiro. ",5787,5935
68,"Even the cross old neighbor could not refuse such a simple request, so he consented to give the old man the tree under which Shiro lay buried. ",5935,6078
69,Shiro's master then cut the tree down and carried it home. ,6078,6137
70,Out of the trunk he made a mortar. ,6137,6172
71,"In this his wife put some rice, and he began to pound it with the intention of making a festival to the memory of his dog Shiro. ",6172,6301
72,A strange thing happened! ,6301,6327
73,"His wife put the rice into the mortar, and no sooner had he begun to pound it to make the cakes, than it began to increase in quantity gradually till it was about five times the original amount. ",6327,6522
74,The cakes were turned out of the mortar as if an invisible hand were at work. ,6522,6600
75,"When the old man and his wife saw this, they understood that it was a reward to them from Shiro for their faithful love to him. ",6600,6728
76,They tasted the cakes and found them nicer than any other food. ,6728,6792
77,So from this time they never troubled about food. ,6792,6842
78,They lived upon the cakes with which the mortar never ceased to supply them. ,6842,6919
79,"The greedy neighbor, hearing of this new piece of good luck, was filled with envy as before. ",6919,7012
80,"He called on the old man and asked leave to borrow the wonderful mortar for a short time, pretending that he, too, sorrowed for the death of Shiro, and wished to make cakes for a festival to the dog's memory. ",7012,7221
81,"The old man did not in the least wish to lend it to his cruel neighbor, but he was too kind to refuse. ",7221,7324
82,"So the envious man carried home the mortar, but he never brought it back. ",7324,7398
83,"Several days passed, and Shiro's master waited in vain for the mortar, so he went to call on the borrower. ",7398,7505
84,He asked him to be good enough to return the mortar if he had finished with it. ,7505,7585
85,He found him sitting by a big fire made of pieces of wood. ,7585,7644
86,On the ground lay what looked very much like pieces of a broken mortar. ,7644,7716
87,"In answer to the old man's inquiry, the wicked neighbor answered haughtily: ""Have you come to ask me for your mortar? ",7716,7834
88,"I broke it to pieces, and now I am making a fire of the wood. ",7834,7896
89,"When I tried to pound cakes in it only some horrid smelling stuff came out."" ",7896,7973
90,"The good old man said: ""I am very sorry for that. ",7973,8023
91,It is a great pity you did not ask me for the cakes if you wanted them. ,8023,8095
92,I would have given you as many as ever you wanted. ,8095,8146
93,"Now please give me the ashes of the mortar, as I wish to keep them in remembrance of my dog."" ",8146,8240
94,"The neighbor consented at once, and the old man carried home a basket full of ashes. ",8240,8325
95,Not long after this the old man accidentally scattered some of the ashes made by the burning of the mortar on the trees of his garden. ,8325,8460
96,A wonderful thing happened! ,8460,8488
97,"It was late in autumn and all the trees had shed their leaves, but no sooner did the ashes touch their branches than the cherry trees, the plum trees, and all other blossoming shrubs burst into bloom. ",8488,8689
98,The old man's garden was suddenly transformed into a beautiful picture of spring. ,8689,8771
99,"The old man's delight knew no bounds, and he carefully preserved the remaining ashes. ",8771,8857
100,"The story of the old man's garden spread far and wide, and people from far and near came to see the wonderful sight. ",8857,8974
101,"One day, soon after this, the old man heard some one knocking at his door. ",8974,9049
102,Going to the porch to see who it was he was surprised to see a Knight standing there. ,9049,9135
103,This Knight told him that he was a retainer of a great Daimio (Earl). ,9135,9205
104,One of the favorite cherry trees in this nobleman's garden had withered. ,9205,9278
105,"Though every one in his service had tried all manner of means to revive it, none took effect. ",9278,9372
106,The Knight was sore perplexed when he saw what great displeasure the loss of his favorite cherry tree caused the Daimio. ,9372,9493
107,"At this point, fortunately, they had heard that there was a wonderful old man who could make withered trees to blossom. ",9493,9613
108,His Lord had sent him to ask the old man to come to him. ,9613,9670
109,"""And,"" added the Knight, ""I shall be very much obliged if you will come at once."" ",9670,9752
110,"The good old man was greatly surprised at what he heard, but respectfully followed the Knight to the nobleman's Palace. ",9752,9872
111,"The Daimio, who had been impatiently awaiting the old man's coming, as soon as he saw him asked him at once: ""Are you the old man who can make withered trees flower even out of season?"" ",9872,10058
112,"The old man made an obeisance, and replied: ""I am that old man!"" ",10058,10123
113,"Then the Daimio said: ""You must make that dead cherry tree in my garden blossom again by means of your famous ashes. ",10123,10240
114,"I shall look on."" ",10240,10258
115,"Then they all went into the garden-the Daimio and his retainers and the ladies-in waiting, who carried the Daimio's sword. ",10258,10381
116,The old man now tucked up his kimono and made ready to climb the tree. ,10381,10452
117,"Saying ""Excuse me,"" he took the pot of ashes which he had brought with him, and began to climb the tree. ",10452,10557
118,Every one watched his movements with great interest. ,10557,10610
119,At last he climbed to the spot where the tree divided into two great branches. ,10610,10689
120,"Taking up his position here, the old man sat down and scattered the ashes right and left all over the branches and twigs. ",10689,10811
121,"Wonderful, indeed, was the result! ",10811,10846
122,The withered tree at once burst into full bloom! ,10846,10895
123,The Daimio was so transported with joy that he looked as if he would go mad. ,10895,10972
124,"He rose to his feet and spread out his fan, calling the old man down from the tree. ",10972,11056
125,"He himself gave the old man a wine cup filled with the best SAKE, and rewarded him with much silver and gold and many other precious things. ",11056,11197
126,"The Daimio ordered that henceforth the old man should call himself by the name of Hana-Saka-Jijii, or ""The Old Man who makes the Trees to Blossom."" ",11197,11345
127,Henceforth all were to recognize him by this name. ,11345,11396
128,He sent him home with great honor. ,11396,11431
129,"The wicked neighbor, as before, heard of the good old man's fortune, and of all that had so auspiciously befallen him. ",11431,11550
130,He could not suppress all the envy and jealousy that filled his heart. ,11550,11621
131,"He called to mind how he had failed in his attempt to find the gold coins, and then in making the magic cakes. ",11621,11732
132,"This time surely he must succeed if he imitated the old man, who made withered trees to flower simply by sprinkling ashes on them. ",11732,11863
133,This would be the simplest task of all. ,11863,11903
134,So he set to work and gathered together all the ashes which remained in the fire-place from the burning of the wonderful mortar. ,11903,12032
135,"Then he set out in the hope of finding some great man to employ him, calling out loudly as he went along: ""Here comes the wonderful man who can make withered trees blossom! ",12032,12205
136,"Here comes the old man who can make dead trees blossom!"" ",12205,12262
137,"The Daimio in his Palace heard this cry, and said: ""That must be the Hana-Saka-Jijii passing. ",12262,12356
138,I have nothing to do to-day. ,12356,12385
139,Let him try his art again. ,12385,12412
140,"It will amuse me to look on."" ",12412,12442
141,So the retainers went out and brought in the impostor before their Lord. ,12442,12515
142,The satisfaction of false old man can now be imagined. ,12515,12570
143,"But the Daimio looking at him, thought it strange that he was not at all like the old man he had seen before, so he asked him: ""Are you the man whom I named Hana-Saka-Jijii?"" ",12570,12745
144,"And the envious neighbor answered with a lie: ""Yes, my Lord!"" ",12745,12807
145,"""That is strange!"" ",12807,12826
146,said the Daimio. ,12826,12843
147,"""I thought there was only one Hana-Saka-Jijii in the world! ",12843,12903
148,"Has he now some disciples?"" ",12903,12931
149,"""I am the true Hana-Saka-Jijii. ",12931,12963
150,"The one who came to you before was only my disciple!"" ",12963,13017
151,replied the old man again. ,13017,13044
152,"""Then you must be more skillful than the other. ",13044,13092
153,"Try what you can do and let me see!"" ",13092,13129
154,"The envious neighbor, with the Daimio and his Court following, then went into the garden. ",13129,13219
155,"Approaching a dead tree, he took out a handful of the ashes which he carried with him, and scattered them over the tree. ",13219,13340
156,"But not only did the tree not burst into flower, but not even a bud came forth. ",13340,13420
157,"Thinking that he had not used enough ashes, the old man took handfuls and again sprinkled them over the withered tree. ",13420,13539
158,But all to no effect. ,13539,13561
159,"After trying several times, the ashes were blown into the Daimio's eyes. ",13561,13634
160,This made him very angry. ,13634,13660
161,He ordered his retainers to arrest the false Hana-Saka-Jijii at once and put him in prison for an impostor. ,13660,13768
162,From this imprisonment the wicked old man was never freed. ,13768,13827
163,Thus did he meet with punishment at last for all his evil doings. ,13827,13893
164,"The good old man, however, with the treasure of gold coins which Shiro had found for him, and with all the gold and the silver which the Daimio had showered on him, became a rich and prosperous man in his old age, and lived a long and happy life, beloved and respected by all.",13893,14170
