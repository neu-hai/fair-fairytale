0,"Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. ",0,106
1,"It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. ",106,159
2,"Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. ",159,370
3,The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them. ,370,488
4,"""How happy we are here!"" ",488,513
5,they cried to each other. ,513,539
6,One day the Giant came back. ,539,568
7,"He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. ",568,659
8,"After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. ",659,808
9,When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden. ,808,867
10,"""What are you doing here?"" ",867,894
11,"he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away. ",894,953
12,"""My own garden is my own garden,"" said the Giant; ",953,1003
13," ""any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself."" ",1002,1084
14,"So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board. ",1084,1149
15,He was a very selfish Giant. ,1149,1178
16,The poor children had now nowhere to play. ,1178,1221
17,"They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. ",1221,1332
18,"They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. ",1332,1446
19,"""How happy we were there,"" they said to each other. ",1446,1498
20,"Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. ",1498,1590
21,Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. ,1590,1651
22,"The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. ",1651,1748
23,"Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. ",1748,1938
24,The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. ,1938,2000
25,"""Spring has forgotten this garden,"" they cried, ""so we will live here all the year round."" ",2000,2091
26,"The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. ",2091,2193
27,"Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. ",2193,2258
28,"He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. ",2258,2354
29,"""This is a delightful spot,"" he said, ""we must ask the Hail on a visit."" ",2354,2427
30,So the Hail came. ,2427,2445
31,"Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. ",2445,2609
32,"He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice. ",2609,2662
33,"""I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,"" said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; ",2662,2810
34," ""I hope there will be a change in the weather."" ",2809,2858
35,"But the Spring never came, nor the Summer.The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none. ",2858,2987
36,"""He is too selfish,"" she said. ",2987,3018
37,"So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees. ",3018,3143
38,One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. ,3143,3221
39,It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by. ,3221,3313
40,"It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. ",3313,3507
41,"Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. ",3507,3650
42,"""I believe the Spring has come at last,"" said the Giant; ",3650,3707
43, and he jumped out of bed and looked out. ,3706,3748
44,What did he see? ,3748,3765
45,He saw a most wonderful sight. ,3765,3796
46,"Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. ",3796,3909
47,In every tree that he could see there was a little child. ,3909,3967
48,"And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. ",3967,4136
49,"The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. ",4136,4263
50,"It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter. ",4263,4326
51,"It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. ",4326,4405
52,"He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. ",4405,4529
53,"The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. ",4529,4641
54,"""Climb up! ",4641,4652
55,"little boy,"" said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; ",4652,4730
56, but the boy was too tiny. ,4729,4756
57,And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out. ,4756,4803
58,"""How selfish I have been!"" ",4803,4830
59,he said; ,4830,4839
60," ""now I know why the Spring would not come here. ",4838,4887
61,"I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever."" ",4887,5049
62,He was really very sorry for what he had done. ,5049,5096
63,"So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. ",5096,5189
64,"But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. ",5189,5303
65,"Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. ",5303,5409
66,"And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree. ",5409,5506
67,"And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him. ",5506,5683
68,"And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. ",5683,5813
69,"""It is your garden now, little children,"" said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. ",5813,5922
70,And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen. ,5922,6077
71,"All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye. ",6077,6166
72,"""But where is your little companion?"" ",6166,6204
73,"he said: ""the boy I put into the tree."" ",6204,6244
74,The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him. ,6244,6300
75,"""We don't know,"" answered the children; ",6300,6340
76," ""he has gone away."" ",6339,6360
77,"""You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,"" said the Giant. ",6360,6432
78,"But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; ",6432,6524
79, and the Giant felt very sad. ,6523,6553
80,"Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant. ",6553,6637
81,But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again. ,6637,6699
82,"The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him. ",6699,6811
83,"""How I would like to see him!"" ",6811,6842
84,he used to say. ,6842,6858
85,"Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. ",6858,6915
86,"He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden. ",6915,7044
87,"""I have many beautiful flowers,"" he said; ",7044,7086
88," ""but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all."" ",7085,7144
89,One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. ,7144,7211
90,"He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting. ",7211,7328
91,"Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. ",7328,7390
92,It certainly was a marvellous sight. ,7390,7427
93,In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. ,7427,7517
94,"Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved. ",7517,7638
95,"Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. ",7638,7702
96,"He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. ",7702,7760
97,"And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, ""Who hath dared to wound thee?"" ",7760,7864
98,"For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet. ",7864,7985
99,"""Who hath dared to wound thee?"" ",7832,7864
100,cried the Giant; ,8017,8034
101," ""tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."" ",8033,8088
102,"""Nay!"" ",8088,8095
103,answered the child; ,8095,8115
104," ""but these are the wounds of Love."" ",8114,8151
105,"""Who art thou?"" ",8151,8167
106,"said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child. ",8167,8252
107,"And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, ""You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."" ",8252,8406
108,"And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.",8406,8532
