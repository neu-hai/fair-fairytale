0,"Once upon a time there was a peasant boy, who dreamed that he would get a princess, from far, far away, that she was as white as milk, and as red as blood, and so rich that her riches had no end. ",0,196
1,"When he woke, it seemed to him as though she were still standing before him. ",196,273
2,She was so beautiful and winning that he could not go on living without her. ,273,350
3,"So he sold all that he had, and went forth to look for her. ",350,410
4,"He wandered far, and at last, in the winter-time, came into a land where the roads all ran in straight lines, and made no turns. ",410,539
5,"After he had wandered straight ahead for full three months, he came to a city. ",539,618
6,"And there a great block of ice lay before the church door, and in the middle of it was a corpse, and the whole congregation spat at it as the people passed by. ",618,778
7,"This surprised the youth, and when the pastor came out of the church, he asked him what it meant. ",778,876
8,"""He was a great evil-doer,"" replied the pastor, ""who has been executed because of his misdeeds, and has been exposed here in shame and derision."" ",876,1022
9,"""But what did he do?"" ",1022,1044
10,asked the youth. ,1044,1061
11,"""During his mortal life he was a wine-dealer,"" answered the pastor, ""and he watered the wine he sold."" ",1061,1164
12,This did not strike the youth as being such a terrible crime. ,1164,1226
13,"""Even if he had to pay for it with his life,"" said he, ""one might now grant him a Christian burial, and let him rest in peace."" ",1226,1354
14,But the pastor said that this could not be done at all. ,1354,1410
15,People would be needed to break him out of the ice; ,1410,1462
16, and money would be needed to buy a grave for him from the church; ,1461,1528
17, and the gravedigger would want to be paid for his trouble; ,1527,1587
18, and the sexton for tolling the bells; ,1586,1625
19, and the cantor for singing; ,1624,1653
20, and the pastor himself for the funeral sermon. ,1652,1700
21,"""Do you think there is any one who would pay all that money for such an arrant sinner's sake?"" ",1700,1795
22,inquired the pastor. ,1795,1816
23,"""Yes,"" said the youth. ",1816,1839
24,"If he could manage to have him buried, he would be willing to pay for the wake out of his own slender purse. ",1839,1948
25,At first the pastor would hear nothing of it. ,1948,1994
26,"But when the youth returned with two men, and asked him in their presence whether he refused the dead man Christian burial, he ventured no further objections. ",1994,2153
27,"So they released the wine-dealer from his block of ice, and laid him in consecrated ground. ",2153,2245
28,"The bells tolled, and there was singing, and the pastor threw earth on the coffin, and they had a wake at which tears and laughter alternated. ",2245,2388
29,"But when the youth had paid for the wake, he had but a few shillings left in his pocket. ",2388,2477
30,Then he once more set out on his way. ,2477,2515
31,"He had not gone far before a man came up behind him, and asked him whether he did not find it tiresome to wander along all alone. ",2515,2645
32,"""No,"" said the youth, he always had something to think about. ",2645,2707
33,The man asked whether he did not need a servant. ,2707,2756
34,"""No,"" said the youth, ""I am used to serving myself, so I have no need of a servant. ",2756,2840
35,"No matter how much I might wish for one, I still would have to do without, since I have no money for his keep and pay."" ",2840,2960
36,"""Yet you need a servant, as I know better than you do,"" said the man, ""and you need one upon whom you can rely in life and death. ",2960,3090
37,"But if you do not want me for a servant, then let me be your comrade. ",3090,3160
38,"I promise that you will not lose thereby, and I will not cost you a shilling. ",3160,3238
39,"I travel at my own expense, nor need you be put to trouble as regards my food and clothing."" ",3238,3331
40,"Under these circumstances the youth was glad to have him for a comrade, and they resumed their journey, the man as a rule going in advance and pointing out the way. ",3331,3496
41,"After they had wandered long through various lands, over hills and over heaths, they suddenly stood before a wall of rock. ",3496,3619
42,"The comrade knocked, and begged to be let in. ",3619,3665
43,"Then the rock opened before them, and after they had gone quite a way into the interior of the hill, a witch came to meet them and offered them a chair. ",3665,3818
44,"""Be so good as to sit down, for you must be weary!"" ",3818,3870
45,said she. ,3870,3880
46,"""Sit down yourself!"" ",3880,3901
47,answered the man. ,3901,3919
48,"Then she had to sit down and remain seated, for the chair had power to hold fast all that approached it. ",3919,4024
49,"In the meantime they wandered about in the hill, and the comrade kept looking around until he saw a sword that hung above the door. ",4024,4156
50,"This he wanted to have, and he promised the witch that he would release her from her chair if she would let him have the sword. ",4156,4284
51,"""No,"" she cried, ""ask what you will. ",4284,4321
52,"You can have anything else, but not that, for that is my Three-Sisters Sword!"" ",4321,4400
53,(There were three sisters to whom the sword belonged in common.) ,4400,4465
54,"""Then you may sit where you are till the world's end!"" ",4465,4520
55,said the man. ,4520,4534
56,"And when she heard that she promised to let him have the sword, if he would release her. ",4534,4623
57,"So he took the sword, and went away with it; ",4623,4668
58," but he left her sitting there, after all. ",4667,4710
59,"When they had wandered far, over stony wastes and desolate heaths, they again came to a wall of rock. ",4710,4812
60,"There the comrade again knocked, and begged to be let in. ",4812,4870
61,"Just as before, the rock opened, and when they had gone far into the hill, a witch came to meet them with a chair and bade them be seated, ""for you must be tired,"" said she. ",4870,5044
62,"""Sit down yourself!"" ",3880,3901
63,said the comrade. ,5065,5083
64,"And what had happened to her sister happened to her, she had to seat herself, and could not get up again. ",5083,5189
65,"In the meantime the youth and his comrade went about in the hill, and the latter opened all the closets and drawers, until he found what he had been searching for, a ball of golden twine. ",5189,5377
66,"This he wished to have, and promised he would release her from the chair if she would give it to him. ",5377,5479
67,She told him he might have all she possessed; ,5479,5525
68," but that she could not give him the ball, since it was her Three-Sisters Ball. ",5524,5604
69,"But when she heard that she would have to sit in the chair till the Day of Judgment, she changed her mind. ",5604,5711
70,"Then the comrade took the ball, and in spite of it left her sitting where she was. ",5711,5794
71,"Then they wandered for many a day through wood and heath, until they came to a wall of rock. ",5794,5887
72,"All happened as it had twice before, the comrade knocked, the hill opened, and inside a witch came to meet them with a chair, and bade them sit down. ",5887,6037
73,The two had gone through many rooms before the comrade spied an old hat hanging on a hook behind the door. ,6037,6144
74,"The hat he must have, but the old witch would not part with it, since it was her Three-Sisters Hat, and if she gave it away she would be thoroughly unhappy. ",6144,6301
75,"But when she heard that she would have to sit there until the Day of Judgment if she did not give up the hat, she at last agreed to do so. ",6301,6440
76,"The comrade took the hat, and then told her to keep on sitting where she sat, like her sisters. ",6440,6536
77,At length they came to a river. ,6536,6568
78,There the comrade took the ball of golden twine and flung it against the hill on the other side of the river with such force that it bounded back. ,6568,6715
79,"And when it had flown back and forth several times, there stood a bridge, and when they had reached the other side, the comrade told the youth to wind up the golden twine again as swiftly as possible, ""for if we do not take it away quickly, the three witches will cross and tear us to pieces."" ",6715,7009
80,The youth wound as quickly as he could. ,7009,7049
81,"Just as he was at the last thread, the witches rushed up, hissing, flung themselves into the water so that the foam splashed high, and snatched at the end of the thread. ",7049,7219
82,"But they could not grasp it, and drowned in the river. ",7219,7274
83,"After they had again wandered on for a few days, the comrade said: ""Now we will soon reach the castle in which she lives, the princess of whom you dreamed, and when we reach it, you must go to the castle and tell the king what you dreamed, and your journey's aim."" ",7274,7539
84,"When they got there, the youth did as he was told, and was very well received. ",7539,7618
85,"He was given a room for himself, and one for his servant, and when it was time to eat, he was invited to the king's own table. ",7618,7745
86,"When he saw the princess, he recognized her at once as the vision of his dream. ",7745,7825
87,"He told her, too, why he was there, and she replied that she liked him quite well, and would gladly take him, but first he must undergo three tests. ",7825,7974
88,"When they had eaten, she gave him a pair of gold shears and said: ""The first test is that you take these shears and keep them, and give them back to me to-morrow noon. ",7974,8142
89,"That is not a very severe test,"" she said, and smiled, ""but, if you cannot stand it, you must die, as the law demands, and you will be in the same case as the suitors whose bones you may see lying without the castle gate."" ",8142,8365
90,"""That is no great feat,"" thought the youth to himself. ",8365,8420
91,"But the princess was so merry and active, and so full of fun and nonsense, that he thought neither of the shears nor of himself. ",8420,8549
92,"While they were laughing and joking, she secretly robbed him of the shears without his noticing it. ",8549,8649
93,"When he came to his room in the evening, and told what had occurred, and what the princess had said to him, and about the shears which she had given him to guard, his comrade asked: ""And have you still the shears?"" ",8649,8864
94,The youth looked through all his pockets; ,8864,8906
95," but his shears were not there, and he was more than unhappy when he realized that he had lost them. ",8905,9006
96,"""Well, well, never mind. ",9006,9031
97,"I will see whether I can get them back for you,"" said his comrade, and went down into the stable. ",9031,9129
98,"There stood an enormous goat which belonged to the princess, and could fly through the air more swiftly than he could walk on level ground. ",9129,9269
99,"The comrade took the Three-Sisters Sword, gave him a blow between the horns, and asked: ""At what time does the princess ride to meet her lover to-night?"" ",9269,9423
100,"The goat bleated, and said he did not dare tell. ",9423,9472
101,"When the comrade had given him another thump, he did say that the princess would come at eleven o'clock sharp. ",9472,9583
102,"Then the comrade put on the Three-Sisters Hat, which made him invisible, and waited for the princess. ",9583,9685
103,"When she came, she anointed the goat with a salve she carried in a great horn, and cried out: ""Up, up! ",9685,9788
104,"over gable and roof, over land and sea, over hill and dale, to my dearest, who waits for me in the hill!"" ",9788,9894
105,"As the goat flew upward, the comrade swung himself up in back, and then they were off like the wind through the clouds: it was not a long journey. ",9894,10041
106,"Suddenly they stood before a wall of rock, she knocked, and then they took their way into the interior of the hill, to the troll who was her dearest. ",10041,10191
107,"""And now a new suitor has come who wants to win me, sweetheart,"" said she. ",10191,10266
108,"""He is young and handsome, but I will have none but you,"" she went on, and made a great time over the troll. ",10266,10375
109,"""I have set him a test, and here are the shears that he was to keep and guard. ",10375,10454
110,"You shall keep them now!"" ",10454,10480
111,Then both of them laughed as though the youth had already lost his head. ,10480,10553
112,"""Yes, I will keep them, and take good care of them, and a kiss from you shall pledge the truth, when crows are cawing around the youth!"" ",10553,10690
113,said the troll. ,10690,10706
114,He laid the shears in an iron chest with three locks. ,10706,10760
115,"But at the moment he was dropping the shears into the chest, the comrade caught them up. ",10760,10849
116,"None could see him, for he was wearing the Three-Sisters Hat. ",10849,10911
117,"So the troll carefully locked the empty chest, and put the key into a hollow double-tooth, where he kept other magic things. ",10911,11036
118,"""The suitor could hardly find it there,"" said he. ",11036,11086
119,After midnight the princess set out for home. ,11086,11132
120,"The comrade swung himself up in back again, and the trip home did not take long. ",11132,11213
121,The following noon the youth was invited to dine at the king's table. ,11213,11283
122,"But this time the princess kept her nose in the air, and was so haughty and snappish that she hardly condescended to glance in the youth's direction. ",11283,11433
123,"But after they had eaten, she looked very solemn, and asked in the sweetest manner: ""You probably still have the shears I gave you to take care of yesterday?"" ",11433,11592
124,"""Yes, here they are,"" said the youth; ",11592,11630
125, and he flung them on the table so that they rang. ,11629,11680
126,The princess could not have been more frightened had he thrown the shears in her face. ,11680,11767
127,"But she tried to make the best of a bad bargain, and said in a sweet voice: ""Since you have taken such good care of the shears, you will not find it hard to keep my ball of gold twine for me. ",11767,11959
128,I should like to have it back by to-morrow noon. ,11959,12008
129,"But if you cannot give it to me then, you must die, according to the law."" ",12008,12083
130,"The youth thought it would not be so very hard, and put the ball of gold twine in his pocket. ",12083,12177
131,"Yet the princess once more began to toy and joke with him, so that he thought neither of himself nor of the ball of gold twine, and while they were in the midst of their merry play she stole the golden ball from him, and then dismissed him. ",12177,12418
132,"When he came up into his room, and told what she had said and done, his comrade asked: ""And have you still the ball of gold twine?"" ",12418,12550
133,"""Yes, indeed,"" said the youth, and thrust his hand into the pocket in which he had placed it. ",12550,12644
134,"But there was no ball in it, and he fell into such despair that he did not know what to do. ",12644,12736
135,"""Do not worry,"" said his comrade. ",12736,12770
136,"""I will see whether I cannot get it back for you."" ",12770,12821
137,"He took his sword and his hat, and went to a smith and had him weld twelve extra pounds of iron to his sword. ",12821,12931
138,"Then, when he entered the stable, he gave the goat such a blow between the horns with it that he staggered, and asked: ""At what time does the princess ride to her dearest to-night?"" ",12931,13113
139,"""At twelve o'clock sharp,"" said the goat. ",13113,13155
140,"The comrade once more put on his Three-Sisters Hat, and waited until the princess came with the horn of ointment and anointed the goat. ",13155,13291
141,"Then she repeated what she had already said: ""Up, up! ",13291,13345
142,"over gable and tower, over land and sea, over hill and dale, to my dearest who waits for me in the hill!"" ",13345,13451
143,"And when the goat arose, the comrade swung himself up in back, and off they were like lightning through the air. ",13451,13564
144,"Soon they had reached the troll-hill, and when she had knocked thrice they passed through the interior of the hill till they met the troll who was her dearest. ",13564,13724
145,"""What manner of care did you take of the golden shears I gave you yesterday, my friend?"" ",13724,13813
146,asked the princess. ,13813,13833
147,"""The suitor had them, and he gave them back to me."" ",13833,13885
148,"That was quite impossible, said the troll, for he had locked them up in a chest with three locks, and had thrust the key into his hollow tooth. ",13885,14029
149,"But when they had unlocked the chest and looked, there were no shears there. ",14029,14106
150,Then the princess told him that she had now given him her ball of golden twine. ,14106,14186
151,"""Here it is,"" said she. ",14186,14210
152,"""I took it away from him again without his having noticed it; ",14210,14272
153," but what are we to do if he is a master of such arts?"" ",14271,14327
154,The troll could not think of anything to suggest. ,14327,14377
155,"After they had reflected a while they hit on the idea of lighting a great fire, and burning the ball of gold twine, for then the suitor could surely not regain it. ",14377,14541
156,"Yet when she threw it into the flames, the comrade leaped forward and caught it, without being seen, for he was wearing the Three-Sisters Hat. ",14541,14684
157,"After the princess had stayed a little while she returned home, and again the comrade sat up behind, and the trip home was swiftly and safely made. ",14684,14832
158,"When the youth was asked to the king's table, the comrade gave him the ball. ",14832,14909
159,"The princess was still more sharp and disdainful in her remarks than before, and after they had eaten she pinched her lips, and said: ""Would it not be possible for me to get my ball of gold twine again, which I gave you yesterday?"" ",14909,15141
160,"""Yes,"" said the youth, ""you can have it; ",15141,15182
161," there it is!"" ",15181,15196
162,and he flung it on the table with such a thud that the king leaped up in the air with fright. ,15196,15290
163,The princess grew as pale as a corpse. ,15290,15329
164,"She made the best of a bad bargain, and said that he had done well. ",15329,15397
165,Now there was only one more little test for him to undergo. ,15397,15457
166,"""If you can bring me what I am thinking about by to-morrow noon, then you may have me and keep me."" ",15457,15557
167,The youth felt as though he had been condemned to death. ,15557,15614
168,"It seemed altogether impossible for him to know of what the princess was thinking, and still more impossible to bring her the thing in question. ",15614,15759
169,And when he came to his room his comrade could scarcely quiet him. ,15759,15826
170,"He said he would take the matter in hand, as he had done on the other occasions, and at last the youth grew calmer, and lay down to sleep. ",15826,15965
171,"In the meantime the comrade went to the smith, and had him weld an additional twenty-four pounds of iron on his sword. ",15965,16084
172,"When this had been done, he went to the stable, and gave the goat such a smashing blow between the horns that he flew to the other side of the wall. ",16084,16233
173,"""At what time does the princess ride to her dearest to-night?"" ",13050,13113
174,said he. ,11077,11086
175,"""At one o'clock sharp,"" bleated the goat. ",16305,16347
176,"When the time came, the comrade was standing in the stable, wearing his Three-Sisters Hat, and after the princess had anointed the goat and spoken her formula, off they went through the air as before, with the comrade sitting in back. ",16347,16582
177,"But this time he was anything but gentle, and kept giving the princess a cuff here, and a cuff there, until she had received a terrible drubbing. ",16582,16728
178,"When she reached the wall of rock, she knocked three times, the hill opened, and they flew through it to her dearest. ",16728,16846
179,"She complained bitterly to him, and said she would never have thought it possible that the weather could affect one so. ",16846,16966
180,"It had seemed to her as though some one were flying along with them, beating her and the goat, and her whole body must be covered with black and blue spots, so badly had she been thrashed. ",16966,17155
181,And then she told how the suitor had again had the ball of twine. ,17155,17221
182,"How he had managed to get it, neither she nor the troll could guess. ",17221,17290
183,"""But do you know the thought that came to me?"" ",17290,17337
184,said she. ,3870,3880
185,Of course the troll did not. ,17347,17376
186,"""Well,"" said she, ""I have told him he is to bring me the thing I am thinking of by to-morrow noon, and that thing is your head. ",17376,17504
187,"Do you think, dear friend, that he will be able to bring it to me?"" ",17504,17572
188,and she made a great time over the troll. ,17572,17614
189,"""I do not think he can,"" said the troll, who felt quite sure of himself, and laughed and chortled with pleasure in the most malicious way. ",17614,17753
190,"For he and the princess were firmly convinced that the youth would be more apt to lose his own head, and be left to the ravens, than that he would be able to bring the princess the head of the troll. ",17753,17953
191,"Toward morning the princess wanted to fly home again, but she did not venture to ride alone; ",17953,18046
192, the troll must accompany her. ,18045,18076
193,"He was quite ready to do so, took his goat from the stable--he had one just like that of the princess--and anointed him between the horns. ",18076,18215
194,"When the troll had mounted, the comrade swung up in back of him, and off they were through the air in the direction of the king's castle. ",18215,18353
195,"But on the way the comrade beat away lustily at the troll and his goat, and gave him thump after thump, and blow after blow with his sword, until they were flying lower and lower, and at last nearly fell into the sea across which their journey led them. ",18353,18607
196,"When the troll noticed how stormy the weather was, he accompanied the princess to the castle, and waited outside to make sure that she really came home safely. ",18607,18767
197,"But the moment when the door closed on the princess, the comrade hewed off his head, and went up with it to the youth's room. ",18767,18893
198,"""Here is the thing of which the princess was thinking,"" said he. ",18893,18958
199,"Then everything was in apple-pie order, and when the youth was invited to the king's table and they had eaten, the princess grew as merry as a lark. ",18958,19107
200,"""Have you, perhaps, the thing of which I was thinking?"" ",19107,19163
201,"""To be sure,"" said the youth, and he drew forth the head from beneath his coat, and flung it on the table so that the table and all that was on it fell over. ",19163,19321
202,The princess looked as though she had come from the grave. ,19321,19380
203,"Yet she could not deny that this was the thing of which she had thought, and now she had to take the youth, as she had promised. ",19380,19509
204,"So the wedding was celebrated, and there was great joy throughout the kingdom. ",19509,19588
205,"But the comrade took the youth aside, and said that on their wedding-night he might close his eyes and pretend to sleep. ",19588,19709
206,"If he loved his life, and followed his advice, he would not sleep a wink until the princess was freed from her troll-skin. ",19709,19832
207,"He must whip it off with nine new switches of birch-wood, and strip it off with three milk-baths beside. ",19832,19937
208,"First he must scrub it off in a tub of year-old whey, then he must rub it off in a tub of sour milk, and finally, he must sponge it off in a tub of sweet milk. ",19937,20097
209,"He had laid the birch switches beneath the bed, and had stood the tubs of milk in the corner; ",20097,20191
210, all was prepared. ,20190,20209
211,"The youth promised to follow his advice, and do as he had told him. ",20209,20277
212,"When night came, and he lay in his bed, the princess raised herself on her elbows, to see if he were really asleep, and she tickled him under the nose; ",20277,20429
213, but he was sleeping quite soundly. ,20428,20464
214,Then she pulled his hair and his beard. ,20464,20504
215,But it seemed to her that he slept like a log. ,20504,20551
216,"Then she drew a great butcher's knife out from beneath her pillow, and wanted to cut off his head. ",20551,20650
217,"But the youth leaped up, struck the knife from her hand, seized her by the hair, whipped her with the switches, and did not stop until not one was left. ",20650,20803
218,"Thereupon he threw her into the tub of whey, and then he saw what sort of creature she really was, for her whole body was coal-black. ",20803,20937
219,"But when he had scrubbed her in the whey, and rubbed her in the sour milk, and sponged her in the sweet milk, the troll-skin had altogether disappeared, and she was lovelier than she had ever been before. ",20937,21142
220,On the following day the comrade said that now they must get on their way. ,21142,21217
221,"The youth was ready to set forth, and the princess, too, for her dower had long since been made ready. ",21217,21320
222,"During the night the comrade had brought all the gold and silver, and all the valuables which the troll had left in the hill to the castle. ",21320,21460
223,"When they wanted to start in the morning, the castle court-yard was so full they could scarcely get through. ",21460,21569
224,"The dower supplied by the troll was worth more than the king's whole country, and they did not know how they were to take it home. ",21569,21700
225,But the comrade found a way out of the difficulty. ,21700,21751
226,The troll had also left six goats who could fly through the air. ,21751,21816
227,"These he loaded so heavily with gold and silver that they had to walk on the ground, and were not strong enough to rise into the air. ",21816,21950
228,"What the goats could not carry, had to be left at the castle. ",21950,22012
229,"Thus they traveled for a long time, but at last the goats grew so weary and wretched that they could go no further. ",22012,22128
230,The youth and the princess did not know what to do. ,22128,22180
231,"When the comrade saw that they could not move from the spot, he took the whole treasure on his back, topped it with the goats, and carried it all until they were no more than half a mile from the youth's home. ",22180,22390
232,"Then the comrade said: ""Now I must part from you, for I can stay with you no longer."" ",22390,22476
233,"But the youth would not hear of parting, and would not let him go at any price. ",22476,22556
234,"So he went along another half mile, but further than that he could not go. ",22556,22631
235,"When the youth pressed him, and insisted that he come home with him, and stay there; ",22631,22716
236," or that he at least celebrate their home-coming, he merely said no, he could not do so. ",22715,22804
237,Then the youth asked him what he wished in the way of payment for his company and aid. ,22804,22891
238,"""If I am to wish for something, then I would like to have half of all that you may gain in the course of the next five years,"" said his comrade. ",22891,23036
239,And this was promised him. ,23036,23063
240,"Now when the comrade had gone, the youth hid all his treasure, and went straight home. ",23063,23150
241,And there they celebrated a home-coming feast that was talked about in seven kingdoms. ,23150,23237
242,"When that was over they spent the whole winter going back and forth with the goats, and his father's twelve horses, bringing all the gold and silver home. ",23237,23392
243,After five years the comrade came again and asked for his share. ,23392,23457
244,Then the man divided all his possessions into two equal parts. ,23457,23520
245,"""Yet there is one thing you have not divided,"" said the comrade. ",23520,23585
246,"""What could that be?"" ",23585,23607
247,asked the man. ,23607,23622
248,"""I thought I had divided everything."" ",23622,23660
249,"""You have been blessed with a child,"" said the comrade, ""and that you must also divide into two equal parts."" ",23660,23770
250,"Yes, such was really the case. ",23770,23801
251,"Then he took up his sword, but when he raised it and was about to divide the child, his comrade seized the point of the sword so that he could not strike. ",23801,23956
252,"""Are you not happy, since you need not strike?"" ",23956,24004
253,said he. ,11077,11086
254,"""Yes, indeed, I never was happier,"" said the man. ",24013,24063
255,"""That is how happy I was when you delivered me out of the block of ice,"" said the comrade. ",24063,24154
256,"""Keep all you have: I need nothing, for I am a disembodied spirit."" ",24154,24222
257,"And he told him he was the wine-dealer who had lain in the block of ice before the church door, spat upon by all. ",24222,24336
258,"He had become his comrade, and had aided him, because the youth had sacrificed all he had in order that he might have peace, and a burial in consecrated ground. ",24336,24497
259,"He had been permitted to accompany him for the space of a year, and the time had run out when he had first parted with him. ",24497,24621
260,Now he had once more been allowed to visit him; ,24621,24669
261," yet on this occasion he would have to part for all time, for the bells of heaven were calling him.",24668,24768
