0,"Once upon a time there was a poor man, who had only one son; ",0,61
1, but one who was so lazy and clumsy that he did not want to do a stroke of work. ,60,141
2,"""If I am not to feed this bean-pole for the rest of my life, I'll have to send him far away, where not a soul knows him,"" thought the father. ",141,283
3,"""Once he is knocking about in the world, he will not be so likely to come home again."" ",283,370
4,"So he took his son and led him about in the world, far and wide, and tried to get him taken on as a serving man; ",370,483
5, but no one would have him. ,482,510
6,"Finally, after wandering a long time, they came to a rich man, of whom it was said that he turned every shilling around seven times before he could make up his mind to part with it. ",510,692
7,"He was willing to take the youth for a servant, and he was to work three years without pay. ",692,784
8,"But at the end of the three years, his master was to go into town, two days in succession, and buy the first thing he saw, and on the third morning the youth himself was to go to town and also buy the first thing he met. ",784,1005
9,And all this he was to receive in lieu of his wage. ,1005,1057
10,"So the youth served out his three years, and did better than they had expected him to do. ",1057,1147
11,He was by no means a model serving-man; ,1147,1187
12," but then his master was none of the best, either, for he let him go all that time in the same clothes he had worn when he entered his service, until, finally, one patch elbowed the other. ",1186,1375
13,"Now when his master was to go to do his buying, he set out as early as possible in the morning. ",1375,1471
14,"""Costly wares are only to be seen by day,"" said he, ""they are not drifting about the street so early. ",1471,1573
15,"It will probably cost me enough as it is, for what I find is a matter of purest chance."" ",1573,1662
16,"The first thing he saw on the street was an old woman, who was carrying a covered basket. ",1662,1752
17,"""Good-day, granny,"" said the man. ",1752,1786
18,"""And good-day to you, daddy,"" said the old woman. ",1786,1836
19,"""What have you in your basket?"" ",1836,1868
20,asked the man. ,1868,1883
21,"""Would you like to know?"" ",1883,1909
22,said the woman. ,1909,1925
23,"""Yes,"" said the man, ""for I have to buy the first thing that comes my way."" ",1925,2001
24,"""Well, if you want to know, buy it!"" ",2001,2038
25,said the old woman. ,1816,1836
26,"""What does it cost?"" ",2058,2079
27,asked the man. ,1868,1883
28,"She must have four shillings for it, declared the woman. ",2094,2151
29,"This did not seem such a tremendous price to him, he would let it go at that, said he, and raised the cover. ",2151,2260
30,And there lay a pup in the basket. ,2260,2295
31,"When the man got home from his journey to town, there stood the youth full of impatience and curiosity, wondering what his wage for the first year might be. ",2295,2452
32,"""Are you back already, master?"" ",2452,2484
33,asked the youth. ,2484,2501
34,"""Yes, indeed,"" said his master. ",2501,2533
35,"""And what have you bought?"" ",2533,2561
36,asked the youth. ,2484,2501
37,"""What I have bought is nothing so very rare,"" said the man. ",2578,2638
38,"""I don't even know whether I ought to show it to you; ",2638,2692
39," but I bought the first thing to be had, and that was a pup,"" said he. ",2691,2762
40,"""And I thank you most kindly for it,"" said the youth. ",2762,2816
41,"""I have always been fond of dogs."" ",2816,2851
42,The following morning it was no better. ,2851,2891
43,"The man set out as early as possible, and had not as yet reached town before he met the old woman with the basket. ",2891,3006
44,"""Good-day, granny,"" said the man. ",1752,1786
45,"""And good-day to you, daddy,"" said the old woman. ",1786,1836
46,"""What have you in your basket to-day?"" ",3090,3129
47,asked the man. ,1868,1883
48,"""If you want to know, then buy it!"" ",3144,3180
49,was again the answer. ,3180,3202
50,"""What does it cost?"" ",2058,2079
51,asked the man. ,1868,1883
52,"She wanted four shillings for it, she had only the one price. ",3238,3300
53,"The man said he would buy it, for he thought that this time he would make a better purchase. ",3300,3393
54,"He raised the cover, and this time a kitten lay in the basket. ",3393,3456
55,"When he reached home, there stood the youth, waiting to see what he was to get in lieu of his second year's wages. ",3456,3571
56,"""Are you back again, master!"" ",3571,3601
57,said he. ,2753,2762
58,"""Yes, indeed,"" said the master. ",3610,3642
59,"""What did you buy to-day?"" ",3642,3669
60,asked the youth. ,2484,2501
61,"""Alas, nothing better than I did yesterday,"" said the man, ""but I did as we agreed, and bought the first thing I came across, and that was this kitten."" ",3686,3839
62,"""You could not have hit on anything better,"" said the youth, ""for all my life long I have been fond of cats as well as of dogs."" ",3839,3968
63,"""I do not fare so badly this way,"" thought the man, ""but when he sets out for himself, then the matter will probably turn out differently."" ",3968,4108
64,"So the third morning the youth set out for himself, and when he entered town, he came across the same old woman with her basket on her arm. ",4108,4248
65,"""Good morning, granny,"" said he. ",4248,4281
66,"""And good morning to you, my boy,"" said the old woman. ",4281,4336
67,"""What have you in your basket?"" ",1836,1868
68,asked the youth. ,2484,2501
69,"""If you want to know, then buy it!"" ",3144,3180
70,answered the old woman. ,4421,4445
71,"""Do you want to sell it?"" ",4445,4471
72,asked the youth. ,2484,2501
73,"Yes, indeed, and it would cost four shillings, said the old woman. ",4488,4555
74,"That is a bargain, thought the youth, and wanted to take it, for he had to buy the first thing that came his way. ",4555,4669
75,"""Well, you can take the whole blessed lot,"" said the old woman, ""the basket and all that's in it. ",4669,4767
76,"But do not look into it before you get home, do you hear!"" ",4767,4826
77,"No, indeed, he would be sure not to look in the basket, said he. ",4826,4891
78,"But on the way, he kept wondering as to what might be in the basket, and willy-nilly--he could not keep from raising the cover a little, and looking through the crack. ",4891,5059
79,"But that very minute a little lizard popped out of the crack, and ran across the road so quickly that it fairly hummed--and aside from the lizard there was nothing in the basket. ",5059,5238
80,"""Stop, wait a minute, and don't run away! ",5238,5280
81,"I just bought you,"" said the youth. ",5280,5316
82,"""Stab me in the neck! ",5316,5338
83,"Stab me in the neck!"" ",5338,5360
84,cried the lizard. ,5360,5378
85,The youth did not have to be told twice. ,5378,5419
86,He ran after the lizard and stabbed it in the neck just as it was slipping into a hole in a wall. ,5419,5517
87,"And that very moment it turned into a man, as handsome and splendid as the handsomest prince, and a prince he was, if truth be told. ",5517,5650
88,"""Now you have delivered me,"" said he, ""for the old woman, with whom you and your master have been dealing, is a witch, and she turned me into a lizard, and my brother and sister into a dog and cat."" ",5650,5849
89,The youth thought this a remarkable tale. ,5849,5891
90,"""Yes, indeed,"" said the prince. ",5891,5923
91,"""She was actually on the way to throw us into the sea and drown us; ",5923,5991
92," but if any one were to appear and want to buy us, she had to sell us for four shillings apiece, that had been agreed upon. ",5990,6114
93,"And now you shall go home with me to my father, and be rewarded for your good deed."" ",6114,6199
94,"""Your home must be a good way off,"" said the youth. ",6199,6251
95,"""O, it is not so far,"" declared the prince, ""there it is!"" ",6251,6310
96,And he pointed to a high hill in the distance. ,6310,6357
97,"They marched along as fast as they could, but still it was farther away than it seemed. ",6357,6445
98,So it was late at night before they reached their goal. ,6445,6501
99,The prince knocked. ,6501,6521
100,"""Who is knocking at my door, and disturbing my sleep?"" ",6521,6576
101,came a voice within the hill. ,6576,6606
102,And the voice was so powerful that the earth trembled. ,6606,6661
103,"""Open, father, your son has come home!"" ",6661,6701
104,cried the prince. ,6701,6719
105,Then the father was glad to open the door quickly. ,6719,6770
106,"""I thought you were already lying at the bottom of the sea,"" said the old man. ",6770,6849
107,"""But you are not alone?"" ",6849,6874
108,"""This is the chap who delivered me,"" said the prince, ""and I asked him to come with me so that you could reward him."" ",6874,6992
109,"That he would attend to, said the old man. ",6992,7035
110,"""Now you must come right in,"" said he, ""for here you may rest in safety."" ",7035,7109
111,"They went in and sat down, and the old man laid an armful of wood and a couple of big logs on the fire, until every corner was as bright as day, and wherever they looked everything was indescribably splendid. ",7109,7318
112,"The youth had never seen anything like it, and such fine things to eat and drink as the old man served up to him, he had never yet tasted. ",7318,7457
113,"And the bowls and dishes, and goblets and plates, were all of pure silver and shining gold. ",7457,7549
114,There was no need to urge the young folk. ,7549,7591
115,"They ate and drank and enjoyed themselves, and then slept far into the next day. ",7591,7672
116,The youth was still asleep when the old man came and offered him a morning draft in a golden goblet. ,7672,7773
117,"And when he had put on his rags and breakfasted, he was allowed to pick out what he wanted, as a reward for delivering the prince. ",7773,7904
118,"There was much to see and still more to take, as you may believe. ",7904,7970
119,"""Well, what do you want?"" ",7970,7996
120,asked the king. ,7996,8012
121,"""You may take what you will; ",8012,8041
122," for as you see there is enough from which to choose."" ",8040,8095
123,"The youth said he would have to think it over a bit, and speak to the prince. ",8095,8173
124,And that he was allowed to do. ,8173,8204
125,"""Well, I suppose you have seen all sorts of beautiful things?"" ",8204,8267
126,asked the prince. ,8267,8285
127,"""That is a fact,"" said the youth. ",8285,8319
128,"""But tell me, what ought I to choose among all these magnificent things? ",8319,8392
129,"Your father said I might pick out whatever I wished."" ",8392,8446
130,"""You must choose none among all the things you have seen,"" answered the prince, ""but my father wears a ring on his little finger, and you must ask him for that."" ",8446,8608
131,"This the youth did, and begged the king for the ring on his finger. ",8608,8676
132,"""It is dearer to me than anything else I have,"" said the king, ""but my son is just as dear to me, and therefore I will give you the ring. ",8676,8814
133,"Do you know what powers it has?"" ",8814,8847
134,"No, that the youth did not know. ",8847,8880
135,"""While you wear it on your finger, you can get everything that you want to have,"" said the king. ",8880,8977
136,"The youth thanked him most kindly, and the king and the prince wished him all manner of luck on his journey, and charged him to take the best care of the ring. ",8977,9137
137,He had not been long underway before it occurred to him to test what the ring could do. ,9137,9225
138,"So he wished to be dressed in new clothes from head to toe, and no more had he uttered the wish than there he was in them. ",9225,9348
139,And he looked as handsome and bright as a new nickel. ,9348,9402
140,Then he thought to himself it would be pleasant to play a trick on his father. ,9402,9481
141,"""He was none too friendly to me while I was still at home."" ",9481,9541
142,"And so the youth wished he were standing before his father's door, just as ragged as he had been before. ",9541,9646
143,And that very minute there he stood. ,9646,9683
144,"""Good-day, father, and many thanks for the last time!"" ",9683,9738
145,said the youth. ,2800,2816
146,"But when his father saw he had come home far more tattered and torn than when he had gone away, he grew angry and began to scold: ""There is nothing to be made of you, if during all the long years of your service you have not even been able to earn a suit of clothes to your back."" ",9754,10035
147,"""Now do not be so angry, father,"" said the youth. ",10035,10085
148,"""You need not take for granted that a fellow is a vagabond because he goes about in rags. ",10085,10175
149,"Now I want you to go to the king as my proxy, and ask his daughter's hand for me."" ",10175,10258
150,"""Come, come, why, that is utter folly and nonsense!"" ",10258,10311
151,cried his father. ,10311,10329
152,"But the youth insisted that it was gospel truth, and took a birch bough, and drove his father to the king's castle-gate. ",10329,10450
153,"And the latter came stumbling right in to the king, and wept so that the tears just tumbled out. ",10450,10547
154,"""Well, what has happened to you, my dear fellow?"" ",10547,10597
155,asked the king. ,7996,8012
156,"""If a wrong has been done you, I will see that you get your rights."" ",10613,10682
157,"No, no wrong had been done him, said the man, but he had a son who gave him a great deal of trouble: it was impossible to make a man of him, and now he had evidently lost what few senses he did possess. ",10682,10885
158,"""Because he has just chased me to the castle-gate with a birch bough, and threatened me, if I do not get him the king's daughter for a bride,"" said the man. ",10885,11042
159,"""Set your mind at rest, my good fellow,"" said the king, ""and send your son to me. ",11042,11124
160,"Then we will see whether we can come to an understanding."" ",11124,11183
161,"The youth came rushing in to the king, so that his rags fairly fluttered. ",11183,11257
162,"""Do I get your daughter?"" ",11257,11283
163,he cried. ,11283,11293
164,"""Well, that is just what we are going to discuss,"" said the king, ""perhaps she would not answer for you, and perhaps you would not answer for her,"" said he. ",11293,11450
165,"That might be the case, said the youth. ",11450,11490
166,"Now a great ship from abroad had shortly before come into port, and one could see it from the castle window. ",11490,11599
167,"""Now we'll see,"" said the king. ",11599,11631
168,"""If you can build a ship that is the exact counterpart of the one outside, and just as handsome, in the space of an hour or two, then, perhaps, you may get my daughter,"" said the king. ",11631,11816
169,"""If it be no more than that ..."" said the youth. ",11816,11865
170,"Then he went down to the shore and sat on a sand-pile, and when he had sat there long enough, he wished that a ship might lie out in the fjord, completely equipped with masts and sails and all that goes with them, and that it might resemble the ship already lying there in every particular. ",11865,12156
171,"And that very minute there lay the ship, and when the king saw that there were two ships at anchor instead of one, he came down to the shore himself to look more closely into the matter. ",12156,12343
172,And then he saw the youth. ,12343,12370
173,"He was standing in a boat, with a broom in one hand, as though he meant to give the ship a final cleaning; ",12370,12477
174," but when he saw the king coming, he threw away the broom and cried: ""Now the ship is finished. ",12476,12572
175,"Do I get your daughter now?"" ",12572,12601
176,"""That is all very fine,"" said the king, ""but you must stand yet another test. ",12601,12679
177,"If you can build a castle that is just like mine in every particular within an hour or so, then we will go further into the matter."" ",12679,12812
178,"""No more than that?"" ",12812,12833
179,cried the youth. ,12833,12850
180,"After he had strolled around for a long while, and the time set was nearly over, he wished that a castle might stand there that resembled the king's castle in every particular. ",12850,13027
181,"And before long there it stood, as you may believe. ",13027,13079
182,"And it did not take long, either, before the king, together with the queen and the princess, came to look at the new castle. ",13079,13204
183,"The youth stood there with his broom again, and swept and cleaned. ",13204,13271
184,"""Now the castle is in apple-pie order. ",13271,13310
185,"Do I get her now?"" ",13310,13329
186,he cried. ,11283,11293
187,"""That's all very fine,"" declared the king, ""just come in and we'll talk it over,"" said he, for he had noticed that the youth knew a thing or two, and he was thinking over how he might get rid of him. ",13339,13539
188,"The king went on ahead, and after him the queen, and then went the princess, just in advance of the youth. ",13539,13646
189,"Then he at once wished to be the handsomest man in the world, and so he was, that very minute. ",13646,13741
190,"When the princess saw what a splendid figure he suddenly cut, she nudged the queen, who in turn nudged the king, and after they had stared at him long enough, they at last realized that the youth was more than he had at first appeared to be, in his rags. ",13741,13996
191,"So they decided that the princess was to treat him nicely, in order to find out how matters really stood, and the princess was as sweet and amiable as sugar-bread, and flattered the youth, and said that she could not do without him, night or day. ",13996,14243
192,"And when it came toward the end of the first evening, she said: ""Since you and I are to be married in any case, I am sure you will have no secrets from me, and you will not want to hide from me how you managed to do all these fine things."" ",14243,14483
193,"""O, yes,"" said the youth. ",14483,14509
194,"""You shall know about it, but first of all let us be married; ",14509,14571
195," before that nothing counts!"" ",14570,14600
196,The following evening the princess pretended to be quite unhappy. ,14600,14666
197,"She was well aware, said she, that he did not attach much importance to her love, when he would not even tell her what she wanted so much to know. ",14666,14813
198,"If he could not even oblige her in such a small matter, his love could not amount to a great deal. ",14813,14912
199,"Then the youth fell into despair, and to make up with her again, he told her everything. ",14912,15001
200,"She lost no time, and let the king and queen know all about it. ",15001,15065
201,"Thereupon they agreed as to how they would go about getting the youth's ring away from him, and then, thought they, it would not really be hard to get rid of him. ",15065,15228
202,"In the evening the princess came with a sleeping potion, and said she wanted to give her lover a drink that would increase his love for her, since it was plain he did not love her enough. ",15228,15416
203,"The youth suspected nothing, and drank, and at once fell so fast asleep that they could have pulled down the house over his head. ",15416,15546
204,"Then the princess drew the ring from his finger, put it on herself, and wished the youth might be lying on the garbage-pile in the street, just as tattered and torn as he had come to them, and in his place she wanted the handsomest prince in the world. ",15546,15799
205,And that very minute everything happened just as she wished. ,15799,15860
206,"After a time the youth woke up, out on the garbage-pile, and at first thought he was dreaming: but when he saw the ring was gone, he understood how it all had happened, and fell into such despair that he got up and wanted to jump right into the sea. ",15860,16110
207,But then he met the cat his master had bought for him. ,16110,16165
208,"""Where are you going?"" ",16165,16188
209,she asked. ,16188,16199
210,"""To throw myself into the sea and drown,"" was the youth's reply. ",16199,16264
211,"""Do not do so on any account,"" said the cat. ",16264,16309
212,"""You will get your ring again."" ",16309,16341
213,"""Yes, if that were so, then ..."" said the youth. ",16341,16390
214,The cat ran away. ,16390,16408
215,Suddenly a rat crossed her path. ,16408,16441
216,"""Now I will pounce on you!"" ",16441,16469
217,said the cat. ,16295,16309
218,"""O do not do that,"" said the rat, ""you shall have the ring again!"" ",16483,16550
219,"""Well, if that is so, then ..."" said the cat. ",16550,16596
220,"When the folk at the castle had gone to bed, the rat crept around, and sniffed and spied out the room of the prince and princess; ",16596,16726
221, and at last he found a little hole through which he crawled. ,16725,16787
222,"Then he heard the prince and princess talking to each other, and saw that the prince was wearing the ring on his finger. ",16787,16908
223,"Before she went, the princess said: ""Good night. ",16908,16957
224,"And see that you take good care of the ring, my dearest!"" ",16957,17015
225,"""Pooh! ",17015,17022
226,"no one will come in through the walls for the sake of a ring,"" said the prince, ""but if you think it is not safe enough on my hand, why, I can put it in my mouth."" ",17022,17186
227,"After a time he lay down on his back, and prepared to go to sleep. ",17186,17253
228,"But just then the ring slipped down his throat, and he had to cough, so that the ring flew out and rolled along the ground. ",17253,17377
229,"Swish!--the rat had caught it, and crept out with it to the cat, who was waiting at the rat-hole. ",17377,17475
230,"But in the meantime the king had caught the youth, and had had him put in a great tower and condemned to death, because he had made a mock of his daughter--so the king said. ",17475,17649
231,And the youth was to sit in the tower until he was beheaded. ,17649,17710
232,"But the cat kept prowling around the tower all the time, trying to sneak in with the ring. ",17710,17801
233,"And then an eagle came along, caught her up in his claws and flew across the sea with her. ",17801,17892
234,"And suddenly a hawk appeared, and flung himself on the eagle, and the eagle let the cat fall into the sea. ",17892,17999
235,"When she felt the water, she grew afraid, let the ring fall, and swam to land. ",17999,18078
236,No sooner had she shaken the water from her fur than she met the dog whom the youth's master had bought for him. ,18078,18191
237,"""Well, what am I to do now?"" ",18191,18220
238,"said the cat, and wept and lamented. ",18220,18257
239,"""The ring is gone, and they want to murder the youth."" ",18257,18312
240,"""That I do not know,"" said the dog, ""but what I do know is that I have the very worst kind of an ache in my stomach,"" said he. ",18312,18439
241,"""There you have it. ",18439,18459
242,"You have surely over-eaten,"" said the cat. ",18459,18502
243,"""I never eat more than I need,"" said the dog, ""and just now I have eaten nothing at all, save a dead fish that was left here by the ebb-tide."" ",18502,18645
244,"""Could the fish have swallowed the ring?"" ",18645,18687
245,asked the cat. ,18687,18702
246,"""And must you, also, lose your life, because you cannot digest gold?"" ",18702,18772
247,"""That may well be the case,"" said the dog. ",18772,18815
248,"""But then it would be best if I died at once, for then the youth might still be saved."" ",18815,18903
249,"""O, that is not necessary!"" ",18903,18931
250,"said the rat--who was there, too--""I do not need a very large opening through which to crawl, and if the ring is really there, I am sure I can find it."" ",18931,19084
251,"So the rat slipped down into the dog, and before very long he came out again with the ring. ",19084,19176
252,"And then the cat made her way to the tower, and clawed her way up till she found a hole through which she could thrust her paw, and thus brought back the ring to the youth. ",19176,19349
253,"No sooner was it on his finger than he wished that the tower might break down, and that very moment he was standing just before the tower-gate, and reviling the king and the queen and the king's daughter as though they were the lowest of the low. ",19349,19596
254,"The king hastily called together his army, and told it to surround the tower, and take the youth prisoner, dead or alive. ",19596,19718
255,"But the youth only wished the whole army might be sticking up to their necks in the big swamp in the hills, and there they had trouble enough getting out--those among them who did not stick fast. ",19718,19914
256,"Then he went right on reviling where he had stopped, and finally, when he had told them all just what he thought of them, he wished that the king, the queen and the king's daughter might sit for the rest of their lives in the tower into which they had thrust him. ",19914,20178
257,"And when they were sitting there, he took possession of the king's land and country on his own account. ",20178,20282
258,"Then the dog changed into a prince, and the cat into a princess, and he made the latter his wife, and they were married and celebrated their wedding long and profusely.",20282,20451
