1,"It was made of clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter. ",111,189
2,"In the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged with a knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through. ",189,324
3,"Indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence. ",324,385
4,"The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle, which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can attain. ",385,525
5,"There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room. ",525,622
6,"He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value. ",622,756
7,"The rest thought of this fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many other things to talk about. ",756,877

9,"She called out to the others, ""Let us have a game at being men and women, that is something worth playing at."" ",1009,1120

14,"And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings. ",1492,1642
15,"""Each has its own value,"" said the wagon; ",1642,1684
16," ""we cannot all be noblemen. ",1683,1712

18,The money-pig was the only one who received a written invitation. ,1748,1814
19,He stood so high that they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message. ,1814,1891
20,"But in his reply, he said, if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home. ",1891,1987
21,They were to arrange for him to do so; ,1987,2026
22, and so they did. ,2025,2043

25,The rocking-horse spoke of training and races. ,2303,2350

29,"The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud. ",2632,2683
30,"He was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid. ",2683,2792
31,"When the play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; ",2792,2863
32," they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw. ",2862,2960

35,"""Yes, and a fine noise you make,"" thought the audience, as the play went on. ",3106,3183
36,"It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for they were made only to be seen on one side. ",3183,3350
37,"The acting was wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because the wires were a little too long. ",3350,3475
38,"The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much. ",3475,3671
39,"So he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen. ",3671,3820
40,"They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; ",3820,4009
41," and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play. ",4008,4069
42,"All the while, each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be thinking. ",4069,4162
43,"His thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant time--of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might all come to pass. ",4162,4299
44,"Certainly sooner than he expected--for all at once down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces. ",4299,4436

46,"The little ones twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world, and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money. ",4505,4745
47,"The pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it could not rattle. ",4745,4965
