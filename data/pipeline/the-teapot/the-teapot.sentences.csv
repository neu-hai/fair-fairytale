0,THERE was once a proud teapot; ,0,31
1," it was proud of being porcelain, proud of its long spout, proud of its broad handle. ",30,116
2,"It had something before and behind,--the spout before and the handle behind,--and that was what it talked about. ",116,229
3,"But it did not talk of its lid, which was cracked and riveted; ",229,292
4," these were defects, and one does not talk of one's defects, for there are plenty of others to do that. ",291,395

6,The teapot knew it. ,588,608
7,"""I know you,"" it said within itself. ",608,645

12,"I have a spout, and that makes me the queen of the tea table. ",931,993
13,"I spread abroad a blessing on thirsting mankind, for in me the Chinese leaves are brewed in the boiling, tasteless water."" ",993,1116
14,All this said the teapot in its fresh young life. ,1116,1166

16," it was lifted by a very delicate hand, but the delicate hand was awkward. ",1212,1287
17,"The teapot fell, the spout snapped off, and the handle snapped off. ",1287,1355
18,The lid was no worse to speak of; ,1355,1389

30,"Who placed it there, who gave it, I know not; ",2109,2155
31," but given it was, and it became a compensation for the Chinese leaves and the boiling water, a compensation for the broken handle and spout. ",2154,2296
32,"""And the bulb lay in the earth, the bulb lay in me; ",2296,2348
