0,"Once upon a time, in a large forest, there lived an old woman and three maidens. ",0,81
1,"They were all three beautiful, but the youngest was the fairest. ",81,146
2,"Their hut was quite hidden by trees, and none saw their beauty but the sun by day, and the moon by night, and the eyes of the stars. ",146,279
3,"The old woman kept the girls hard at work, from morning till night, spinning gold flax into yarn, and when one distaff was empty another was given them, so they had no rest. ",279,453
4,"The thread had to be fine and even, and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman, who twice or thrice every summer went a journey. ",453,604
5,"Before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence, and always returned in the night, so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her, neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came, nor what it was to be used for. ",604,848
6,"Now, when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of these journeys, she gave each maiden work for six days, with the usual warning: ""Children, don't let your eyes wander, and on no account speak to a man, for, if you do, your thread will lose its brightness, and misfortunes of all kinds will follow."" ",848,1167
7,"They laughed at this oft-repeated caution, saying to each other: ""How can our gold thread lose its brightness, and have we any chance of speaking to a man?"" ",1167,1324
8,"On the third day after the old woman's departure a young prince, hunting in the forest, got separated from his companions, and completely lost. ",1324,1468
9,"Weary of seeking his way, he flung himself down under a tree, leaving his horse to browse at will, and fell asleep. ",1468,1584
10,The sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his way out of the forest. ,1584,1677
11,"At last he perceived a narrow foot-path, which he eagerly followed and found that it led him to a small hut. ",1677,1786
12,"The maidens, who were sitting at the door of their hut for coolness, saw him approaching, and the two elder were much alarmed, for they remembered the old woman's warning; ",1786,1958
13," but the youngest said: ""Never before have I seen anyone like him; ",1957,2024
14," let me have one look."" ",2023,2047
15,"They entreated her to come in, but, seeing that she would not, left her, and the Prince, coming up, courteously greeted the maiden, and told her he had lost his way in the forest and was both hungry and weary. ",2047,2257
16,"She set food before him, and was so delighted with his conversation that she forgot the old woman's caution, and lingered for hours. ",2257,2390
17,"In the meantime the Prince's companions sought him far and wide, but to no purpose, so they sent two messengers to tell the sad news to the King, who immediately ordered a regiment of cavalry and one of infantry to go and look for him. ",2390,2626
18,"After three days' search, they found the hut. ",2626,2672
19,The Prince was still sitting by the door and had been so happy in the maiden's company that the time had seemed like a single hour. ,2672,2804
20,"Before leaving he promised to return and fetch her to his father's court, where he would make her his bride. ",2804,2913
21,"When he had gone, she sat down to her wheel to make up for lost time, but was dismayed to find that her thread had lost all its brightness. ",2913,3053
22,"Her heart beat fast and she wept bitterly, for she remembered the old woman's warning and knew not what misfortune might now befall her. ",3053,3190
23,The old woman returned in the night and knew by the tarnished thread what had happened in her absence. ,3190,3293
24,She was furiously angry and told the maiden that she had brought down misery both on herself and on the Prince. ,3293,3405
25,The maiden could not rest for thinking of this. ,3405,3453
26,"At last she could bear it no longer, and resolved to seek help from the Prince. ",3453,3533
27,"As a child she had learned to understand the speech of birds, and this was now of great use to her, for, seeing a raven pluming itself on a pine bough, she cried softly to it: ""Dear bird, cleverest of all birds, as well as swiftest on wing, will you help me?"" ",3533,3793
28,"""How can I help you?"" ",3793,3815
29,asked the raven. ,3815,3832
30,"She answered: ""Fly away, until you come to a splendid town, where stands a king's palace; ",3832,3922
31," seek out the king's son and tell him that a great misfortune has befallen me."" ",3921,4001
32,"Then she told the raven how her thread had lost its brightness, how terribly angry the old woman was, and how she feared some great disaster. ",4001,4143
33,"The raven promised faithfully to do her bidding, and, spreading its wings, flew away. ",4143,4229
34,"The maiden now went home and worked hard all day at winding up the yarn her elder sisters had spun, for the old woman would let her spin no longer. ",4229,4377
35,"Toward evening she heard the raven's ""craa, craa,"" from the pine tree and eagerly hastened thither to hear the answer. ",4377,4496
36,"By great good fortune the raven had found a wind wizard's son in the palace garden, who understood the speech of birds, and to him he had entrusted the message. ",4496,4657
37,"When the Prince heard it, he was very sorrowful, and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden. ",4657,4764
38,"Then he said to the wind wizard's son: ""Beg the raven to fly quickly back to the maiden and tell her to be ready on the ninth night, for then will I come and fetch her away."" ",4764,4939
39,"The wind wizard's son did this, and the raven flew so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening. ",4939,5044
40,"The maiden thanked the bird heartily and went home, telling no one what she had heard. ",5044,5131
41,"As the ninth night drew near she became very unhappy, for she feared lest some terrible mischance should arise and ruin all. ",5131,5256
42,On this night she crept quietly out of the house and waited trembling at some little distance from the hut. ,5256,5364
43,"Presently she heard the muffled tramp of horses, and soon the armed troop appeared, led by the Prince, who had prudently marked all the trees beforehand, in order to know the way. ",5364,5544
44,"When he saw the maiden he sprang from his horse, lifted her into the saddle, and then, mounting behind, rode homeward. ",5544,5663
45,The moon shone so brightly that they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees. ,5663,5746
46,"By and by the coming of dawn loosened the tongues of all the birds, and, had the Prince only known what they were saying, or the maiden been listening, they might have been spared much sorrow, but they were thinking only of each other, and when they came out of the forest the sun was high in the heavens. ",5746,6052
47,"Next morning, when the youngest girl did not come to her work, the old woman asked where she was. ",6052,6150
48,"The sisters pretended not to know, but the old woman easily guessed what had happened, and, as she was in reality a wicked witch, determined to punish the fugitives. ",6150,6316
49,"Accordingly, she collected nine different kinds of enchanters' nightshade, added some salt, which she first bewitched, and, doing all up in a cloth into the shape of a fluffy ball, sent it after them on the wings of the wind, saying: ""Whirlwind!-mother of the wind! ",6316,6582
50,Lend thy aid against her who sinned! ,6582,6619
51,Carry with thee this magic ball. ,6619,6652
52,"Cast her from his arms for ever, Bury her in the rippling river."" ",6652,6718
53,"At midday the Prince and his men came to a deep river, spanned by so narrow a bridge that only one rider could cross at a time. ",6718,6846
54,The horse on which the Prince and the maiden were riding had just reached the middle when the magic ball flew by. ,6846,6960
55,"The horse in its fright suddenly reared, and before anyone could stop it flung the maiden into the swift current below. ",6960,7080
56,"The Prince tried to jump in after her, but his men held him back, and in spite of his struggles led him home, where for six weeks he shut himself up in a secret chamber, and would neither eat nor drink, so great was his grief. ",7080,7307
57,"At last he became so ill his life was despaired of, and in great alarm the King caused all the wizards of his country to be summoned. ",7307,7441
58,But none could cure him. ,7441,7466
59,"At last the wind wizard's son said to the King: ""Send for the old wizard from Finland he knows more than all the wizards of your kingdom put together."" ",7466,7618
60,"A messenger was at once sent to Finland, and a week later the old wizard himself arrived on the wings of the wind. ",7618,7733
61,"""Honored King,"" said the wizard, ""the wind has blown this illness upon your son, and a magic ball has snatched away his beloved. ",7733,7862
62,This is what makes him grieve so constantly. ,7862,7907
63,"Let the wind blow upon him that it may blow away his sorrow."" ",7907,7969
64,"Then the King made his son go out into the wind, and he gradually recovered and told his father all. ",7969,8070
65,"""Forget the maiden,"" said the King, ""and take another bride"";",8070,8131
66, but the Prince said he could never love another. ,8131,8181
67,A year afterward he came suddenly upon the bridge where his beloved met her death. ,8181,8264
68,"As he recalled the misfortune he wept bitterly, and would have given all he possessed to have her once more alive. ",8264,8379
69,"In the midst of his grief he thought he heard a voice singing, and looked round, but could see no one. ",8379,8482
70,"Then he heard the voice again, and it said: ""Alas! ",8482,8533
71,"bewitched and all forsaken, It is I must lie for ever here! ",8533,8593
72,"My beloved no thought has taken To free his bride, that was so dear."" ",8593,8663
73,"He was greatly astonished, sprang from his horse, and looked everywhere to see if no one were hidden under the bridge; ",8663,8782
74, but no one was there. ,8781,8804
75,"Then he noticed a yellow water-lily floating on the surface of the water, half hidden by its broad leaves; ",8804,8911
76," but flowers do not sing, and in great surprise he waited, hoping to hear more. ",8910,8990
77,"Then again the voice sang: ""Alas! ",8990,9024
78,"bewitched and all forsaken, It is I must lie for ever here! ",8533,8593
79,"My beloved no thought has taken To free his bride, that was so dear."" ",8593,8663
80,"The Prince suddenly remembered the gold-spinners, and said to himself: ""If I ride there, maybe they could explain this to me?"" ",9154,9281
81,"He at once rode to the hut, and found the two maidens at the fountain. ",9281,9352
82,"He told them what had befallen their sister the year before, and how he had twice heard a strange song, but yet could see no singer. ",9352,9485
83,"They said that the yellow water-lily could be none other than their sister, who was not dead, but transformed by the magic ball. ",9485,9614
84,"Before he went to bed, the eldest made a cake of magic herbs, which she gave him to eat. ",9614,9703
85,In the night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand all that the birds said to each other. ,9703,9820
86,"Next morning he told this to the maidens, and they said that the charmed cake had caused it, and advised him to listen well to the birds, and see what they could tell him, and when he had recovered his bride they begged him to return and deliver them from their wretched bondage. ",9820,10100
87,"Having promised this, he joyfully returned home, and as he was riding through the forest he could perfectly understand all that the birds said. ",10100,10244
88,"He heard a thrush say to a magpie: ""How stupid men are! ",10244,10300
89,they cannot understand the simplest thing. ,10300,10343
90,"It is now quite a year since the maiden was transformed into a water-lily, and, though she sings so sadly that anyone going over the bridge must hear her, yet no one comes to her aid. ",10343,10527
91,"Her former bridegroom rode over it a few days ago and heard her singing, but was no wiser than the rest."" ",10527,10633
92,"""And he is to blame for all her misfortunes,"" added the magpie. ",10633,10697
93,"""If he heeds only the words of men she will remain a flower for ever. ",10697,10767
94,"She were soon delivered were the matter only laid before the old wizard of Finland."" ",10767,10852
95,"After hearing this, the Prince wondered how he could get a message conveyed to Finland. ",10852,10940
96,"He heard one swallow say to another: ""Come, let us fly to Finland; ",10940,11007
97," we can build better nests there."" ",11006,11041
98,"""Stop, kind friends!"" ",11041,11063
99,cried the Prince. ,11063,11081
100,"""Will you do something for me?"" ",11081,11113
101,"The birds consented, and he said: ""Take a thousand greetings from me to the wizard of Finland, and ask him how I may restore a maiden transformed into a flower to her own form."" ",11113,11291
102,"The swallows flew away, and the Prince rode on to the bridge. ",11291,11353
103,"There he waited, hoping to hear the song. ",11353,11395
104,"But he heard nothing but the rushing of the water and the moaning of the wind, and, disappointed, rode home. ",11395,11504
105,"Shortly after, he was sitting in the garden, thinking that the swallows must have forgotten his message, when he saw an eagle flying above him. ",11504,11648
106,"The bird gradually descended until it perched on a tree close to the Prince and said: ""The wizard of Finland greets you and bids me say that you may free the maiden thus: Go to the river and smear yourself all over with mud; ",11648,11873
107," then say: 'From a man into a crab,' and you will become a crab. ",11872,11937
108,"Plunge boldly into the water, swim as close as you can to the water-lily's roots, and loosen them from the mud and reeds. ",11937,12059
109,"This done, fasten your claws into the roots and rise with them to the surface. ",12059,12138
110,"Let the water flow all over the flower, and drift with the current until you come to a mountain ash tree on the left bank. ",12138,12261
111,There is near it a large stone. ,12261,12293
112,"Stop there and say: 'From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden,' and you both will be restored to your own forms."" ",12293,12422
113,"Full of doubt and fear, the Prince let some time pass before he was bold enough to attempt to rescue the maiden. ",12422,12535
114,"Then a crow said to him: ""Why do you hesitate? ",12535,12582
115,"The old wizard has not told you wrong, neither have the birds deceived you; ",12582,12658
116," hasten and dry the maiden's tears."" ",12657,12694
117,"""Nothing worse than death can befall me,"" thought the Prince, ""and death is better than endless sorrow."" ",12694,12799
118,So he mounted his horse and went to the bridge. ,12799,12847
119,"Again he heard the water-lily's lament, and, hesitating no longer, smeared himself all over with mud, and, saying: ""From a man into a crab,"" plunged into the river. ",12847,13012
120,"For one moment the water hissed in his ears, and then all was silent. ",13012,13082
121,"He swam up to the plant and began to loosen its roots, but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds that this took him a long time. ",13082,13220
122,"He then grasped them and rose to the surface, letting the water flow over the flower. ",13220,13306
123,"The current carried them down the stream, but nowhere could he see the mountain ash. ",13306,13391
124,"At last he saw it, and close by the large stone. ",13391,13440
125,"Here he stopped and said: ""From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden,"" and to his delight found himself once more a prince, and the maiden was by his side. ",13440,13610
126,"She was ten times more beautiful than before, and wore a magnificent pale yellow robe, sparkling with jewels. ",13610,13720
127,"She thanked him for having freed her from the cruel witch's power, and willingly consented to marry him. ",13720,13825
128,"But when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was nowhere to be seen, for, though the Prince thought he had been a crab only a few hours, he had in reality been under the water for more than ten days. ",13825,14044
129,"While they were wondering how they should reach his father's court, they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses coming along the bank. ",14044,14200
130,In this they drove to the palace. ,14200,14234
131,"The King and Queen were at church, weeping for their son, whom they had long mourned for dead. ",14234,14329
132,"Great was their delight and astonishment when the Prince entered, leading the beautiful maiden by the hand. ",14329,14437
133,The wedding was at once celebrated and there was feasting and merry-making throughout the kingdom for six weeks. ,14437,14550
134,"Some time afterward the Prince and his bride were sitting in the garden, when a crow said to them: ""Ungrateful creatures! ",14550,14672
135,Have you forgotten the two poor maidens who helped you in your distress? ,14672,14745
136,Must they spin gold flax for ever? ,14745,14780
137,Have no pity on the old witch. ,14780,14811
138,"The three maidens are princesses, whom she stole away when they were children together, with all the silver utensils, which she turned into gold flax. ",14811,14962
139,"Poison were her fittest punishment."" ",14962,14999
140,"The Prince was ashamed of having forgotten his promise and set out at once, and by great good fortune reached the hut when the old woman was away. ",14999,15146
141,"The maidens had dreamed that he was coming, and were ready to go with him, but first they made a cake in which they put poison, and left it on a table where the old woman was likely to see it when she returned. ",15146,15357
142,"She did see it, and thought it looked so tempting that she greedily ate it up and at once died. ",15357,15453
143,"In the secret chamber were found fifty wagon-loads of gold flax, and as much more was discovered buried. ",15453,15558
144,"The hut was razed to the ground, and the Prince and his bride and her two sisters lived happily ever after.",15558,15666
