0,The oldest daughter of the Ruler of Heaven had married the great general Li Dsing. ,0,83
1,"Her sons were named Gintscha, Mutscha and Notscha. ",83,134
2,"But when Notscha was given her, she dreamed at night that a Taoist priest came into her chamber and said: ""Swiftly receive the Heavenly Son!"" ",134,276
3,And straightway a radiant pearl glowed within her. ,276,327
4,And she was so frightened at her dream that she awoke. ,327,382
5,"And when Notscha came into the world, it seemed as though a ball of flesh were turning in circles like a wheel, and the whole room was filled with strange fragrances and a crimson light. ",382,569
6,"Li Dsing was much frightened, and thought it was an apparition. ",569,633
7,"He clove the circling ball with his sword, and out of it leaped a small boy whose whole body glowed with a crimson radiance. ",633,758
8,But his face was delicately shaped and white as snow. ,758,812
9,"About his right arm he wore a golden armlet and around his thighs was wound a length of crimson silk, whose glittering shine dazzled the eyes. ",812,955
10,"When Li Dsing saw the child he took pity on him and did not slay him, while his wife began to love the boy dearly. ",955,1070
11,"When three days had passed, all his friends came to wish him joy. ",1070,1136
12,"They were just sitting at the festival meal when a Taoist priest entered and said: ""I am the Great One. ",1136,1240
13,"This boy is the bright Pearl of the Beginning of Things, bestowed upon you as your son. ",1240,1328
14,"Yet the boy is wild and unruly, and will kill many men. ",1328,1384
15,"Therefore I will take him as my pupil to gentle his savage ways."" ",1384,1450
16,Li Dsing bowed his thanks and the Great One disappeared. ,1450,1507
17,When Notscha was seven years old he once ran away from home. ,1507,1568
18,"He came to the river of nine bends, whose green waters flowed along between two rows of weeping-willows. ",1568,1673
19,"The day was hot, and Notscha entered the water to cool himself. ",1673,1737
20,He unbound his crimson silk cloth and whisked it about in the water to wash it. ,1737,1817
21,"But while Notscha sat there and whisked about his scarf in the water, it shook the castle of the Dragon-King of the Eastern Sea to its very foundations. ",1817,1970
22,"So the Dragon-King sent out a Triton, terrible to look upon, who was to find out what was the matter. ",1970,2072
23,When the Triton saw the boy he began to scold. ,2072,2119
24,"But the latter merely looked up and said: ""What a strange-looking beast you are, and you can actually talk!"" ",2119,2228
25,"Then the Triton grew enraged, leaped up and struck at Notscha with his ax. ",2228,2303
26,"But the latter avoided the blow, and threw his golden armlet at him. ",2303,2372
27,The armlet struck the Triton on the head and he sank down dead. ,2372,2436
28,"Notscha laughed and said: ""And there he has gone and made my armlet bloody!"" ",2436,2513
29,"And he once more sat down on a stone, in order to wash his armlet. ",2513,2580
30,Then the crystal castle of the dragon began to tremble as though it were about to fall apart. ,2580,2674
31,And a watchman also came and reported that the Triton had been slain by a boy. ,2674,2753
32,So the Dragon-King sent out his son to capture the boy. ,2753,2809
33,"And the son seated himself on the water-cleaving beast, and came up with a thunder of great waves of water. ",2809,2917
34,"Notscha straightened up and said: ""That is a big wave!"" ",2917,2973
35,"Suddenly he saw a creature rise out of the waves, on whose back sat an armed man who cried in a loud voice: ""Who has slain my Triton?"" ",2973,3108
36,"Notscha answered: ""The Triton wanted to slay me so I killed him. ",3108,3173
37,"What difference does it make?"" ",3173,3204
38,Then the dragon assailed him with his halberd. ,3204,3251
39,"But Notscha said: ""Tell me who you are before we fight."" ",3251,3308
40,"""I am the son of the Dragon-King,"" was the reply. ",3308,3358
41,"""And I am Notscha, the son of General Li Dsing. ",3358,3406
42,"You must not rouse my anger with your violence, or I will skin you, together with that old mud-fish, your father!"" ",3406,3521
43,"Then the dragon grew wild with rage, and came storming along furiously. ",3521,3593
44,"But Notscha cast his crimson cloth into the air, so that it flashed like a ball of fire, and cast the dragon-youth from his breast. ",3593,3725
45,"Then Notscha took his golden armlet and struck him on the forehead with it, so that he had to reveal himself in his true form as a golden dragon, and fall down dead. ",3725,3891
46,"Notscha laughed and said: ""I have heard tell that dragon-sinews make good cords. ",3891,3972
47,"I will draw one out and bring it to my father, and he can tie his armor together with it."" ",3972,4063
48,And with that he drew out the dragon's back sinew and took it home. ,4063,4131
49,"In the meantime the Dragon-King, full of fury, had hastened to Notscha's father Li Dsing and demanded that Notscha be delivered up to him. ",4131,4270
50,"But Li Dsing replied: ""You must be mistaken, for my boy is only seven years old and incapable of committing such misdeeds."" ",4270,4394
51,"While they were still quarreling Notscha came running up and cried: ""Father, I'm bringing along a dragon's sinew for you, so that you may bind up your armor with it!"" ",4394,4561
52,Now the dragon broke out into tears and furious scolding. ,4561,4619
53,"He threatened to report Li Dsing to the Ruler of the Heaven, and took himself off, snorting with rage. ",4619,4722
54,"Li Dsing grew very much excited, told his wife what had happened, and both began to weep. ",4722,4812
55,"Notscha, however, came to them and said: ""Why do you weep? ",4812,4871
56,"I will just go to my master, the Great One, and he will know what is to be done."" ",4871,4953
57,And no sooner had he said the words than he had disappeared. ,4953,5014
58,He came into his master's presence and told him the whole tale. ,5014,5078
59,"The latter said: ""You must get ahead of the dragon, and prevent him from accusing you in Heaven!"" ",5078,5176
60,"Then he did some magic, and Notscha found himself set down by the gate of Heaven, where he waited for the dragon. ",5176,5290
61,It was still early in the morning; ,5290,5325
62," the gate of Heaven had not yet been opened, nor was the watchman at his post. ",5324,5403
63,But the dragon was already climbing up. ,5403,5443
64,"Notscha, whom his master's magic had rendered invisible, threw the dragon to the ground with his armlet, and began to pitch into him. ",5443,5577
65,The dragon scolded and screamed. ,5577,5610
66,"""There the old worm flounders about,"" said Notscha, ""and does not care how hard he is beaten! ",5610,5704
67,"I will scratch off some of his scales."" ",5704,5744
68,"And with these words he began to tear open the dragon's festal garments, and rip off some of the scales beneath his left arm, so that the red blood dripped out. ",5744,5905
69,Then the dragon could no longer stand the pain and begged for mercy. ,5905,5974
70,"But first he had to promise Notscha that he would not complain of him, before the latter would let him go. ",5974,6081
71,"And then the dragon had to turn himself into a little green snake, which Notscha put into his sleeve and took back home with him. ",6081,6211
72,But no sooner had he drawn the little snake from his sleeve than it assumed human shape. ,6211,6300
73,"The dragon then swore that he would punish Li Dsing in a terrible manner, and disappeared in a flash of lightning. ",6300,6415
74,Li Dsing was now angry with his son in earnest. ,6415,6463
75,Therefore Notscha's mother sent him to the rear of the house to keep out of his father's sight. ,6463,6559
76,"Notscha disappeared and went to his master, in order to ask him what he should do when the dragon returned. ",6559,6667
77,His master advised him and Notscha went back home. ,6667,6718
78,"And all the Dragon Kings of the four seas were assembled, and had bound his parents, with cries and tumult, in order to punish them. ",6718,6851
79,"Notscha ran up and cried with a loud voice: ""I will take the punishment for whatever I have done! ",6851,6949
80,My parents are blameless! ,6949,6975
81,"What is the punishment you wish to lay upon me?"" ",6975,7024
82,"""Life for life!"" ",7024,7041
83,said the dragon. ,7041,7058
84,"""Very well then, I will destroy myself!"" ",7058,7099
85,And so he did and the dragons went off satisfied; ,7099,7149
86, while Notscha's mother buried him with many tears. ,7148,7200
87,"But the spiritual part of Notscha, his soul, fluttered about in the air, and was driven by the wind to the cave of the Great One. ",7200,7330
88,"He took it in and said to it: ""You must appear to your mother! ",7330,7393
89,Forty miles distant from your home rises a green mountain cliff. ,7393,7458
90,On this cliff she must build a shrine for you. ,7458,7505
91,"And after you have enjoyed the incense of human adoration for three years, you shall once more have a human body."" ",7505,7620
92,"Notscha appeared to his mother in a dream, and gave her the whole message, and she awoke in tears. ",7620,7719
93,But Li Dsing grew angry when she told him about it. ,7719,7771
94,"""It serves the accursed boy right that he is dead! ",7771,7822
95,It is because you are always thinking of him that he appears to you in dreams. ,7822,7901
96,"You must pay no attention to him."" ",7901,7936
97,"The woman said no more, but thenceforward he appeared to her daily, as soon as she closed her eyes, and grew more and more urgent in his demand. ",7936,8081
98,Finally all that was left for her to do was to erect a temple for Notscha without Li Dsing's knowledge. ,8081,8185
99,And Notscha performed great miracles in his temple. ,8185,8237
100,All prayers made in it were granted. ,8237,8274
101,And from far away people streamed to it to burn incense in his honor. ,8274,8344
102,Thus half a year passed. ,8344,8369
103,"Then Li Dsing, on the occasion of a great military drill, once came by the cliff in question, and saw the people crowding thickly about the hill like a swarm of ants. ",8369,8536
104,Li Dsing inquired what there were to see upon the hill. ,8536,8592
105,"""It is a new god, who performs so many miracles that people come from far and near to honor him."" ",8592,8690
106,"""What sort of a god is he?"" ",8690,8718
107,asked Li Dsing. ,8718,8734
108,They did not dare conceal from him who the god was. ,8734,8786
109,Then Li Dsing grew angry. ,8786,8812
110,"He spurred his horse up the hill and, sure enough, over the door of the temple was written: ""Notscha's Shrine."" ",8812,8924
111,"And within it was the likeness of Notscha, just as he had appeared while living. ",8924,9005
112,"Li Dsing said: ""While you were alive you brought misfortune to your parents. ",9005,9082
113,Now that you are dead you deceive the people. ,9082,9128
114,"It is disgusting!"" ",9128,9147
115,"With these words he drew forth his whip, beat Notscha's idolatrous likeness to pieces with it, had the temple burned down, and the worshipers mildly reproved. ",9147,9306
116,Then he returned home. ,9306,9329
117,Now Notscha had been absent in the spirit upon that day. ,9329,9386
118,When he returned he found his temple destroyed; ,9386,9434
119, and the spirit of the hill gave him the details. ,9433,9483
120,Notscha hurried to his master and related with tears what had befallen him. ,9483,9559
121,"The latter was roused and said: ""It is Li Dsing's fault. ",9559,9616
122,"After you had given back your body to your parents, you were no further concern of his. ",9616,9704
123,"Why should he withdraw from you the enjoyment of the incense?"" ",9704,9767
124,"Then the Great One made a body of lotus-plants, gave it the gift of life, and enclosed the soul of Notscha within it. ",9767,9885
125,"This done he called out in a loud voice: ""Arise!"" ",9885,9935
126,"A drawing of breath was heard, and Notscha leaped up once more in the shape of a small boy. ",9935,10027
127,He flung himself down before his master and thanked him. ,10027,10084
128,"The latter bestowed upon him the magic of the fiery lance, and Notscha thenceforward had two whirling wheels beneath his feet: The wheel of the wind and the wheel of fire. ",10084,10256
129,With these he could rise up and down in the air. ,10256,10305
130,The master also gave him a bag of panther-skin in which to keep his armlet and his silken cloth. ,10305,10402
131,Now Notscha had determined to punish Li Dsing. ,10402,10449
132,"Taking advantage of a moment when he was not watched, he went away, thundering along on his rolling wheels to Li Dsing's dwelling. ",10449,10580
133,The latter was unable to withstand him and fled. ,10580,10629
134,"He was almost exhausted when his second son, Mutscha, the disciple of the holy Pu Hain, came to his aid from the Cave of the White Crane. ",10629,10767
135,A violent quarrel took place between the brothers; ,10767,10818
136," they began to fight, and Mutscha was overcome; ",10817,10865
137, while Notscha once more rushed in pursuit of Li Dsing. ,10864,10920
138,"At the height of his extremity, however, the holy Wen Dschu of the Hill of the Five Dragons, the master of Gintscha, Li Dsing's oldest son, stepped forth and hid Li Dsing in his cave. ",10920,11104
139,"Notscha, in a rage, insisted that he be delivered up to him; ",11104,11165
140," but Wen Dschu said: ""Elsewhere you may indulge your wild nature to your heart's content, but not in this place."" ",11164,11278
141,"And when Notscha in the excess of his rage turned his fiery lance upon him, Wen Dschu stepped back a pace, shook the seven-petaled lotus from his sleeve, and threw it into the air. ",11278,11459
142,"A whirlwind arose, clouds and mists obscured the sight, and sand and earth were flung up from the ground. ",11459,11565
143,Then the whirlwind collapsed with a great crash. ,11565,11614
144,"Notscha fainted, and when he regained consciousness found himself bound to a golden column with three thongs of gold, so that he could no longer move. ",11614,11765
145,Wen Dschu now called Gintscha to him and ordered him to give his unruly brother a good thrashing. ,11765,11863
146,"And this he did, while Notscha, obliged to stand it, stood grinding his teeth. ",11863,11942
147,"In his extremity he saw the Great One floating by, and called out to him: ""Save me, O Master!"" ",11942,12037
148,But the latter did not notice him; ,12037,12072
149, instead he entered the cave and thanked Wen Dschu for the severe lesson which he had given Notscha. ,12071,12172
150,Finally they called Notscha in to them and ordered him to be reconciled to his father. ,12172,12259
151,Then they dismissed them both and seated themselves to play chess. ,12259,12326
152,"But no sooner was Notscha free than he again fell into a rage, and renewed his pursuit of his father. ",12326,12428
153,He had again overtaken Li Dsing when still another saint came forward to defend the latter. ,12428,12520
154,This time it was the old Buddha of the Radiance of the Light. ,12520,12582
155,"When Notscha attempted to battle with him he raised his arm, and a pagoda shaped itself out of red, whirling clouds and closed around Notscha. ",12582,12725
156,Then Radiance of Light placed both his hands on the pagoda and a fire arose within it which burned Notscha so that he cried loudly for mercy. ,12725,12867
157,Then he had to promise to beg his father's forgiveness and always to obey him in the future. ,12867,12960
158,Not till he had promised all this did the Buddha let him out of the pagoda again. ,12960,13042
159,And he gave the pagoda to Li Dsing; ,13042,13078
160, and taught him a magic saying which would give him the mastery over Notscha. ,13077,13155
161,It is for this reason that Li Dsing is called the Pagoda-bearing King of Heaven. ,13155,13236
162,"Later on Li Dsing and his three sons, Gintscha, Mutscha and Notscha, aided King Wu of the Dschou dynasty to destroy the tyrant Dschou-Sin. ",13236,13375
163,None could withstand their might. ,13375,13409
164,Only once did a sorcerer succeed in wounding Notscha in the left arm. ,13409,13479
165,Any other would have died of the wound. ,13479,13519
166,"But the Great One carried him into his cave, healed his wound and gave him three goblets of the wine of the gods to drink, and three fire-dates to eat. ",13519,13671
167,When Notscha had eaten and drunk he suddenly heard a crash at his left side and another arm grew out from it. ,13671,13781
168,He could not speak and his eyes stood out from their sockets with horror. ,13781,13855
169,"But it went on as it had begun: six more arms grew out of his body and two more heads, so that finally he had three heads and eight arms. ",13855,13993
170,"He called out to his Master: ""What does all this mean?"" ",13993,14049
171,"But the latter only laughed and said: ""All is as it should be. ",14049,14112
172,"Thus equipped you will really be strong!"" ",14112,14154
173,Then he taught him a magic incantation by means of which he could make his arms and heads visible or invisible as he chose. ,14154,14278
174,"When the tyrant Dschou-Sin had been destroyed, Li Dsing and his three sons, while still on earth, were taken up into heaven and seated among the gods.",14278,14429
