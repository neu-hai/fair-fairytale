1,"He wanted to become one by Easter, and to marry, and to live by poetry. ",58,130
2,"To write poems, he knew, only consists in being able to invent something. ",130,204

5,"""Happy people who were born a thousand years ago!"" ",373,424
6,said he. ,424,433
7,"""It was an easy matter for them to become immortal. ",433,485

9,"Now the world is written out, and what can I write poetry about?"" ",609,675
10,"Then he studied till he became ill and wretched, the wretched man! ",675,742
11,"No doctor could help him, but perhaps the wise woman could. ",742,802
12,"She lived in the little house by the wayside, where the gate is that she opened for those who rode and drove. ",802,912
13,But she could do more than unlock the gate. ,912,956
14,She was wiser than the doctor who drives in his own carriage and pays tax for his rank. ,956,1044
15,"""I must go to her,"" said the young man. ",1044,1084
16,"The house in which she dwelt was small and neat, but dreary to behold, for there were no flowers near it--no trees. ",1084,1200
17,"By the door stood a bee-hive, which was very useful. ",1200,1253
18,"There was also a little potato-field, very useful, and an earth bank, with sloe bushes upon it, which had done blossoming. ",1253,1376

22,"""Write that down!"" ",1674,1693
23,said she. ,1693,1703
24,"""Even crumbs are bread. ",1703,1727
25,I know why you come hither. ,1727,1755
26,"You cannot invent anything, and yet you want to be a poet by Easter."" ",1755,1825
27,"""Everything has been written down,"" said he. ",1825,1870
28,"""Our time is not the old time."" ",1870,1902
29,"""No,"" said the woman. ",1902,1924
30,"""In the old time wise women were burnt, and poets went about with empty stomachs, and very much out at elbows. ",1924,2035
31,"The present time is good, it is the best of times. ",2035,2086
32,But you have not the right way of looking at it. ,2086,2135
33,"Your ear is not sharpened to hear, and I fancy you do not say the Lord's Prayer in the evening. ",2135,2231
34,"There is plenty here to write poems about, and to tell of, for any one who knows the way. ",2231,2321
35,"You can read it in the fruits of the earth, you can draw it from the flowing and the standing water. ",2321,2422
36,You must understand how--you must understand how to catch a sunbeam. ,2422,2491
37,"Now just you try my spectacles on, and put my ear-trumpet to your ear, and then pray to God, and leave off thinking of yourself."" ",2491,2621
38,The last was a very difficult thing to do--more than a wise woman ought to ask. ,2621,2701
39,"He received the spectacles and the ear-trumpet, and was posted in the middle of the potato-field. ",2701,2799
40,She put a great potato into his hand. ,2799,2837
41,Sounds came from within it. ,2837,2865
42,"There came a song with words, the history of the potato, an every-day story in ten parts, an interesting story. ",2865,2977
43,And ten lines were enough to tell it in. ,2977,3018
44,And what did the potato sing? ,3018,3048
45,"She sang of herself and of her family, of the arrival of the potato in Europe, of the misrepresentation to which she had been exposed before she was acknowledged, as she is now, to be a greater treasure than a lump of gold. ",3048,3272
46,"""We were distributed, by the King's command, from the council-houses through the various towns, and proclamation was made of our great value. ",3272,3414
47,"But no one believed in it, or even understood how to plant us. ",3414,3477
48,One man dug a hole in the earth and threw in his whole bushel of potatoes. ,3477,3552
49,"Another put one potato here and another there in the ground, and expected that each was to come up a perfect tree, from which he might shake down potatoes. ",3552,3708
50,"And they certainly grew, and produced flowers and green watery fruit, but it all withered away. ",3708,3804
51,Nobody thought of what was in the ground--the blessing--the potato. ,3804,3872
52,"Yes, we have endured and suffered, that is to say, our forefathers have; ",3872,3945
53," they and we, it is all one."" ",3944,3974
54,What a story it was! ,3974,3995

58,"""There were Northmen, from Norway, who steered westward through mist and storm to an unknown land, where, behind ice and snow, they found plants and green meadows, and bushes with blue-black grapes--sloe bushes. ",4191,4403
59,The grapes were ripened by the frost just as we are. ,4403,4456
60,"And they called the land 'wine-land,' that is, 'Groenland,' or 'Sloeland.'"" ",4456,4532
61,"""That is quite a romantic story,"" said the young man. ",4532,4586

64,He looked into it. ,4680,4699
65,What life and labor! ,4699,4720
66,"There were bees standing in all the passages, waving their wings, so that a wholesome draught of air might blow through the great manufactory. ",4720,4863
67,That was their business. ,4863,4888
68,"Then there came in bees from without, who had been born with little baskets on their feet. ",4888,4979
69,"They brought flower-dust, which was poured out, sorted, and manufactured into honey and wax. ",4979,5072
70,They flew in and out. ,5072,5094
71,"The queen-bee wanted to fly out, but then all the other bees must have gone with her. ",5094,5180
72,"It was not yet the time for that, but still she wanted to fly out. ",5180,5247
73,"So the others bit off her majesty's wings, and she had to stay where she was. ",5247,5325
