0,Once upon a time there was a king who went forth into the world and fetched back a beautiful queen. ,0,100
1,And after they had been married a while God gave them a little daughter. ,100,173
2,"Then there was great rejoicing in the city and throughout the country, for the people wished their king all that was good, since he was kind and just. ",173,324
3,"While the child lay in its cradle, a strange-looking old woman entered the room, and no one knew who she was nor whence she came. ",324,454
4,"The old woman spoke a verse over the child, and said that she must not be allowed out under the open sky until she were full fifteen years of age, since otherwise the mountain troll would fetch her. ",454,653
5,"When the king heard this he took her words to heart, and posted guards to watch over the little princess so that she would not get out under the open sky. ",653,808
6,"Some time afterward God gave the royal pair another little daughter, and again the whole kingdom rejoiced. ",808,915
7,"But the wise old woman once more put in an appearance, and warned the king not to let the princess out under the open sky until she were full fifteen years of age. ",915,1079
8,"And then, after a time, God gave the royal pair a third daughter. ",1079,1145
9,"This time, too, the old woman appeared, and repeated what she had already twice said. ",1145,1231
10,Then the king was much grieved; ,1231,1263
11, for he loved his children above everything in the world. ,1262,1320
12,"Therefore he gave strict orders that the three princesses were always to be kept beneath the roof of the castle, and that none were to dare transgress against this command. ",1320,1493
13,"Now a long time passed, and the king's daughters grew up and became the most beautiful maidens of whom one has ever heard tell. ",1493,1621
14,"Then war broke out and the king, their father, had to leave them. ",1621,1687
15,"One day, while he was away at war, the three princesses were sitting in the window and looking out, watching the sun shine on the little flowers in the garden. ",1687,1847
16,"And they felt a great desire to play with the lovely flowers, and begged their guards to let them go into the garden for a little while. ",1847,1984
17,"But this their guards would not allow, for they feared the king's anger. ",1984,2057
18,Yet the king's daughters pleaded so very sweetly that they could not deny their pleas and they let them have their way. ,2057,2177
19,"But the princesses did not have long to walk about, for no sooner were they beneath the open sky, than a cloud came suddenly down, and bore them off, and all attempts to regain possession of them were fruitless; ",2177,2389
20, though search was made in every direction. ,2388,2432
21,"Then the whole kingdom mourned and grieved, and one may imagine that the king was anything but happy when he returned home and learned all that had happened. ",2432,2590
22,"Yet what is done cannot be undone, and in the end they had to resign themselves to it. ",2590,2677
23,"And since the king knew of no other way to help himself, he had proclaimed throughout the kingdom that whoever would deliver his three daughters out of the power of the mountain troll should have one of them for his bride, and with her half of the kingdom. ",2677,2934
24,"When this became known in foreign lands, many youths set forth with horses and followers to seek the princesses. ",2934,3047
25,At the king's court were two princes who also went forth to see whether fortune would be kind to them. ,3047,3150
26,"They armed themselves in the best possible way with coats of mail and costly weapons, and bragged and boasted that they would not return without having done what they set out to do. ",3150,3332
27,"And now we will let the king's sons ride out over the world on their quest, while we turn to other people. ",3332,3439
28,"Far, far out in the wild wood there lived a poor widow, who had an only son who drove his mother's pigs to pasture every day. ",3439,3565
29,"And as he crossed the fields, he whittled himself a flute, and amused himself playing it. ",3565,3655
30,And he played so sweetly that he warmed the cockles of the hearts of all those who heard him. ,3655,3749
31,"Now it chanced that the young swine-herd once sat in the wood blowing his flute, while his three pigs were digging under the pine-roots. ",3749,3886
32,"And an old, old man came along, with a beard so long and so broad that it hung far below his girdle. ",3886,3987
33,"The old man had a large, powerful dog with him. ",3987,4035
34,"When the youth saw the great dog, he thought to himself: ""If a fellow had a dog like that to keep him company here in the wilderness, he might consider himself lucky."" ",4035,4203
35,"And when the old man noticed this, he began: ""That is why I have come, for I want to exchange my dog for one of your pigs."" ",4203,4327
36,"The youth was at once willing, and closed the bargain. ",4327,4382
37,"He received the great dog, and gave up the gray pig in place of it. ",4382,4450
38,Then the old man went his way. ,4450,4481
39,"But as he left he said: ""You have reason to be satisfied with our exchange, for that dog is not like other dogs. ",4481,4594
40,His name is 'Take Hold!' ,4594,4619
41,"and whatever you tell him to take hold of he will seize, even though it were the grimmest of trolls."" ",4619,4721
42,"Thereupon they parted, and the youth thought that fortune had indeed favored him. ",4721,4803
43,In the evening he called his dog and drove his pigs home. ,4803,4861
44,"But when his old mother heard that he had given away the gray pig for a dog, she was angry beyond measure, and gave her son a good drubbing. ",4861,5002
45,The youth told her to calm herself; ,5002,5038
46," but all in vain, the longer it lasted the more furious she became. ",5037,5105
47,"Then, since he did not know what else to do, he called out to his dog: ""Take hold!"" ",5105,5189
48,"At once the dog ran up, seized the old mother and held her so tightly that she could not move. ",5189,5284
49,But otherwise he did her no harm. ,5284,5318
50,"And now she had to promise her son to make the best of the matter, and then they were friends once more. ",5318,5423
51,"The following day the youth went to the wood again, with his dog and the two pigs. ",5423,5506
52,"After a time he sat down and played his flute as usual, and the dog danced to his playing with such skill, that it was nothing short of a miracle. ",5506,5653
53,"And as he was sitting there, the old man with the gray beard came out of the wood again, and with him another dog, no smaller than the first. ",5653,5795
54,"When the youth saw the handsome beast he thought to himself: ""If a fellow had that dog to keep him company here where it is so lonely, he need have no fear."" ",5795,5953
55,"When the old man noticed this, he began: ""That is why I have come, for I want to exchange my dog for one of your pigs."" ",5953,6073
56,"The youth did not lose any time, but agreed to close the bargain. ",6073,6139
57,"He received the great dog, and gave up one of his pigs in place of it. ",6139,6210
58,Then the old man went his way. ,4450,4481
59,"Yet before he left he added: ""You have reason to be well satisfied with your purchase, for this dog is not like the other dogs. ",6241,6369
60,His name is 'Tear!' ,6369,6389
61,"and if you give him something to tear, he will tear it to pieces, even though it were the grimmest of trolls."" ",6389,6500
62,Then they parted. ,6500,6518
63,But the youth was happy in the idea that he had made a capital exchange; ,6518,6591
64, although he knew that his old mother would not be content with it. ,6590,6658
65,"And when evening came, and the youth went home, his old mother was no less angry than she had been before. ",6658,6765
66,"But this time she did not venture to beat her son, because she was afraid of the great dogs. ",6765,6858
67,"Yet, as is usual, when women have scolded long enough, they stop of their own accord-and that is what happened in this case. ",6858,6983
68,The youth and his mother made peace with each other; ,6983,7036
69, though the mother thought to herself that the damage done could not well be repaired. ,7035,7122
70,On the third day the youth went into the wood again with his pig and two dogs. ,7122,7201
71,"He felt very happy, seated himself on a tree-stump and played his flute as usual. ",7201,7283
72,And the dogs danced to his playing with such skill that it was a pleasure to watch them. ,7283,7372
73,"As the youth was sitting there in peace and quiet, the old gray-beard once more came out of the wood. ",7372,7474
74,"This time he had a third dog with him, who was as large as both the others together. ",7474,7559
75,"When the youth saw the handsome animal he could not help but think: ""If a fellow had this dog to keep him company in the wilderness, he would have no cause for complaint."" ",7559,7731
76,"The old man at once began: ""That is why I have come, in order to sell my dog, for I can see you would like to have him."" ",7731,7852
77,The youth was at once willing and agreed to close the bargain. ,7852,7915
78,So he received the great dog and gave up his last pig in place of it. ,7915,7985
79,Then the old man went his way. ,4450,4481
80,"Yet before he went he said: ""You will be satisfied with your exchange, for this dog is not like other dogs. ",8016,8124
81,His name is 'Hark!' ,8124,8144
82,"and his hearing is so keen that he hears everything that happens, though it be happening many miles away. ",8144,8250
83,"He even hears the grass and the trees grow."" ",8250,8295
84,Then they parted in the friendliest spirit. ,8295,8339
85,But the youth was happy in the thought that now he need fear nothing in the world. ,8339,8422
86,"And then, when evening came on, and the swine-herd went home, his mother was very sad to think that her son had sold all they possessed. ",8422,8559
87,"But the youth told her to be of good courage, since he would see to it that they did not suffer want. ",8559,8661
88,"And when he spoke to her in such a cheerful manner, she grew content again, and decided that he had spoken in wise and manly fashion. ",8661,8795
89,"Then when day dawned the youth went hunting with his dogs, and came back at evening with as much game as he could possibly carry. ",8795,8925
90,And he continued to go hunting in this way for a time until his old mother's store-room was well provided with meat and all sorts of good things. ,8925,9071
91,"Then he bade his mother a fond farewell, called his dogs, and said he was going to wander out into the world and try his fortune. ",9071,9201
92,"And he fared forth over mountains and tangled ways, and came into the heart of a sombre forest. ",9201,9297
93,There he met the gray-beard of whom I have already told you. ,9297,9358
94,"And when he met him the youth was much pleased, and said: ""Good-day, grandfather, and thanks for the last time!"" ",9358,9471
95,"And the old man replied: ""Good-day to you, and whither away?"" ",9471,9533
96,"The youth answered: ""I am wandering out into the world to see what fortune has in store for me."" ",9533,9630
97,"Then the old man said: ""Keep right on going till you come to the royal castle, and there your fortune will take a turn."" ",9630,9751
98,And with that they parted. ,9751,9778
99,The youth followed the old man's advice and for a time wandered on straight ahead. ,9778,9861
100,"When he came to a tavern he played his flute and let his dogs dance, and was never at a lack for bed and board, and whatever else he might want. ",9861,10006
101,"After he had wandered long and far, he at length came to a great city, whose streets were filled with people. ",10006,10116
102,"The youth wondered what it all meant, and at last reached the spot where, to the sound of bell, the king's proclamation was being cried-that whoever should deliver the three princesses out of the power of the troll, would receive one of them, and half the kingdom as well. ",10116,10389
103,Now he understood what the old man had meant. ,10389,10435
104,"He called his dogs, and went to the king's castle. ",10435,10486
105,But there all had been grief and mourning since the day the king's daughters had disappeared. ,10486,10580
106,And of them all the king and queen were the most sorrowful. ,10580,10640
107,"Then the youth went to the keeper of the door, and asked him whether he might play and show his dogs before the king. ",10640,10758
108,"The courtiers were willing, for they hoped it might make him feel more cheerful. ",10758,10839
109,So he was admitted and allowed to show his tricks. ,10839,10890
110,"And when the king had heard him play, and had seen the skillful dancing of his dogs, he grew quite merry, and none had seen him as happy during all the seven long years that had passed since he had lost his daughters. ",10890,11108
111,"When the dance was over, the king asked the youth what he asked as a reward for having given him such a pleasure. ",11108,11222
112,"The youth answered: ""My lord king, I did not come to you to win gold and gear. ",11222,11301
113,"But I have another request to make: that you allow me to set out and search for your three daughters, carried away by a mountain troll."" ",11301,11438
114,"When the king heard this his thoughts once more grew gloomy, and he replied: ""You need not even think of delivering my daughters. ",11438,11568
115,"It is no child's play, and your betters have already attempted it in vain. ",11568,11643
116,"Yet should it really come to pass that you deliver one of the princesses, you may be sure that I will not break my word."" ",11643,11765
117,So he took leave of the king and set forth. ,11765,11809
118,And he decided to take no rest until he had found what he sought. ,11809,11875
119,Now he passed through many broad kingdoms without meeting with any special adventures. ,11875,11962
120,And wherever he went his dogs followed him. ,11962,12006
121,"""Hark!"" ",12006,12014
122,ran along and listened for anything worth hearing to be heard around them; ,12014,12089
123," ""Take Hold!"" ",12088,12102
124,"carried his master's knapsack and ""Tear!"" ",12102,12144
125,"who was the strongest, carried his master when the latter was weary. ",12144,12213
126,"One day ""Hark!"" ",12213,12229
127,"came running up hastily, and told his master that he had gone to a high mountain, and had heard the king's daughter, who sat within it and span, and that the troll was not at home. ",12229,12410
128,"This greatly pleased the youth, and he hurried toward the mountain together with his three dogs. ",12410,12507
129,"When they got there ""Hark!"" ",12507,12535
130,"said: ""There is no time to lose. ",12535,12568
131,"The troll is only ten miles away, and I can already hear the golden horse-shoes of his steed ringing on the stones."" ",12568,12685
132,"The youth now ordered his dogs to break down the door into the mountain, and they did. ",12685,12772
133,"And as he stepped into the mountain he saw a lovely maiden, sitting in the mountain-hall, winding a golden thread on a golden spindle. ",12772,12907
134,The youth went up and greeted the lovely girl. ,12907,12954
135,"Then the king's daughter was much surprised and said: ""Who are you that dare to venture into the giant's hall? ",12954,13065
136,"During all the seven long years I have been sitting here in the mountain I have never yet seen a human being."" ",13065,13176
137,"And she added: ""For heaven's sake hasten away before the troll returns home, or else your life will be forfeit!"" ",13176,13289
138,"But the youth was unafraid, and said that he would await the giant's return without fear. ",13289,13379
139,"While they were talking together, the giant came riding along on his colt shod with gold. ",13379,13469
140,"When he saw the gate standing open he grew furiously angry and shouted till the whole mountain shook: ""Who has broken my mountain door?"" ",13469,13606
141,"The youth boldly answered: ""I did, and now I shall break you as well! ",13606,13676
142,'Take Hold!' ,4606,4619
143,seize him! ,13689,13700
144,'Tear!' ,6381,6389
145,and 'Hark!' ,13708,13720
146,"tear him into a thousand pieces."" ",13720,13754
147,"No sooner had he spoken than the dogs rushed up, fell upon the giant and tore him into countless pieces. ",13754,13859
148,"Then the princess was happy beyond measure and said: ""God be praised, now I am freed!"" ",13859,13946
149,And she fell upon the youth's neck and gave him a kiss. ,13946,14002
150,"But he did not wish to stay there any longer, saddled the giant's colt, loaded it with all the gold and gear he found in the mountain, and hastily went away with the king's beautiful daughter. ",14002,14195
151,They passed on together a long distance. ,14195,14236
152,"Then, one day, ""Hark!"" ",14236,14259
153,"who always ran ahead scouting, came quickly back to his master, and told him he had been near a high mountain, and had heard the king's second daughter sitting within it winding golden yarn, and that the troll himself was not at home. ",14259,14494
154,"This was very welcome news for the youth, and he hurried toward the mountain with his faithful dogs. ",14494,14595
155,"Now when they drew near ""Hark!"" ",14595,14627
156,"said: ""There is no time to lose. ",12535,12568
157,"The giant is only eight miles away, and I can already hear the golden horse-shoes of his steed ringing on the stones."" ",14660,14779
158,"The youth at once ordered his dogs to break down the door into the mountain, no matter which way. ",14779,14877
159,"And when he stepped into the interior of the mountain he saw a lovely maiden sitting in the mountain hall, winding golden yarn on a golden windle. ",14877,15024
160,The youth went up and greeted the lovely girl. ,12907,12954
161,"The king's daughter was much surprised and said: ""Who are you that dare to venture into the giant's hall? ",15071,15177
162,"During all the seven years I have been sitting here in the mountain I have never yet seen a human being."" ",15177,15283
163,"And she added: ""For heaven's sake, hasten away, for if the troll comes your life will be forfeit!"" ",15283,15382
164,"But the youth told her why he had come, and said that he would await the troll's return quite undisturbed. ",15382,15489
165,"While they were still talking together, the giant came riding on his steed shod with gold, and drew up outside the mountain. ",15489,15614
166,"When he noticed that the great door was open, he grew furiously angry, and shouted till the mountain trembled to its very roots. ",15614,15743
167,"He said: ""Who has broken my mountain door?"" ",15743,15787
168,"The youth boldly answered: ""I have, and now I shall break you as well! ",15787,15858
169,"'Take Hold,' seize him! ",15858,15882
170,'Tear!' ,6381,6389
171,and 'Hark!' ,13708,13720
172,"tear him into a thousand pieces!"" ",15902,15936
173,"The dogs at once rushed up, threw themselves upon the giant, and tore him into as many pieces as leaves fall in the autumn. ",15936,16060
174,"Then the king's daughter was happy beyond measure and cried: ""God be praised, now I am freed!"" ",16060,16155
175,and she fell upon the youth's neck and gave him a kiss. ,16155,16211
176,"But he led the princess to her sister, and one can imagine-how glad they were to see each other again. ",16211,16314
177,"Then the youth packed up all the treasures he found in the mountain hall, loaded them on the giant's steed, and went his way with the king's two daughters. ",16314,16470
178,And they wandered along for a long time. ,16470,16511
179,"Then, one day, ""Hark!"" ",14236,14259
180,"who always ran ahead scouting, came hastily to his master and told him that he had been near a high mountain, and had heard the king's third daughter sitting within and weaving a web of gold, and that the troll was not at home. ",16534,16762
181,"This was very welcome news for the youth, and he hastened toward the mountain, followed by his three dogs. ",16762,16869
182,"When he drew near ""Hark!"" ",16869,16895
183,"said: ""There is no time to lose, for the giant is only five miles away. ",16895,16967
184,"I can already hear the golden horse-shoes of his steed ringing on the stones."" ",12606,12685
185,"Then the youth at once ordered his dogs to break down the door into the mountain, by hook or by crook. ",17046,17149
186,"And when he stepped into the mountain, he saw a girl sitting in the mountain hall, weaving a web of gold. ",17149,17255
187,"But this maiden was lovely beyond all measure, with a loveliness exceeding all the youth had ever thought to find on earth. ",17255,17379
188,He now went up and greeted the lovely maiden. ,17379,17425
189,"Then the king's daughter was much surprised and said: ""Who are you that dare to venture into the giant's hall? ",12954,13065
190,"During all the seven long years I have been sitting here in the mountain I have never yet seen a human being."" ",13065,13176
191,"And she added: ""For heaven's sake, hasten away before the troll comes, or else your life will be forfeit!"" ",17647,17754
192,"But the youth was full of confidence, and said he would gladly venture his life for the king's lovely daughter. ",17754,17866
193,"While they were still talking the giant came riding along on his colt shod with gold, and drew up at the foot of the mountain. ",17866,17993
194,"When he went in he saw that uninvited guests had arrived, and was much frightened; ",17993,18076
195, for well he knew of the fate that had befallen his brothers. ,18075,18137
196,"He therefore thought it advisable to fall back upon cunning and treachery, for he had not dared to venture on open battle. ",18137,18260
197,"For that reason he made many fine speeches, and was very friendly and smooth with the youth. ",18260,18353
198,Then he told the king's daughter to prepare a meal in order to show his guest all hospitality. ,18353,18448
199,"And since the troll knew so well how to talk, the youth allowed himself to be beguiled by his smooth words, and forgot to be on his guard. ",18448,18587
200,He sat down to the table with the giant; ,18587,18628
201," but the king's daughter wept secretly, and the dogs were very restless; ",18627,18700
202, though no one paid them any attention. ,18699,18739
203,"When the giant and his guest had finished their meal, the youth said: ""Now that I have satisfied my hunger, give me something to quench my thirst!"" ",18739,18887
204,"The giant replied: ""On the mountain-top is a spring in which bubbles the clearest wine; ",18887,18975
205," but I have no one to fetch it."" ",18974,19007
206,"The youth answered: ""If that be all that is lacking, one of my dogs can go up."" ",19007,19087
207,"Then the giant laughed in his false heart, for nothing suited him better than to have the youth send away his dogs. ",19087,19203
208,"The youth ordered ""Take Hold!"" ",19203,19234
209,"to go to the spring, and the giant handed him a great tankard. ",19234,19297
210,The dog went; ,19297,19311
211, yet it was easy to see that he did not go willingly; ,19310,19364
212, and the time passed and passed and he did not return. ,19363,19418
213,"After a while the giant said: ""I wonder why your dog stays away so long? ",19418,19491
214,Perhaps you would let another of your dogs go and help him; ,19491,19551
215," for the way is long and the tankard is heavy."" ",19550,19598
216,The youth did not suspect any trickery and agreed. ,19598,19649
217,"He told ""Tear!"" ",19649,19665
218,"to go and see why ""Take Hold!"" ",19665,19696
219,had not yet come. ,19696,19714
220,"The dog wagged his tail, and did not want to leave his master. ",19714,19777
221,But the youth did not notice it and drove him off himself. ,19777,19836
222,"Then the giant laughed heartily, and the king's daughter wept, yet the youth paid no attention; ",19836,19932
223," but was merry and at his ease, played with his sword, and dreamed of no danger. ",19931,20012
224,Thus a long time passed; ,20012,20037
225, but nothing was heard of the wine nor of the dogs. ,20036,20088
226,"Then the giant said: ""I can see that your dogs do not do as you bid them, otherwise we should not have to sit here and thirst. ",20088,20215
227,I think it would be well if you let 'Hark!' ,20215,20259
228,"go up and see why they do not come back."" ",20259,20301
229,"The youth agreed, and told his third dog to hurry to the spring. ",20301,20366
230,"But ""Hark!"" ",20366,20378
231,"did not want to, and instead crept whining to his master's feet. ",20378,20443
232,Then the youth grew angry and drove him off by force. ,20443,20497
233,"And when he reached the top of the mountain he shared the fate of the others, a high wall rose round about him, and he was made a prisoner by the giant's magic power. ",20497,20664
234,"Now that all three dogs were gone, the giant rose, and suddenly looked altogether different. ",20664,20757
235,"He took down a long sword from the wall, and said: ""Now I will do what my brothers did not do, and you must die at once, for you are in my power!"" ",20757,20904
236,"Then the youth was frightened, and he regretted he had allowed his dogs to leave him. ",20904,20990
237,"He said: ""I do not ask for my life, since in any event the time will come when I must die. ",20990,21081
238,"But I would like to repeat the Lord's prayer, and play a psalm on my flute, for such is the custom in my country."" ",21081,21196
239,"The giant granted his prayer, but said that he would not wait long. ",21196,21264
240,So the youth kneeled and began to blow his flute till it sounded over hill and dale. ,21264,21349
241,And that very moment the magic wall was broken and the dogs were freed. ,21349,21421
242,"They came rushing on like the storm-wind, and fell upon the mountain troll. ",21421,21497
243,"The youth at once rose and said: ""'Take Hold!'",21497,21543
244,"', seize him! ",21542,21556
245,'Tear!' ,6381,6389
246,and 'Hark!' ,13708,13720
247,"tear him into a thousand pieces!"" ",15902,15936
248,Then the dogs flung themselves on the giant and tore him into countless pieces. ,21610,21690
249,"Then the youth took all the treasures that lay in the mountain, hitched the giant's horses to a gilded wagon, and drove off as fast as he could. ",21690,21835
250,"Now when the king's daughters met again there was great joy, as may well be imagined, and all thanked the youth for delivering them out of the power of the mountain trolls. ",21835,22008
251,"But the youth fell deeply in love with the youngest princess, and they promised to be true to each other. ",22008,22114
252,"So the king's daughters passed on their way with music and merriment of every kind, and the youth served them with all the honor and courtesy due maidens of gentle birth. ",22114,22285
253,"And while they were underway the princesses toyed with the youth's hair, and each tied her golden ring in his locks for remembrance. ",22285,22418
254,"One day while they were still underway, they met two wanderers, who were traveling the same road. ",22418,22516
255,"The clothes of the two strangers were torn and their feet were sore, and their whole appearance showed that they had a long journey behind them. ",22516,22661
256,"The youth stopped his wagon, and asked them who they were and whence they came. ",22661,22741
257,"The strangers answered that they were two princes, and had gone forth to search for the three maidens in the mountain. ",22741,22860
258,But fortune had not favored them; ,22860,22894
259, and now they had to return home more like journeymen than kings' sons. ,22893,22965
260,"When the youth heard this he felt sorry for the two wanderers, and asked whether they would like to ride with him in his handsome wagon. ",22965,23102
261,The princes thanked him profusely for his offer. ,23102,23151
262,"They drove on together, and came to the kingdom over which the father of the princesses reigned. ",23151,23248
263,"Now when the princes learned that the youth had delivered the king's three daughters, a great jealousy took possession of them, and they thought of how badly they had fared in their own venture. ",23248,23443
264,"And they took counsel together as to how they might get the better of the youth, and win power and glory for themselves. ",23443,23564
265,But they hid their evil plot till a favorable opportunity offered for carrying it out. ,23564,23651
266,"Then they suddenly threw themselves on their comrade, seized him by the throat and strangled him. ",23651,23749
267,And then they threatened to kill the princesses if they did not swear to keep silence. ,23749,23836
268,"And since the king's daughters were in the power of the princes, they did not dare say no. ",23836,23927
269,"But they felt very sorry for the youth who had given up his life for them, and the youngest princess mourned with all her heart, and all her happiness was at an end. ",23927,24093
270,"After this great wrong the princes drove to the royal castle, and one may well imagine how happy the king was to get back his three daughters. ",24093,24236
271,In the meantime the poor youth lay like dead off in a gorge in the forest. ,24236,24311
272,"Yet he was not quite dead, and his faithful dogs lay about him, kept him warm, and licked his wounds. ",24311,24413
273,And they did not stop until their master came back to life again. ,24413,24479
274,"When he was once more well and strong he set out, and after many difficulties came to the royal castle in which the princesses dwelt. ",24479,24613
275,"When he came in the whole court was full of joy and merriment, and from the king's hall came the sound of dancing and string music. ",24613,24745
276,"That surprised him greatly, and he asked what it all meant. ",24745,24805
277,"The serving-man answered: ""You must come from far away, since you do not know that the king has regained his daughters who were in the power of the mountain troll. ",24805,24969
278,"This is the oldest princess's wedding-day."" ",24969,25013
279,"The youth then asked after the youngest princess, and when she was to marry. ",25013,25090
280,"But the serving-man said that she did not want a husband, and wept the live-long day, though no one knew why. ",25090,25200
281,Then the youth felt happy once more; ,25200,25237
282," for now he knew that she loved him, and had kept faith with him. ",25236,25302
283,"The youth now went to the keeper of the door, and bade him tell the king that a guest had arrived who would add to the merriment of the wedding festivities by showing his dogs. ",25302,25479
284,"This was to the king's liking, and he ordered that the stranger receive the best possible treatment. ",25479,25580
285,"And when the youth stepped into the hall, the whole wedding company were astounded by his skill and his manly bearing, and all agreed that so handsome a youth was rarely seen. ",25580,25756
286,"But no sooner had the king's three daughters recognized him, than they jumped up from the table, and flung themselves on his neck. ",25756,25887
287,And then the princes thought it best to make themselves scarce. ,25887,25951
288,"But the king's daughters told how the youth had freed them, and the rest of their adventures; ",25951,26045
289, and to make quite certain they looked for their rings among his locks. ,26044,26116
290,"Now when the king heard of the trickery and treachery the two strange princes had used, he grew very angry and had them driven ignominously forth from the castle. ",26116,26279
291,"But he received the brave youth with great honor, as he had deserved, and he was married to the king's youngest daughter that selfsame day. ",26279,26419
292,"After the king's death the youth was chosen king of all the land, and a gallant king he was. ",26419,26512
293,"And there he lives with his beautiful queen, and is reigning there happily to this very day. ",26512,26605
294,And that is all I have to do with it.,26605,26643
