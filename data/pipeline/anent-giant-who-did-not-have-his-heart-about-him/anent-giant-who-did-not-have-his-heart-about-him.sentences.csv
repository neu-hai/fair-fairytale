0,ONCE upon a time there was a king who had seven sons. ,0,54
1,He was so fond of them that he never could bear to have them all away from him at once. ,54,142
2,One of them always had to stay with him. ,142,183
3,"When they had grown up, six of them were to go forth and look for wives. ",183,256
4,"The youngest the king wanted to keep at home, and the others were to bring along a bride for him. ",256,354
5,"The king gave the six the handsomest clothes that had ever been seen, clothes that glittered from afar. ",354,458
6,"Each received a horse that had cost many hundred dollars, and so they set forth. ",458,539
7,"And after they had been at the courts of many kings, and had seen many princesses, they at last came to a king who had six daughters. ",539,673
8,Such beautiful princesses they had not as yet met with. ,673,729
9,"Each of them paid court to one of them, and when each had won his sweetheart, they rode back home again. ",729,834
10,But they were so deeply in love with their brides that they altogether forgot they were also to bring back a princess for their young brother who had stayed at home. ,834,1000
11,"Now when they had already covered a good bit of the homeward road, they passed close to a steep cliff-side where the giants dwelt. ",1000,1131
12,"And a giant came out, looked at them, and turned them all to stone, princes and princesses. ",1131,1223
13,The king waited and waited for his six sons. ,1223,1268
14,"Though he waited and yearned, they did not come. ",1268,1317
15,"Then he grew very sad, and said that he would never really be happy again. ",1317,1392
16,"""If I did not have you,"" he told his youngest, ""I would not keep on living, so sad am I at having lost your brothers."" ",1392,1511
17,"""But I had already been thinking of asking your permission to set out and find my brothers again,"" said the youngest. ",1511,1629
18,"""No, that I will not allow under any circumstances,"" answered the father, ""otherwise you will be lost to me into the bargain."" ",1629,1756
19,"But the youth's mind was set on going, and he pleaded so long that finally the king had to let him have his way. ",1756,1869
20,"Now the king had only a wretched old nag for him, since the six other princes and their suite had been given all the good horses. ",1869,1999
21,That did not worry the youngest. ,1999,2032
22,"He mounted the shabby old nag, and ""Farewell, father!"" ",2032,2087
23,he said to the king. ,2087,2108
24,"""I will surely return, and perhaps I will bring my six brothers back with me."" ",2108,2187
25,And with that he rode off. ,2187,2214
26,Now when he had ridden a while he met a raven. ,2214,2261
27,"He was lying in the road beating his wings, and unable to move from the spot because he was so starved. ",2261,2365
28,"""O, dear friend, if you will give me a bite to eat, then I'll help you in your hour of direst need!"" ",2365,2466
29,cried the raven. ,2466,2483
30,"""I have not much food, nor are you likely to be able to help me much,"" said the king's son, ""but still I can give you a little, for it is easy to see you need it."" ",2483,2647
31,And with that he gave the raven some of the provisions he had with him. ,2647,2719
32,"And when he had ridden a while longer, he came to a brook. ",2719,2778
33,"There lay a great salmon who had gotten on dry land, and was threshing about, and could not get back into the water. ",2778,2895
34,"""O, dear friend, help me back into the water,"" said the salmon to the king's son, ""and I will help you, too, in your hour of greatest need!"" ",2895,3036
35,"""The help you will be able to give me will probably not amount to much,"" said the prince, ""but it would be a pity if you had to lie there and pine away."" ",3036,3190
36,And with that he pushed the fish back into the water. ,3190,3244
37,"Then he rode on a long, long way, and met a wolf. ",3244,3294
38,"The wolf was so starved that he lay in the middle of the road, and writhed with hunger. ",3294,3382
39,"""Dear friend, let me eat your horse,"" said the wolf. ",3382,3435
40,"""My hunger is so great that my very inwards rattle, because I have had nothing to eat for the past two years!"" ",3435,3546
41,"""No,"" said the prince, ""I cannot do that: first I met a raven, and had to give him my provisions; ",3546,3644
42, then I met a salmon and had to help him back into the water; ,3643,3705
43, and now you want my horse. ,3704,3732
44,"That will not do, for what shall I ride on then?"" ",3732,3782
45,"""Well, my dear friend, you must help me,"" was the wolf's reply. ",3782,3846
46,"""You can ride on me. ",3846,3867
47,"I will help you in turn in your hour of greatest need."" ",3867,3923
48,"""The help you might give me would probably not amount to much; ",3923,3986
49," but I will let you eat the horse, since you are in such sorry case,"" returned the prince. ",3985,4076
50,"And when the wolf had eaten the horse, the prince took the bit and put it in the wolf's mouth, and fastened the saddle on his back. ",4076,4208
51,His meal had made the wolf so strong that he trotted off with the king's son as fast as he could. ,4208,4306
52,He had never ridden so swiftly before. ,4306,4345
53,"""When we have gone a little further I will show you the place where the giants live,"" said the wolf. ",4345,4446
54,In a short time they were there. ,4446,4479
55,"""Well, this is where the giants live,"" said the wolf. ",4479,4533
56,"""There you see your six brothers, whom the giant turned into stone, and yonder are their six brides. ",4533,4634
57,"Up there is the door through which you must pass."" ",4634,4685
58,"""No, I would not dare do that,"" said the king's son. ",4685,4738
59,"""He would murder me."" ",4738,4760
60,"""O no,"" was the wolf's reply, ""when you go in you will find a princess, and she will tell you how to set about getting rid of the giant. ",4760,4897
61,"You need only do as she says."" ",4897,4928
62,"And the prince went in, though he was afraid. ",4928,4974
63,When he entered the house the giant was not there. ,4974,5025
64,"In one of the rooms sat a princess, just as the wolf had said, and such a beautiful maiden the youth had never seen. ",5025,5142
65,"""Now may God help you, how did you get in here?"" ",5142,5191
66,"cried the princess, when she saw him. ",5191,5229
67,"""It is certain death for you. ",5229,5259
68,"No one can kill the giant who lives here, for he hasn't his heart about him."" ",5259,5337
69,"""Well, since I do happen to be here, I will at least make the attempt,"" said the prince. ",5337,5426
70,"""And I want to try to deliver my brothers, who stand outside, turned to stone, and I would like to save you as well."" ",5426,5544
71,"""Well, if you insist upon it, we must see what we can do,"" replied the princess. ",5544,5625
72,"""Now you must crawl under the bed here, and must listen carefully when I talk to the giant. ",5625,5717
73,"But you must not make a sound."" ",5717,5749
74,"The prince slipped under the bed, and no sooner was he there than the giant came home. ",5749,5836
75,"""Hu, it smells like the flesh of a Christian here!"" ",5836,5888
76,he cried. ,5888,5898
77,"""Yes,"" said the princess, ""a jackdaw flew by with a human bone, and let it fall down the chimney. ",5898,5996
78,"I threw it out again at once, but the odor does not disappear so quickly."" ",5996,6071
79,Then the giant said no more about it. ,6071,6109
80,"Toward evening he went to bed, but after he had lain there a while, the princess, who sat looking out of the window, said: ""There is something I would have asked you about long ago, if only I had dared."" ",6109,6313
81,"""And what may that be?"" ",6313,6337
82,inquired the giant. ,6337,6357
83,"""I would like to know where you keep your heart, since you do not have it about you?"" ",6357,6443
84,said the princess. ,6443,6462
85,"""O, that is something you need not ask about; ",6462,6508
86," at any rate, it lies under the threshold of the door,"" was the giant's reply. ",6507,6586
87,"""Aha,"" thought the prince under the bed, ""that is where we will find it!"" ",6586,6660
88,"The next morning the giant got up very early, and went into the forest. ",6660,6732
89,No sooner had he gone than the prince and the king's daughter set about looking for the heart under the threshold of the door. ,6732,6859
90,Yet no matter how much they dug and searched they found nothing. ,6859,6924
91,"""This time he has fooled us,"" said the princess. ",6924,6973
92,"""We'll have to try again."" ",6973,7000
93,"And she picked the loveliest flowers she could find and strewed them over the threshold which they had put to rights again and when the time drew near for the giant's return, the king's son crept under the bed once more. ",7000,7221
94,"When he was beneath it, the giant came. ",7221,7261
95,"""Hu hu, I smell human flesh!"" ",7261,7291
96,he cried. ,5888,5898
97,"""Yes,"" said the princess. ",7301,7327
98,"""A jackdaw flew by with a human bone in her beak, and she let it fall down the chimney. ",7327,7415
99,"I threw it out at once, but I suppose one can still smell it."" ",7415,7478
100,"Then the giant held his tongue, and said no more about it. ",7478,7537
101,After a time he asked who had strewn the flowers over the threshold. ,7537,7606
102,"""O, I did that,"" said the princess. ",7606,7642
103,"""What does it mean?"" ",7642,7663
104,the giant then asked. ,7663,7685
105,"""O, I am so fond of you that I had to do it, because I know that is where your heart lies."" ",7685,7777
106,"""Yes, of course,"" said the giant, ""but it does not happen to lie there at all."" ",7777,7857
107,"When he had gone to bed, the princess sat looking out of the window. ",7857,7926
108,"She again asked the giant where he kept his heart, for she was so fond of him, said she, that she wanted to know above all things. ",7926,8057
109,"""O, it is in the wardrobe there by the wall,"" said the giant. ",8057,8119
110,"""Aha,"" thought the king's son under the bed, ""that is where we will find it!"" ",8119,8197
111,"The next morning the giant got up early, and went into the forest. ",8197,8264
112,No sooner had he gone than the prince and the king's daughter set about looking for his heart in the wardrobe. ,8264,8375
113,"Yet no matter how much they looked, they did not find it. ",8375,8433
114,"""Well, well,"" said the princess, ""we will have to try once more."" ",8433,8499
115,"Then she adorned the wardrobe with flowers and wreaths, and toward evening the king's youngest son again crawled under the bed. ",8499,8627
116,"Then the giant came: ""Hu hu, it smells of human flesh here!"" ",8627,8688
117,he cried. ,5888,5898
118,"""Yes,"" said the princess. ",7301,7327
119,"""A jackdaw just this moment flew by with a human bone in her beak, and she let it fall down the chimney. ",8724,8829
120,"I threw it out again at once, but it may be that you can still smell it."" ",8829,8903
121,"When the giant heard this, he had nothing further to say about it. ",8903,8970
122,"But not long afterward he noticed that the wardrobe was adorned with flowers and wreaths, and asked who had done it. ",8970,9087
123,"""I,"" said the princess. ",9087,9111
124,"""What do you mean by such tomfoolery?"" ",9111,9150
125,asked the giant. ,9150,9167
126,"""O, I am so fond of you that I had to do it, since I know that is where your heart lies,"" was the reply of the princess. ",9167,9288
127,"""Are you really so stupid as to believe that?"" ",9288,9335
128,cried the giant. ,9335,9352
129,"""Yes, surely, I must believe it,"" said the princess, ""when you tell me so."" ",9352,9428
130,"""How silly you are,"" said the giant, ""you could never reach the place where I keep my heart."" ",9428,9522
131,"""But still I would like to know where it is,"" answered the princess. ",9522,9591
132,"Then the giant could no longer resist, and at last had to tell her the truth. ",9591,9669
133,"""Far, far away, in a lake there lies an island,"" said he, ""and on the island stands a church, and in the church there is a well, and in the well floats a duck, and in the duck there is an egg, and in the egg it is my heart!"" ",9669,9894
134,"The next morning, before dawn, the giant went to the forest again. ",9894,9961
135,"""Well, now I must get under way,"" said the prince, ""and it is a way I wish I could find."" ",9961,10051
136,"So he said farewell to the princess for the time being, and when he stepped out of the door, the wolf was standing there waiting for him. ",10051,10189
137,"He told him what had happened at the giant's, and said that now he would go to the well in the church, if only he knew the way. ",10189,10317
138,The wolf told him to climb on his back. ,10317,10357
139,"He would manage to find the way, said he. ",10357,10399
140,"And then they were off as though they had wings, over rock and wood, over hill and dale. ",10399,10488
141,"After they had been underway for many, many days, they at last reached the lake. ",10488,10569
142,Then the king's son did not know how they were to get across. ,10569,10631
143,"But the wolf told him not to worry, and swam across with the prince to the island. ",10631,10714
144,Then they came to the church. ,10714,10744
145,"But the church-key hung high up in the tower, and at first the king's son did not at all know how they were to get it down. ",10744,10868
146,"""You must call the raven,"" said the wolf, and that is what the king's son did. ",10868,10947
147,"And the raven came at once, and flew right down with the key, and now the prince could enter the church. ",10947,11052
148,"Then, when he came to the well, there was the duck, sure enough, swimming about as the giant had said. ",11052,11155
149,"He stood by the well and called the duck, and at last he lured her near him, and seized her. ",11155,11248
150,"But at the moment he grasped her and lifted her out of the water, she let the egg fall into the well. ",11248,11350
151,Now the prince again did not know how he was to get hold of it. ,11350,11414
152,"""Well, you must call the salmon,"" said the wolf. ",11414,11463
153,"That is what the king's son did, and the salmon came at once, and brought up the egg from the bottom of the well. ",11463,11577
154,Then the wolf told him to squeeze the egg a little. ,11577,11629
155,"And when the prince squeezed, the giant cried out. ",11629,11680
156,"""squeeze it again!"" ",11680,11700
157,"said the wolf, and when the prince did so, the giant cried out far more dolefully, and fearfully and tearfully begged for his life. ",11700,11832
158,"He would do all the king's son asked him to, said he, if only he would not squeeze his heart in two. ",11832,11933
159,"""Tell him to give back their original form to your six brothers, whom he turned to stone, and to their brides, as well; ",11933,12053
160," and that then you will spare his life,"" said the wolf, and the prince did so. ",12052,12131
161,"The troll at once agreed, and changed the six brothers into princes, and their brides into kings' daughters. ",12131,12240
162,"""Now squash the egg!"" ",12240,12262
163,cried the wolf. ,12262,12278
164,"Then the prince squeezed the egg in two, and the giant burst into pieces. ",12278,12352
165,"When the king's youngest son had put an end to the giant in this way, he rode back on his wolf to the giant's home. ",12352,12468
166,"There stood his six brothers as much alive as ever they had been, together with, their brides. ",12468,12563
167,"Then the prince went into the hill to get his own bride, and they all rode home together. ",12563,12653
168,"And great was the joy of the old king when his seven sons all returned, each with his bride. ",12653,12746
169,"""But the bride of my youngest is the most beautiful, after all, and he shall sit with her at the head of the table!"" ",12746,12863
170,said the king. ,12863,12878
171,"And then they had a feast that lasted for weeks, and if they have not stopped, they are feasting to this very day.",12878,12993
