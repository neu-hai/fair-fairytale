0,"In a country, far across the sea, there once dwelt a great and mighty Prince. ",0,78
1,"He lived in a grand Castle, which was full of beautiful furniture, and curious and rare ornaments. ",78,177
2,"And among them was a lovely little glass shoe, which would only fit the tiniest foot imaginable. ",177,274
3,"And as the Prince was looking at it one day, it struck him what a dainty little lady she would need to be who wore such a very small shoe. ",274,413
4,"And, as he liked dainty people, he made up his mind that he would never marry until he found a maiden who could wear the shoe, and that, when he found her, he would ask her to be his wife. ",413,602
5,"And he called all his Lords and Courtiers to him, and told them of the determination that he had come to, and asked them to help him in his quest. ",602,749
6,"And after they had taken counsel together they summoned a trusty Knight, and appointed him the Prince's Ambassador; ",749,865
7," and told him to take the slipper, and mount a fleet-footed horse, and ride up and down the whole of the Kingdom until he found a lady whom it would fit. ",864,1018
8,So the Ambassador put the little shoe carefully in his pocket and set out on his errand. ,1018,1107
9,"He rode, and he rode, and he rode, going to every town and castle that came in his way, and summoning all the ladies to appear before him to try on the shoe. ",1107,1265
10,"And, as he caused a Proclamation to be made that whoever could wear it should be the Prince's Bride, I need not tell you that all the ladies in the country-side flocked to wherever the Ambassador chanced to be staying, and begged leave to try on the slipper. ",1265,1524
11,"But they were all disappointed, for not one of them, try as she would, could make her foot small enough to go into the Fairy Shoe; ",1524,1655
12," and there were many bitter tears shed in secret, when they returned home, by countless fair ladies who prided themselves on the smallness of their feet, and who had set out full of lively expectation that they would be the successful competitors. ",1654,1902
13,At last the Ambassador arrived at a house where a well-to-do Laird had lived. ,1902,1980
14,"But the Laird was dead now, and there was nobody left but his wife and two daughters, who had grown poor of late, and who had to work hard for their living. ",1980,2137
15,One of the daughters was haughty and insolent; ,2137,2184
16," the other was little, and young, and modest, and sweet. ",2183,2240
17,"When the Ambassador rode into the courtyard of this house, and, holding out the shoe, asked if there were any fair ladies there who would like to try it on, the elder sister, who always thought a great deal of herself, ran forward, and said that she would do so, while the younger girl just shook her head and went on with her work. ",2240,2573
18,"""For,"" said she to herself, ""though my feet are so little that they might go into the slipper, what would I do as the wife of a great Prince? ",2573,2715
19,"Folk would just laugh at me, and say that I was not fit for the position. ",2715,2789
20,"No, no, I am far better to bide as I am."" ",2789,2831
21,"So the Ambassador gave the glass shoe to the elder sister, who carried it away to her own room; ",2831,2927
22," and presently, to every one's astonishment, came back wearing it on her foot. ",2926,3005
23,"It is true that her face was very white, and that she walked with a little limp; ",3005,3086
24," but no one noticed these things except her younger sister, and she only shook her wise little head, and said nothing. ",3085,3204
25,"The Prince's Ambassador was delighted that he had at last found a wife for his master, and he mounted his horse and rode off at full speed to tell him the good news. ",3204,3370
26,"When the Prince heard of the success of his errand, he ordered all his Courtiers to be ready to accompany him next day when he went to bring home his Bride. ",3370,3527
27,"You can fancy what excitement there was at the Laird's house when the gallant company arrived, with their Prince at their head, to greet the lady who was to be their Princess. ",3527,3703
28,"The old mother and the plain-looking maid-of-all-work ran hither and thither, fetching such meat and drink as the house could boast to set before their high-born visitors, while the bonnie little sister went and hid herself behind a great pot which stood in the corner of the courtyard, and which was used for boiling hen's meat. ",3703,4033
29,She knew that her foot was the smallest in the house; ,4033,4087
30, and something told her that if the Prince once got a glimpse of her he would not be content till she had tried on the slipper. ,4086,4214
31,"Meanwhile, the selfish elder sister did not help at all, but ran up to her chamber, and decked herself out in all the fine clothes that she possessed before she came downstairs to meet the Prince. ",4214,4411
32,"And when all the Knights and Courtiers had drunk a stirrup-cup, and wished Good Luck to their Lord and his Bride, she was lifted up behind the Prince on his horse, and rode off so full of her own importance, that she even forgot to say good-bye to her mother and sister. ",4411,4682
33,Alas! ,4682,4688
34,alas! ,4688,4694
35,pride must have a fall. ,4694,4718
36,"For the cavalcade had not proceeded very far when a little bird which was perched on a branch of a bush by the roadside sang out: ""Nippit fit, and clippit fit, behind the King rides, But pretty fit, and little fit, ahint the caldron hides."" ",4718,4959
37,"""What is this that the birdie says?"" ",4959,4996
38,"cried the Prince, who, if the truth be told, did not feel altogether satisfied with the Bride whom fortune had bestowed upon him. ",4996,5126
39,"""Do you have another sister, Madam?"" ",5126,5163
40,"""Only a little one,"" murmured the lady, who liked ill the way in which things seemed to be falling out. ",5163,5267
41,"""We will go back and find her,"" said the Prince firmly, ""for when I sent out the slipper I had no mind that its wearer should nip her foot, and clip her foot, in order to get it on."" ",5267,5450
42,So the whole party turned back; ,5450,5482
43, and when they reached the Laird's house the Prince ordered a search to be made in the courtyard. ,5481,5579
44,"And the bonnie little sister was soon discovered and brought out, all blushes and confusion, from her hiding-place behind the caldron. ",5579,5714
45,"""Give her the slipper, and let her try it on,"" said the Prince, and the eldest sister was forced to obey. ",5714,5820
46,"And what was the horror of the bystanders, as she drew it off, to see that she had cut off the tops of her toes in order to get it on. ",5820,5955
47,"But it fitted her little sister's foot exactly, without either paring or clipping; ",5955,6038
48," and when the Prince saw that it was so, he lifted the elder sister down from his horse and lifted the little one up in her place, and carried her home to his Palace, where the wedding was celebrated with great rejoicing; ",6037,6259
49, and for the rest of their lives they were the happiest couple in the whole kingdom.,6258,6343
