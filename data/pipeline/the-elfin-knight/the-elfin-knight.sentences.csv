0,"There is a lone moor in Scotland, which, in times past, was said to be haunted by an Elfin Knight. ",0,99
1,"This Knight was only seen at rare intervals, once in every seven years or so, but the fear of him lay on all the country round, for every now and then someone would set out to cross the moor and would never be heard of again. ",99,325
2,"And although men might search every inch of the ground, no trace of him would be found, and with a thrill of horror the searching party would go home again, shaking their heads and whispering to one another that he had fallen into the hands of the dreaded Knight. ",325,589
3,"So, as a rule, the moor was deserted, for nobody dare pass that way, much less live there; ",589,680
4," and by and by it became the haunt of all sorts of wild animals, which made their lairs there, as they found that they never were disturbed by mortal huntsmen. ",679,839
5,"Now in that same region lived two young earls, Earl St. Clair and Earl Gregory, who were such friends that they rode, and hunted, and fought together, if need be. ",839,1002
6,"And as they were both very fond of the chase, Earl Gregory suggested one day that they should go a-hunting on the haunted moor, in spite of the Elfin King. ",1002,1158
7,"""Certes, I hardly believe in him at all,"" cried the young man, with a laugh. ",1158,1235
8,"""Methinks it is but an old wife's tale to frighten the bairns withal, lest they go straying amongst the heather and lose themselves. ",1235,1368
9,"And it is pity that such fine sport should be lost because we--two bearded men--pay heed to such gossip."" ",1368,1474
10,But Earl St. Clair looked grave. ,1474,1507
11,"""It is ill meddling with unchancy things,"" he answered, ""and it is no bairn's tale that travellers have set out to cross that moor who have vanished bodily, and never mair been heard of; ",1507,1694
12," but it is, as thou sayest, a pity that so much good sport be lost, all because an Elfin Knight choosest to claim the land as his, and make us mortals pay toll for the privilege of planting a foot upon it. ",1693,1899
13,"""I have heard tell, however, that one is safe from any power that the Knight may have if one wearest the Sign of the Blessed Trinity. ",1899,2033
14,"So let us bind That on our arm and ride forth without fear."" ",2033,2094
15,Sir Gregory burst into a loud laugh at these words. ,2094,2146
16,"""Dost thou think that I am one of the bairns,"" he said, ""first to be frightened by an idle tale, and then to think that a leaf of clover will protect me? ",2146,2300
17,"No, no, carry that Sign if thou wilt; ",2300,2338
18," I will trust to my good bow and arrow."" ",2337,2378
19,"But Earl St. Clair did not heed his companion's words, for he remembered how his mother had told him, when he was a little lad at her knee that whoso carried the Sign of the Blessed Trinity need never fear any spell that might be thrown over him by Warlock or Witch, Elf or Demon. ",2378,2659
20,"So he went out to the meadow and plucked a leaf of clover, which he bound on his arm with a silken scarf; ",2659,2765
21, then he mounted his horse and rode with Earl Gregory to the desolate and lonely moorland. ,2764,2855
22,For some hours all went well; ,2855,2885
23, and in the heat of the chase the young men forgot their fears. ,2884,2948
24,Then suddenly both of them reined in their steeds and sat gazing in front of them with affrighted faces. ,2948,3053
25,"For a horseman had crossed their track, and they both would fain have known who he was and whence he came. ",3053,3160
26,"""By my troth, but he rideth in haste, whoever he may be,"" said Earl Gregory at last, ""and though I always thought that no steed on earth could match mine for swiftness, I reckon that for every league that mine goeth, his would go seven. ",3160,3397
27,"Let us follow him, and see from what part of the world he cometh."" ",3397,3464
28,"""The Lord forbid that thou shouldst stir thy horse's feet to follow him,"" said Earl St. Clair devoutly. ",3464,3568
29,"""Why, man, it is the Elfin Knight! ",3568,3603
30,"Canst thou not see that he doth not ride on the solid ground, but flieth through the air, and that, although he rideth on what seemeth a mortal steed, he is really craried by mighty pinions, which cleave the air like those of a bird? ",3603,3837
31,Follow him forsooth! ,3837,3858
32,"It will be an evil day for thee when thou seekest to do that."" ",3858,3921
33,"But Earl St. Clair forgot that he carried a Talisman which his companion lacked, that enabled him to see things as they really were, while the other's eyes were holden, and he was startled and amazed when Earl Gregory said sharply, ""Thy mind hath gone mad over this Elfin King. ",3921,4199
34,"I tell thee he who passed was a goodly Knight, clad in a green vesture, and riding on a great black jennet. ",4199,4307
35,"And because I love a gallant horseman, and would fain learn his name and degree, I will follow him till I find him, even if it be at the world's end."" ",4307,4458
36,"And without another word he put spurs to his horse and galloped off in the direction which the mysterious stranger had taken, leaving Earl St. Clair alone upon the moorland, his fingers touching the sacred Sign and his trembling lips muttering prayers for protection. ",4458,4726
37,"For he knew that his friend had been bewitched, and he made up his mind, brave gentleman that he was, that he would follow him to the world's end, if need be, and try to deliver him from the spell that had been cast over him. ",4726,4952
38,"Meanwhile Earl Gregory rode on and on, ever following in the wake of the Knight in green, over moor, and burn, and moss, till he came to the most desolate region that he had ever been in in his life; ",4952,5152
39," where the wind blew cold, as if from snow-fields, and where the hoar-frost lay thick and white on the withered grass at his feet. ",5151,5282
40,"And there, in front of him, was a sight from which mortal man might well shrink back in awe and dread. ",5282,5385
41,"For he saw an enormous Ring marked out on the ground, inside of which the grass, instead of being withered and frozen, was lush, and rank, and green, where hundreds of shadowy Elfin figures were dancing, clad in loose transparent robes of dull blue, which seemed to curl and twist round their wearers like snaky wreaths of smoke. ",5385,5715
42,"These weird Goblins were shouting and singing as they danced, and waving their arms above their heads, and throwing themselves about on the ground, for all the world as if they had gone mad; ",5715,5906
43, and when they saw Earl Gregory halt on his horse just outside the Ring they beckoned to him with their skinny fingers. ,5905,6025
44,"""Come hither, come hither,"" they shouted; ",6025,6067
45," ""come tread a measure with us, and afterwards we will drink to thee out of our Monarch's loving cup."" ",6066,6169
46,"And, strange as it may seem, the spell that had been cast over the young Earl was so powerful that, in spite of his fear, he felt that he must obey the eldrich summons, and he threw his bridle on his horse's neck and prepared to join them. ",6169,6409
47,But just then an old and grizzled Goblin stepped out from among his companions and approached him. ,6409,6508
48,"Apparently he dare not leave the charmed Circle, for he stopped at the edge of it; ",6508,6591
49," then, stooping down and pretending to pick up something, he whispered in a hoarse whisper: ""I know not whom thou art, nor from whence thou comest, Sir Knight, but if thou lovest thy life, see to it that thou comest not within this Ring, nor joinest with us in our feast. ",6590,6862
50,"Else wilt thou be for ever undone."" ",6862,6898
51,But Earl Gregory only laughed. ,6898,6929
52,"""I vowed that I would follow the Green Knight,"" he replied, ""and I will carry out my vow, even if the venture leadeth me close to the nethermost world."" ",6929,7082
53,"And with these words he stepped over the edge of the Circle, right in amongst the ghostly dancers. ",7082,7181
54,"At his coming they shouted louder than ever, and danced more madly, and sang more lustily; ",7181,7272
55," then, all at once, a silence fell upon them, and they parted into two companies, leaving a way through their midst, up which they signed to the Earl to pass. ",7271,7430
56,He walked through their ranks till he came to the middle of the Circle; ,7430,7502
57," and there, seated at a table of red marble, was the Knight whom he had come so far to seek, clad in his grass-green robes. ",7501,7625
58,"And before him, on the table, stood a wondrous goblet, fashioned from an emerald, and set round the rim with blood-red rubies. ",7625,7752
59,"And this cup was filled with heather ale, which foamed up over the brim; ",7752,7825
60," and when the Knight saw Sir Gregory, he lifted it from the table, and handed it to him with a stately bow, and Sir Gregory, being very thirsty, drank. ",7824,7976
61,"And as he drank he noticed that the ale in the goblet never grew less, but ever foamed up to the edge; ",7976,8079
62," and for the first time his heart misgave him, and he wished that he had never set out on this strange adventure. ",8078,8192
63,"But, alas! ",8192,8203
64,"the time for regrets had passed, for already a strange numbness was stealing over his limbs, and a chill pallor was creeping over his face, and before he could utter a single cry for help the goblet dropped from his nerveless fingers, and he fell down before the Elfin King like a dead man. ",8203,8494
65,Then a great shout of triumph went up from all the company; ,8494,8554
66," for if there was one thing which filled their hearts with joy, it was to entice some unwary mortal into their Ring and throw their uncanny spell over him, so that he must needs spend long years in their company. ",8553,8766
67,"But soon their shouts of triumphs began to die away, and they muttered and whispered to each other with looks of something like fear on their faces. ",8766,8915
68,For their keen ears heard a sound which filled their hearts with dread. ,8915,8987
69,"It was the sound of human footsteps, which were so free and untrammelled that they knew at once that the stranger, whoever he was, was as yet untouched by any charm. ",8987,9153
70,"And if this were so he might work them ill, and rescue their captive from them. ",9153,9233
71,And what they dreaded was true; ,9233,9265
72," for it was the brave Earl St. Clair who approached, fearless and strong because of the Holy Sign he bore. ",9264,9371
73,"And as soon as he saw the charmed Ring and the eldrich dancers, he was about to step over its magic border, when the little grizzled Goblin who had whispered to Earl Gregory, came and whispered to him also. ",9371,9578
74,"""Alas! ",9578,9585
75,"alas!"" ",9585,9592
76,"he exclaimed, with a look of sorrow on his wrinkled face, ""hast thou come, as thy companion came, to pay thy toll of years to the Elfin King? ",9592,9734
77,Oh! ,9734,9738
78,"if thou hast wife or child behind thee, I beseech thee, by all that thou holdest sacred, to turn back ere it be too late."" ",9738,9861
79,"""Who art thou, and from whence hast thou come?"" ",9861,9909
80,"asked the Earl, looking kindly down at the little creature in front of him. ",9909,9985
81,"""I came from the country that thou hast come from,"" wailed the Goblin. ",9985,10056
82,"""For I was once a mortal man, even as thou. ",10056,10100
83,"But I set out over the enchanted moor, and the Elfin King appeared in the guise of a beauteous Knight, and he looked so brave, and noble, and generous that I followed him hither, and drank of his heather ale, and now I am doomed to bide here till seven long years be spent. ",10100,10374
84,"""As for thy friend, Sir Earl, he, too, hath drunk of the accursed draught, and he now lieth as dead at our lawful Monarch's feet. ",10374,10504
85,"He will wake up, it is true, but it will be in such a guise as I wear, and to the bondage with which I am bound."" ",10504,10618
86,"""Is there naught that I can do to rescue him!"" ",10618,10665
87,"cried Earl St. Clair eagerly, ""ere he taketh on him the Elfin shape? ",10665,10734
88,"I have no fear of the spell of his cruel captor, for I bear the Sign of One Who is stronger than he. ",10734,10835
89,"Speak speedily, little man, for time presseth."" ",10835,10883
90,"""There is something that thou couldst do, Sir Earl,"" whispered the Goblin, ""but to essay it were a desperate attempt. ",10883,11001
91,"For if thou failest, then could not even the Power of the Blessed Sign save thee."" ",11001,11084
92,"""And what is that?"" ",11084,11104
93,asked the Earl impatiently. ,11104,11132
94,"""Thou must remain motionless,"" answered the old man, ""in the cold and frost till dawn break and the hour cometh when they sing Matins in the Holy Church. ",11132,11286
95,"Then must thou walk slowly nine times round the edge of the enchanted Circle, and after that thou must walk boldly across it to the red marble table where sits the Elfin King. ",11286,11462
96,On it thou wilt see an emerald goblet studded with rubies and filled with heather ale. ,11462,11549
97,That must thou secure and carry away; ,11549,11587
98, but whilst thou art doing so let no word cross thy lips. ,11586,11644
99,"For this enchanted ground whereon we dance may look solid to mortal eyes, but in reality it is not so. ",11644,11747
100,"It is but a quaking bog, and under it is a great lake, wherein dwelleth a fearsome Monster, and if thou so much as utter a word while thy foot resteth upon it, thou wilt fall through the bog and perish in the waters beneath."" ",11747,11973
101,"So saying the Grisly Goblin stepped back among his companions, leaving Earl St. Clair standing alone on the outskirts of the charmed Ring. ",11973,12112
102,"There he waited, shivering with cold, through the long, dark hours, till the grey dawn began to break over the hill tops, and, with its coming, the Elfin forms before him seemed to dwindle and fade away. ",12112,12316
103,"And at the hour when the sound of the Matin Bell came softly pealing from across the moor, he began his solemn walk. ",12316,12433
104,"Round and round the Ring he paced, keeping steadily on his way, although loud murmurs of anger, like distant thunder, rose from the Elfin Shades, and even the very ground seemed to heave and quiver, as if it would shake this bold intruder from its surface. ",12433,12690
105,But through the power of the Blessed Sign on his arm Earl St. Clair went on unhurt. ,12690,12774
106,"When he had finished pacing round the Ring he stepped boldly on to the enchanted ground, and walked across it; ",12774,12885
107," and what was his astonishment to find that all the ghostly Elves and Goblins whom he had seen, were lying frozen into tiny blocks of ice, so that he was sore put to it to walk amongst them without treading upon them. ",12884,13102
108,"And as he approached the marble table the very hairs rose on his head at the sight of the Elfin King sitting behind it, stiff and stark like his followers; ",13102,13258
109," while in front of him lay the form of Earl Gregory, who had shared the same fate. ",13257,13340
110,"Nothing stirred, save two coal-black ravens, who sat, one on each side of the table, as if to guard the emerald goblet, flapping their wings, and croaking hoarsely. ",13340,13505
111,"When Earl St. Clair lifted the precious cup, they rose in the air and circled round his head, screaming with rage, and threatening to dash it from his hands with their claws; ",13505,13680
112," while the frozen Elves, and even their mighty King himself stirred in their sleep, and half sat up, as if to lay hands on this presumptuous intruder. ",13679,13830
113,"But the Power of the Holy Sign restrained them, else had Earl St. Clair been foiled in his quest. ",13830,13928
114,"As he retraced his steps, awesome and terrible were the sounds that he heard around him. ",13928,14017
115,"The ravens shrieked, and the frozen Goblins screamed; ",14017,14071
116," and up from the hidden lake below came the sound of the deep breathing of the awful Monster who was lurking there, eager for prey. ",14070,14202
117,"But the brave Earl heeded none of these things, but kept steadily onwards, trusting in the Might of the Sign he bore. ",14202,14320
118,And it carried him safely through all the dangers; ,14320,14371
119," and just as the sound of the Matin Bell was dying away in the morning air he stepped on to solid ground once more, and flung the enchanted goblet from him. ",14370,14527
120,And lo! ,14527,14535
121,"every one of the frozen Elves vanished, along with their King and his marble table, and nothing was left on the rank green grass save Earl Gregory, who slowly woke from his enchanted slumber, and stretched himself, and stood up, shaking in every limb. ",14535,14787
122,"He gazed vaguely round him, as if he scarce remembered where he was. ",14787,14856
123,"And when, after Earl St. Clair had run to him and had held him in his arms till his senses returned and the warm blood coursed through his veins, the two friends returned to the spot where Earl St. Clair had thrown down the wondrous goblet, they found nothing but a piece of rough grey whinstone, with a drop of dew hidden in a little crevice which was hollowed in its side.",14856,15231
