0,"Once upon a time there was a peasant who lived in Telemarken, and had a big farm; ",0,82
1," yet he had nothing but bad luck with his cattle, and at last lost his house and holding. ",81,171
2,"He had scarcely anything left, and with the little he had, he bought a bit of land that lay off to one side, far away from the city, in the wildwood and the wilderness. ",171,340
3,"One day, as he was passing through his farm-yard, he met a man. ",340,404
4,"""Good-day, neighbor!"" ",404,426
5,said the man. ,426,440
6,"""Good-day,"" said the peasant, ""I thought I was all alone here. ",440,503
7,"Are you a neighbor of mine?"" ",503,532
8,"""You can see my homestead over yonder,"" said the man. ",532,586
9,"""It is not far from your own."" ",586,617
10,"And there lay a farm-holding such as he had never before seen, handsome and prosperous, and in fine condition. ",617,728
11,Then he knew very well that this must be one of the underground people; ,728,800
12," yet he had no fear, but invited his neighbor in to drink a glass with him, and the neighbor seemed to enjoy it. ",799,912
13,"""Listen,"" said the neighbor, ""there is one thing you must do for me as a favor."" ",912,993
14,"""First let me know what it is,"" said the peasant. ",993,1043
15,"""You must shift your cow-stable, because it is in my way,"" was the answer he gave the peasant. ",1043,1138
16,"""No, I'll not do that,"" said the peasant. ",1138,1180
17,"""I put it up only this summer, and the winter is coming on. ",1180,1240
18,"What am I to do with my cattle then?"" ",1240,1278
19,"""Well, do as you choose; ",1278,1303
20," but if you do not tear it down, you will live to regret it,"" said his neighbor. ",1302,1383
21,And with that he went his way. ,1383,1414
22,"The peasant was surprised at this, and did not know what to do. ",1414,1478
23,"It seemed quite foolish to him to start in to tear down his stable when the long winter night was approaching, and besides, he could not count on help. ",1478,1630
24,"One day as he was standing in his stable, he sank through the ground. ",1630,1700
25,"Down below, in the place to which he had come, everything was unspeakably handsome. ",1700,1784
26,There was nothing which was not of gold or of silver. ,1784,1838
27,"Then the man who had called himself his neighbor came along, and bade him sit down. ",1838,1922
28,"After a time food was brought in on a silver platter, and mead in a silver jug, and the neighbor invited him to draw up to the table and eat. ",1922,2064
29,"The peasant did not dare refuse, and sat down at the table; ",2064,2124
30," but just as he was about to dip his spoon into the dish, something fell down into his food from above, so that he lost his appetite. ",2123,2257
31,"""Yes, yes,"" said the man, ""now you can see why we don't like your stable. ",2257,2331
32,"We can never eat in peace, for as soon as we sit down to a meal, dirt and straw fall down, and no matter how hungry we may be, we lose our appetites and cannot eat. ",2331,2496
33,"But if you will do me the favor to set up your stable elsewhere, you shall never go short of pasture nor good crops, no matter how old you may grow to be. ",2496,2651
34,"But if you won't, you shall know naught but lean years all your life long."" ",2651,2727
35,"When the peasant heard that, he went right to work pulling down his stable, to put it up again in another place. ",2727,2840
36,"Yet he could not have worked alone, for at night, when all slept, the building of the new stable went forward just as it did by day, and well he knew his neighbor was helping him. ",2840,3020
37,"Nor did he regret it later, for he had enough of feed and corn, and his cattle waxed fat. ",3020,3110
38,"Once there was a year of scarcity, and feed was so short that he was thinking of selling or slaughtering half his herd. ",3110,3230
39,"But one morning, when the milk-maid went into the stable, the dog was gone, and with him all the cows and the calves. ",3230,3348
40,She began to cry and told the peasant. ,3348,3387
41,"But he thought to himself, that it was probably his neighbor's doings, who had taken the cattle to pasture. ",3387,3495
42,"And sure enough, so it was; ",3495,3523
43," for toward spring, when the woods grew green, he saw the dog come along, barking and leaping, by the edge of the forest, and after him followed all the cows and calves, and the whole herd was so fat it was a pleasure to look at it.",3522,3755
