0,"In time past--we can not tell exactly how many, many years ago--a poor Indian was living, with his wife and children, in a beautiful part of the country. ",0,154
1,"He was not only poor, but he had the misfortune to be inexpert in procuring food for his family. ",154,251
2,His children were all too young to give him assistance. ,251,307
3,"Although of a lowly condition and straitened in his circumstances, he was a man of kind and contented disposition. ",307,422
4,He was always thankful to the Great Spirit for every thing he received. ,422,494
5,He even stood in the door of his lodge to bless the birds that flew past in the summer evenings. ,494,591
6,"Although, if he had been of a complaining temper, he might have repined that they were not rather spread upon the table for his evening meal. ",591,733
7,"The same gracious and sweet disposition was inherited by his eldest son, who had now arrived at the proper age to undertake the ceremony of the fast. ",733,883
8,This was to learn what kind of a spirit would be his guide and guardian through life. ,883,969
9,"Wunzh, for this was his name, had been an obedient boy from his infancy--pensive, thoughtful, and gentle--so that he was beloved by the whole family. ",969,1119
10,"As soon as the first buds of spring appeared, and the delicious fragrance of the young year began to sweeten the air, his father, with the help of his younger brothers, built for Wunzh the customary little lodge. ",1119,1332
11,"It was at a retired spot at some distance from their own, where he would not be disturbed during the solemn rite. ",1332,1446
12,"To prepare himself, Wunzh sought to clear his heart of every evil thought, and to think of nothing that was not good, and beautiful, and kindly. ",1446,1591
13,"That he might store his mind with pleasant ideas for his dreams, for the first few days he amused himself by walking in the woods and over the mountains, examining the early plants and flowers. ",1591,1785
14,"As he rambled far and wide, through the wild country, he felt a strong desire to know how the plants and herbs and berries grew, without any aid from man. ",1785,1940
15,"He wondered why it was that some kinds were good to eat, and that others were possessed of medicinal or poisonous power. ",1940,2061
16,"After he had become too weak to walk about, and confined himself strictly to the lodge, he recalled these thoughts, and turning them in his mind, he wished he could dream of something that would prove a benefit to his father and family, and to all others of his fellow-creatures. ",2061,2341
17,"""True,"" thought Wunzh, ""the Great Spirit made all things, and it is to him that we owe our lives. ",2341,2439
18,"Could he not make it easier for us to get our food, than by hunting animals and taking fish? ",2439,2532
19,"I must try to find this out in my visions."" ",2532,2576
20,"On the third day Wunzh became weak and faint, and kept his bed. ",2576,2640
21,"Suddenly he fancied, as he lay thus, that a bright light came in at the lodge door. ",2640,2724
22,"Before he was aware, he saw a handsome young man, with a complexion of the softest and purest white, coming down from the sky, and advancing toward him. ",2724,2877
23,"The beautiful stranger was richly and gayly dressed, having on a great many garments of green and yellow colors, but differing in their deeper or lighter shades. ",2877,3039
24,"He had a plume of waving feathers on his head, and all his motions were graceful. ",3039,3121
25,"He reminded Wunzh of the deep green of the summer grass, and the clear amber of the summer sky, and the gentle blowing of the summer wind. ",3121,3260
26,"Beautiful as the stranger was, he paused on a little mound of earth, just before the door of the lodge. ",3260,3364
27,"""I am sent to you, my friend,"" said this celestial visitor, in a voice most soft and musical to listen to. ",3364,3471
28,"""I am sent to you by that Great Spirit who made all things in the sky, and on the earth. ",3471,3560
29,He has seen and knows your motives in fasting. ,3560,3607
30,"He sees that it is from a kind and benevolent wish to do good to your people, and to procure a benefit for them. ",3607,3720
31,"He sees that you do not seek for strength in war, or the praise of the men of the bloody hand. ",3720,3815
32,"I am sent to instruct you and to show you how you can do your kindred good."" ",3815,3892
33,"He then told the young man to arise, and to prepare to wrestle with him. ",3892,3965
34,It was only by this means that he could hope to succeed in his wishes. ,3965,4036
35,"Wunzh knew how weak he was from fasting, but the voice of the stranger was cheery, and put such a courage in his heart, that he promptly sprang up, determined to die rather than fail. ",4036,4220
36,Brave Wunzh! ,4220,4233
37,"if you ever accomplish any thing, it will be through the power of the resolve that spoke within you at that moment. ",4233,4349
38,"He began the trial, and after a long-sustained struggle he was almost overpowered, when the beautiful stranger said: ""My friend, it is enough for once, I will come again to try you;""",4349,4531
39,""" and smiling on him, he returned through the air in the same direction in which he had come. ",4530,4624
40,"The next day, although he saw how sweetly the wild-flowers bloomed upon the slopes, and the birds warbled from the woodland, he longed to see the celestial visitor, and to hear his voice. ",4624,4812
41,"To his great joy he reappeared at the same hour, toward the going down of the sun, and re-challenged Wunzh to a trial of strength. ",4812,4943
42,"The brave Wunzh felt that his strength of body was even less than on the day before, but the courage of his mind seemed to grow. ",4943,5072
43,"Observing this, and how Wunzh put his whole heart in the struggle, the stranger again spoke to him in the words he used before, adding: ""To-morrow will be your last trial. ",5072,5244
44,"Be strong, my friend, for this is the only way in which you can overcome me and obtain the boon you seek."" ",5244,5351
45,The light which shone after him as he left Wunzh was brighter than before. ,5351,5426
46,On the third day he came again and renewed the struggle. ,5426,5483
47,"Very faint in body was poor Wunzh, but he was stronger at heart than ever, and determined to prevail now or perish. ",5483,5599
48,"He put forth his utmost powers, and after a contest more severe than either of the others, the stranger ceased his efforts, and declared himself conquered. ",5599,5755
49,For the first time he entered Wunzh's little fasting-lodge. ,5755,5815
50,"Sitting down beside the youth, he began to deliver his instructions to him and to inform him in what manner he should proceed to take advantage of his victory. ",5815,5975
51,"""You have won your desire of the Great Spirit,"" said the beautiful stranger. ",5975,6052
52,"""You have wrestled manfully. ",6052,6081
53,To-morrow will be the seventh day of your fasting. ,6081,6132
54,"Your father will give you food to strengthen you, and as it is the last day of trial you will prevail. ",6132,6235
55,"I know this, and now tell you what you must do to benefit your family and your people. ",6235,6322
56,"Tomorrow,"" he repeated, ""I shall meet you and wrestle with you for the last time. ",6322,6404
57,"As soon as you have prevailed against me, you will strip off my garments and throw me down, clean the earth of roots and weeds, make it soft, and bury me in the spot. ",6404,6571
58,"When you have done this, leave my body in the earth, and do not disturb it. ",6571,6647
59,"Come at times to visit the place, to see whether I have come to life. ",6647,6717
60,Above all be careful to never let the grass or weeds grow upon my grave. ,6717,6790
61,Once a month cover me with fresh earth. ,6790,6830
62,"If you follow these my instructions you will accomplish your object of doing good to your fellow-creatures by teaching them the knowledge I now teach you."" ",6830,6986
63,"He then shook Wunzh by the hand and disappeared, but he was gone so soon that Wunzh could not tell what direction he took. ",6986,7109
64,"In the morning, Wunzh's father came to his lodge with some slight refreshments, saying: ""My son, you have fasted long enough. ",7109,7235
65,"If the Great Spirit will favor you, he will do it now. ",7235,7290
66,"It is seven days since you have tasted food, and you must not sacrifice your life. ",7290,7373
67,"The Master of Life does not require that."" ",7373,7416
68,"""My father,"" replied Wunzh, ""wait till the sun goes down. ",7416,7474
69,"I have a particular reason for extending my fast to that hour."" ",7474,7538
70,"""Very well,"" said the old man, ""I shall wait till the hour arrives, and you shall be inclined to eat."" ",7538,7641
71,"At his usual hour of appearing, the beautiful sky-visitor returned, and the trial of strength was renewed. ",7641,7748
72,"Although he had not availed himself of his father's offer of food, Wunzh felt that new strength had been given him. ",7748,7864
73,His heart was mighty within him to achieve some great purpose. ,7864,7927
74,"Courage was like the eagle that spreads his wings within the tree-top for a great flight, within the bosom of the brave Wunzh. ",7927,8054
75,He grasped his angel challenger with supernatural strength and threw him down. ,8054,8133
76,"Mindful of his own instructions, he tore from him his beautiful garments and plume. ",8133,8217
77,"Finding him dead, he immediately buried him on the spot, using all the precautions he had been told of. ",8217,8321
78,"Very confident was Wunzh, all the time, that his friend would again come to life. ",8321,8403
79,"Wunzh now returned to his father's lodge, where he was warmly welcomed. ",8403,8475
80,"As it had been appointed to him during the days of his fasting to walk apart with Heaven, he was not permitted to see any human face save that of his father, the representative to the little household upon earth of the Good Father who is in Heaven. ",8475,8724
81,"Wunzh partook sparingly of the meal that had been prepared for him, and once more mingled in the cares and sports of the family. ",8724,8853
82,But he never for a moment forgot the grave of his friend. ,8853,8911
83,"He carefully visited it throughout the spring, and weeded out the grass, and kept the ground in a soft and pliant state. ",8911,9032
84,"Sometimes, when the brave Wunzh thought of his friend that was gone from his sight, he dropped a tear upon the earth where he lay. ",9032,9163
85,"Watching and tending, and moistening the earth with his tears, it was not long before Wunzh saw the tops of green plumes coming through the ground. ",9163,9311
86,"The more faithful he was in obeying his instructions in keeping the ground in order, and in cherishing the memory of his departed friend, the faster they grew. ",9311,9471
87,"He was, however, careful to conceal the charge of the earth which he had from his father. ",9471,9561
88,Days and weeks had passed in this way. ,9561,9600
89,"The summer was drawing toward a close, when one day, after a long absence in hunting, Wunzh invited his father to follow him to the quiet and lonesome spot of his former fast. ",9600,9776
90,"The little fasting-lodge had been removed, and the weeds kept from growing on the circle where it had stood. ",9776,9885
91,"In its place rose a tall and graceful plant, surmounted with nodding plumes and stately leaves, and golden clusters. ",9885,10002
92,"There was in its aspect and bearing the deep green of the summer grass, the clear amber of the summer sky, and the gentle blowing of the summer wind. ",10002,10152
93,"""It is my friend!"" ",10152,10171
94,"shouted Wunzh, ""it is the friend of all mankind. ",10171,10220
95,It is Mondawmin: it is our Indian Corn! ,10220,10260
96,"We need no longer rely on hunting alone, for as long as this gift is cherished and taken care of, the ground itself will give us a living."" ",10260,10400
97,He then pulled an ear. ,10400,10423
98,"""See, my father,"" said he, ""this is what I fasted for. ",10423,10478
99,"The Great Spirit has listened to my voice, and sent us something new, and henceforth our people will not alone depend upon the chase or upon the waters."" ",10478,10632
100,Wunzh then communicated to his father the instructions given to him by the stranger. ,10632,10717
101,"He told him that the broad husks must be torn away, as he had pulled off the garments in his wrestling. ",10717,10821
102,"Having done this, he directed him how the ear must be held before the fire till the outer skin became brown--as he complexion of his angel friend had been tinted by the sun--while all the milk was retained in the grain. ",10821,11041
103,"The whole family, in high spirits, and deeply grateful to the Merciful Master who gave it, assisted in a feast on the newly-grown ears of corn. ",11041,11185
104,"So came that mighty blessing into the world, and we owe all of those beautiful fields of healthful grain to the dream of the brave boy Wunzh.",11185,11327
