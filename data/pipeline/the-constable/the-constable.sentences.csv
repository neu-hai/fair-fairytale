0,In a city in the neighborhood of Kaiutschou there once lived a constable by the name of Dung. ,0,94
1,One day when he returned from a hunt after thieves the twilight had already begun to fall. ,94,185
2,"So before he waded through the stream that flowed through the city he sat down on the bank, lit a pipe and took off his shoes. ",185,312
3,"When he looked up, he suddenly saw a man in a red hat dressed as a constable crouching beside him. ",312,411
4,"Astonished, he inquired: ""Who are you? ",411,450
5,"Your clothes indicate that you are a member of our profession, but I have never yet seen you among the men of our local force. ",450,577
6,"Tell me, pray, whence you come?"" ",577,610
7,"The other answered: ""I am weary, having come a long journey, and would like to enjoy a pipeful of tobacco in your company. ",610,733
8,"I am sure you will not object to that."" ",733,773
9,Dung handed him a pipe and tobacco. ,773,809
10,"But the other constable said: ""I do not need them. ",809,860
11,Just you keep on smoking. ,860,886
12,"It is enough for me to enjoy the odor."" ",886,926
13,"So they chatted awhile together, and together waded through the stream. ",926,998
14,"And gradually they became quite confidential and the stranger said: ""I will be quite frank with you. ",998,1099
15,"I am the head constable of the Nether World, and am subject to the Lord of the Great Mountain. ",1099,1194
16,You yourself are a constable of reputation here in the upper world. ,1194,1262
17,"And, because of my skill, I have standing in the world below. ",1262,1324
18,"Since we are so well suited to each other, I should like to enter into a bond of brotherhood with you."" ",1324,1428
19,"Dung was agreeable and asked: ""But what really brings you here?"" ",1428,1493
20,"Said the other: ""In your district there lives a certain Wang, who was formerly superintendent of the granaries, and at that time caused the death of an officer. ",1493,1654
21,This man has now accused him in the Nether World. ,1654,1704
22,"The King of the Nether World cannot come to a decision in the case, and therefore has asked the Lord of the Great Mountain to settle it. ",1704,1841
23,The Lord of the Great Mountain has ordered that Wang's property and life be shortened. ,1841,1928
24,"First his property is to be sequestered here in the upper world, and then his soul is to be dragged to the nether one. ",1928,2047
25,I have been sent out by the Judge of the Dead to fetch him. ,2047,2107
26,"Yet the established custom is, when some one is sent for, that the constable has first to report to the god of the city. ",2107,2228
27,"The god of the city then issues a summons, and sends one of his own spirit constables to seize the soul and deliver it over to me. ",2228,2359
28,"Only then may I take it away with me."" ",2359,2398
29,Dung asked him further particulars; ,2398,2434
30," but the other merely said: ""Later on you will see it all for yourself."" ",2433,2506
31,"When they reached the city Dung invited his colleague to stay at his home, and entertained him with wine and food. ",2506,2621
32,But the other only talked and touched neither the goblet nor the chop-sticks. ,2621,2699
33,"Said Dung: ""In my haste I could not find any better meal for you. ",2699,2765
34,"I am afraid it is not good enough."" ",2765,2801
35,"But his guest replied: ""Oh no, I am already surfeited and satisfied! ",2801,2870
36,We spirits feed only on odors; ,2870,2901
37," in which respect we differ from men."" ",2900,2939
38,It was late at night before he set out to visit the temple of the city god. ,2939,3015
39,"No sooner did morning dawn than he reappeared to take farewell and said: ""Now all is in order: I am off! ",3015,3120
40,"In two years' time you will go to Taianfu, the city near the Great Mountain, and there we will meet again."" ",3120,3228
41,Dung began to feel ill at ease. ,3228,3260
42,"A few days later, in fact, came the news that Wang had died. ",3260,3321
43,The district mandarin journeyed to the dead man's natal village in order to express his sympathy. ,3321,3419
44,Among his followers was Dung. ,3419,3449
45,The inn-keeper there was a tenant of Wang's. ,3449,3494
46,"Dung asked him: ""Did anything out of the ordinary happen when Sir Wang died?"" ",3494,3572
47,"""It was all very strange,"" answered the inn-keeper, ""and my mother who had been very busy in his house, came home and fell into a violent fever. ",3572,3717
48,"She was unconscious for a day and a night, and could hardly breathe."" ",3717,3787
49,"She came to on the very day when the news of Sir Wang's death was made public, and said: 'I have been to the Nether World and I met him there. ",3787,3930
50,He had chains about his neck and several devils were dragging him along. ,3930,4003
51,"I asked him what he had done, but he said: ""I have no time to tell you now. ",4003,4079
52,"When you return ask my wife and she will tell you all!""' ",4079,4136
53,And yesterday my mother went there and asked her. ,4136,4186
54,"And Wang's wife told her with tears: 'My master was an official, but for a long time he did not make any head-way. ",4186,4301
55,"He was superintendent of the granaries in Nanking, and in the same city was a high officer, with whom my master became very intimate.' ",4301,4436
56,He always came to visit at our house and he and my master would talk and drink together. ,4436,4525
57,"One day my master said to him: ""We administrative mandarins have a large salary and a good income besides. ",4525,4632
58,"You are an officer, and have even reached the second step in rank, yet your salary is so small that you cannot possibly make it do. ",4632,4764
59,"Have you any other income aside from it?"" ",4764,4806
60,"The officer replied: ""We are such good friends that I know I can speak openly to you. ",4806,4892
61,We officers are compelled to find some additional sources of revenue in order that our pockets may not be altogether empty. ,4892,5016
62,When we pay our men we make a small percentage of gains on the exchange; ,5016,5089
63, and we also carry more soldiers on our rosters than there actually are present. ,5088,5169
64,"If we had to live on our salaries we would die of hunger!"" ",5169,5228
65,"When my husband heard him say this he could not rid himself of the idea that by disclosing these criminal proceedings the State would be indebted to him, and that it would surely aid his plans for advancement. ",5228,5438
66,"On the other hand, he reflected that it would not be right to abuse his friend's confidence. ",5438,5531
67,With these ideas in his mind he retired to his inner rooms. ,5531,5591
68,In the courtyard stood a round pavilion. ,5591,5632
69,"Lost in heavy thought, he crossed his hands behind his back, and for a long time walked round and round the pavilion. ",5632,5750
70,"Finally he said with a sigh: ""Charity begins at home; ",5750,5804
71," I will sacrifice my friend!"" ",5803,5833
72,"Then he drew up his report, in which the officer was indicted. ",5833,5896
73,"An imperial order was issued, the matter was investigated, and the officer was condemned to death. ",5896,5995
74,"My husband, however, was at once increased in rank, and from that time on advanced rapidly. ",5995,6087
75,And with the exception of myself no one ever knew anything of the matter. ,6087,6161
76,"When my mother told them of her encounter with Wang in the Nether World, the whole family burst into loud weeping. ",6161,6276
77,"Four tents full of Buddhist and Taoist priests were sent for, who fasted and read masses for thirty-five days in order that Wang might be delivered. ",6276,6425
78,"Whole mountains of paper money, silk and straw figures were burned, and the ceremonies have not as yet come to an end. ",6425,6544
79,When Dung heard this he was very much frightened. ,6544,6594
80,Two years later he received an order to journey to Taianfu in order to arrest some robbers there. ,6594,6692
81,"He thought to himself: ""My friend, the spirit, must be very powerful indeed, to have known about this trip so far in advance. ",6692,6818
82,I must inquire for him. ,6818,6842
83,"Perhaps I will see him again."" ",6842,6873
84,When he reached Taianfu he sought out an inn. ,6873,6919
85,"The inn-keeper received him with the words: ""Are you Master Dung, and have you come from the bay of Kaiutschou?"" ",6919,7032
86,"""I am the man,"" answered Dung, alarmed, ""how do you happen to know me?"" ",7032,7104
87,"The inn-keeper replied: ""The constable of the temple of the Great Mountain appeared to me last night and said: 'To-morrow a man by the name of Dung who is a good friend of mine is coming from the bay of Kaiutschou!' ",7104,7320
88,"And then he described your appearance and your clothes to me exactly, and told me to make careful note of them, and when you came to treat you with the greatest consideration, and to take no pay from you, since he would repay me lavishly. ",7320,7559
89,"So when I saw you coming everything was exactly as my dreams had foretold, and I knew you at once. ",7559,7658
90,"I have already prepared a quiet room for you, and beg that you will condescend to make yourself at ease."" ",7658,7764
91,"Joyfully Dung followed him, and the inn-keeper waited on him with the greatest consideration, and saw that he had great plenty to eat and to drink. ",7764,7912
92,At midnight the spirit arrived. ,7912,7944
93,"Without having opened the door, he stood by Dung's bedside, gave him his hand, and asked how things had gone with him since he had last seen him. ",7944,8090
94,Dung answered all his questions and thanked him into the bargain for appearing to the inn-keeper in a dream. ,8090,8199
95,He continued to live for some days at the inn. ,8199,8246
96,"During the day he went walking on the Great Mountain and at night his friend came to visit him and talked with him, and at the same time asked him what had happened to Sir Wang. ",8246,8424
97,"""His sentence has already been spoken,"" answered the other. ",8424,8484
98,"""This man pretended to be conscientious, and traitorously brought about the death of his friend. ",8484,8581
99,Of all sins there is no greater sin than this. ,8581,8628
100,"As a punishment he will be sent forth again into the world as an animal."" ",8628,8702
101,"Then he added: ""When you reach home you must take constant care of your health. ",8702,8782
102,Fate has allowed you seventy-eight years of mortal life. ,8782,8839
103,When your time is up I will come to fetch you myself. ,8839,8893
104,"Then I will see that you obtain a place as constable in the Nether World, where we can always be together."" ",8893,9001
105,"When he had said this, he disappeared.",9001,9040
