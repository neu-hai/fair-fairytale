0,"It chanced, long years ago, that a certain horse-dealer lived in the South of Scotland, near the Border. ",0,105
1,It was not very far from Longtown. ,105,140
2,He was known as Canonbie Dick. ,140,171
3,"As he went up and down the country, he almost always had a long string of horses behind him. ",171,264
4,"He bought them at one fair and sold at another, generally managing to turn a good big penny by the transaction. ",264,376
5,"He was a very fearless man, not easily daunted. ",376,424
6,"The people who knew him used to say that if Canonbie Dick dare not attempt a thing, no one else need be asked to do it. ",424,544
7,"One evening, he was returning from a fair at some distance from his home with a pair of horses which he had not succeeded in selling. ",544,678
8,"He was riding over Bowden Moor, which lies to the west of the Eildon Hills. ",678,754
9,"These hills are, as all men know, the scene of some of the most famous of Thomas the Rhymer's prophecies. ",754,860
10,"Also, so men say, they are the sleeping-place of King Arthur and his Knights, who rest under the three high peaks, waiting for the mystic call that shall awake them. ",860,1026
11,"But little recked the horse-dealer of Arthur and his Knights, nor yet of Thomas the Rhymer. ",1026,1118
12,"He was riding along at a snail's pace, thinking over the bargains which he had made at the fair that day. ",1118,1224
13,He was wondering when he was likely to dispose of his two remaining horses. ,1224,1300
14,"All at once he was startled by the approach of a venerable man, with white hair and an old-world dress, who seemed almost to start out of the ground, so suddenly did he make his appearance. ",1300,1490
15,"When they met, the stranger stopped. ",1490,1527
16,"To Canonbie Dick's great amazement, asked him for how much he would be willing to part with his horses. ",1527,1631
17,The wily horse-dealer thought that he saw a chance of driving a good bargain. ,1631,1709
18,The stranger looked a man of some consequence; ,1709,1756
19, so he named a good round sum. ,1755,1786
20,The old man tried to bargain with him; ,1786,1825
21, but when he found that he had not much chance of succeeding. ,1824,1886
22,No one ever did succeed in inducing Canonbie Dick to sell a horse for a less sum than he named for it at first. ,1886,1998
23,"He agreed to buy the animals, and, pulling a bag of gold from the pocket of his queerly cut breeches. ",1998,2100
24,He began to count out the price. ,2100,2133
25,"As he did so, Canonbie Dick got another shock of surprise. ",2133,2192
26,"The gold that the stranger gave him was not the gold that was in use at the time, but was fashioned into Unicorns, and Bonnet-pieces, and other ancient coins. ",2192,2351
27,It would be of no use to the horse-dealer in his everyday transactions. ,2351,2423
28,"But it was good, pure gold. ",2423,2451
29,He took it gladly. ,2451,2470
30,He knew that he was selling his horses at about half as much again as they were worth. ,2470,2557
31,"""So,"" thought he to himself, ""surely I cannot be the loser in the long run."" ",2557,2634
32,"Then the two parted, but not before the old man had commissioned Dick to get him other good horses at the same price. ",2634,2752
33,"The only stipulation he made being that Dick should always bring them to the same spot, after dark, and that he should always come alone. ",2752,2890
34,"And, as time went on, the horse-dealer found that he had indeed met a good customer. ",2890,2975
35,"For, whenever he came across a suitable horse, he had only to lead it over Bowden Moor after dark. ",2975,3074
36,"He was sure to meet the mysterious, white-headed stranger, who always paid him for the animal in old-fashioned golden pieces. ",3074,3200
37,"And he might have been selling horses to him yet, for aught I know, had it not been for his one failing. ",3200,3305
38,Canonbie Dick was apt to get very thirsty. ,3305,3348
39,"His ordinary customers, knowing this, took care always to provide him with something to drink. ",3348,3443
40,The old man never did so. ,3443,3469
41,He paid down his money and led away his horses. ,3469,3517
42,There was an end of the matter. ,3517,3549
43,"But one night, Dick, being even more thirsty than usual. ",3549,3606
44,He was feeling sure that his mysterious friend must live somewhere in the neighbourhood. ,3606,3695
45,He saw that he was always wandering about the hillside when everyone else was asleep. ,3695,3781
46,He hinted that he would be very glad to go home with him and have a little refreshment. ,3781,3869
47,"""He would need to be a brave man who asks to go home with me,"" returned the stranger; ",3869,3955
48," ""but, if thou wilt, thou canst follow me. ",3954,3997
49,"Only, remember this--if thy courage fail thee at that which thou wilt behold, thou wilt rue it all thy life."" ",3997,4107
50,Canonbie Dick laughed long and loud. ,4107,4144
51,"""My courage have never failed me yet,"" he cried. ",4144,4193
52,"""Beshrew me if I will let it fail now. ",4193,4232
53,"So lead on, old man, and I will follow."" ",4232,4273
54,Without a word the stranger turned and began to ascend a narrow path which led to a curious hillock. ,4273,4374
55,"From its shape, was called by the country-folk the ""Lucken Hare."" ",4374,4440
56,It was supposed to be a great haunt of Witches. ,4440,4488
57,"As a rule, nobody passed that way after dark, if they could possibly help it. ",4488,4566
58,Canonbie Dick was not afraid of Witches. ,4566,4607
59,He followed his guide with a bold step up the hillside. ,4607,4663
60,It must be confessed that he felt a little startled when he saw him turn down what seemed to be an entrance to a cavern. ,4663,4784
61,He never remembered having seen any opening in the hillside there before. ,4784,4858
62,"He paused for a moment, looking round him in perplexity, wondering where he was being taken. ",4858,4951
63,His conductor glanced at him scornfully. ,4951,4992
64,"""You can go back if you will,"" he said. ",4992,5032
65,"""I warned you thou were going on a journey that would try your courage to the uttermost."" ",5032,5122
66,There was a jeering note in his voice that touched Dick's pride. ,5122,5187
67,"""Who said that I was afraid?"" ",5187,5217
68,he retorted. ,5217,5230
69,"""I was just taking note of where this passage stands on the hillside, so as to know it another time."" ",5230,5332
70,The stranger shrugged his shoulders. ,5332,5369
71,"""Time enough to look for it when thou wouldst visit it again,"" he said. ",5369,5441
72,"And then he pursued his way, with Dick following closely at his heels. ",5441,5512
73,After the first yard or two they were enveloped in thick darkness. ,5512,5579
74,The horse-dealer would have been sore put to it to keep near his guide had not the latter held out his hand for him to grasp. ,5579,5705
75,"But after a little space a faint glimmering of light began to appear, which grew clearer and clearer. ",5705,5807
76,"At last they found themselves in an enormous cavern lit by flaming torches, which were stuck here and there in sconces in the rocky walls. ",5807,5946
77,"Although they served to give light enough to see by, yet threw such ghostly shadows on the floor that they only seemed to intensify the gloom that hung over the vast apartment. ",5946,6123
78,"And the curious thing about this mysterious cave was that, along one side of it, ran a long row of horse stalls, just like what one would find in a stable. ",6123,6279
79,"In each stall stood a coal-black charger, saddled and bridled, as if ready for the fray. ",6279,6368
80,"On the straw, by every horse's side, lay the gallant figure of a knight, clad from head to foot in coal-black armour, with a drawn sword in his mailed hand. ",6368,6525
81,"But not a horse moved, not a chain rattled. ",6525,6569
82,"Knights and steeds alike were silent and motionless, looking exactly as if some strange enchantment had been thrown over them. ",6569,6696
83,They had been suddenly turned into black marble. ,6696,6745
84,"There was something so awesome in the still, cold figures. ",6745,6804
85,"In the unearthly silence that brooded over everything that Canonbie Dick, reckless and daring though he was, felt his courage waning and his knees beginning to shake under him. ",6804,6981
86,"In spite of these feelings, however, he followed the old man up the hall to the far end of it. ",6981,7076
87,"There was a table of ancient workmanship, on which was placed a glittering sword and a curiously wrought hunting-horn. ",7076,7195
88,When they reached this table the stranger turned to him. ,7195,7252
89,"He said, with great dignity, ""Thou hast heard, good man, of Thomas of Ercildoune--Thomas the Rhymer, as men call him. ",7252,7370
90,"He who went to dwell for a time with the Queen of Fairy-land, and from her received the Gifts of Truth and Prophecy?"" ",7370,7488
91,Canonbie Dick nodded; ,7488,7510
92," for as the wonderful Soothsayer's name fell on his ears, his heart sank within him and his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth. ",7509,7651
93,"If he had been brought there to parley with Thomas the Rhymer, then had he laid himself open to all the eldrich Powers of Darkness. ",7651,7783
94,"""I that speak to you am he,"" went on the white-haired stranger. ",7783,7847
95,"""And I have permitted thee thus to have thy desire and follow me hither in order that I may try of what stuff thou art made. ",7847,7972
96,Before thee lies a Horn and a Sword. ,7972,8009
97,"He that will sound the one, or draw the other, shall, if his courage fail not, be King over the whole of Britain. ",8009,8123
98,"I, Thomas the Rhymer, have spoken it. ",8123,8161
99,"As thou knowest, my tongue cannot lie. ",8161,8200
100,"But list ye, the outcome of it all depends on thy bravery. ",8200,8259
101,"It will be a light task, or a heavy, according as thou layest hand on Sword or Horn first."" ",8259,8351
102,Now Dick was more versed in giving blows than in making music. ,8351,8414
103,"His first impulse was to seize the Sword, then, come what might, he had something in his hand to defend himself with. ",8414,8532
104,"But just as he was about to lift it the thought struck him that, if the place were full of spirits, as he felt sure that it must be, this action of him might be taken to mean defiance. ",8532,8717
105,This might cause them to band themselves together against him. ,8717,8780
106,"So, changing his mind, he picked up the Horn with a trembling hand. ",8780,8848
107,"He blew a blast upon it, which, however, was so weak and feeble that it could scarce be heard at the other end of the hall. ",8848,8972
108,The result that followed was enough to appal the stoutest heart. ,8972,9037
109,Thunder rolled in crashing peals through the immense hall. ,9037,9096
110,The charmed Knights and their horses woke in an instant from their enchanted sleep. ,9096,9180
111,"The Knights sprang to their feet and seized their swords, brandishing them round their heads. ",9180,9274
112,"Their great black chargers stamped, and snorted, and ground their bits, as if eager to escape from their stalls. ",9274,9387
113,"And where a moment before all had been stillness and silence, there was now a scene of wild din and excitement. ",9387,9499
114,Now was the time for Canonbie Dick to play the man. ,9499,9551
115,If he had done so all the rest of his life might have been different. ,9551,9621
116,"But his courage failed him, and he lost his chance. ",9621,9673
117,"Terrified at seeing so many threatening faces turned towards him, he dropped the Horn. ",9673,9760
118,"He made one weak, undecided effort to pick up the Sword. ",9760,9817
119,"But, ere he could do so, a mysterious voice sounded from somewhere in the hall. ",9817,9897
120,"These were the words that it uttered: ""Woe to the coward, that ever he was born, Who did not draw the Sword before he blew the Horn."" ",9897,10031
121,"And, before Dick knew what he was about, a perfect whirlwind of cold, raw air tore through the cavern, carrying the luckless horse-dealer along with it. ",10031,10184
122,"Hurrying him along the narrow passage through which he had entered, dashed him down outside on a bank of loose stones and shale. ",10184,10313
123,He fell right to the bottom. ,10313,10342
124,"He was found, with little life left in him, next morning, by some shepherds, He had just strength enough left to whisper the story of his weird and fearful adventure.",10342,10509
