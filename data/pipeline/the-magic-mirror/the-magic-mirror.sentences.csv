0,"A long, long while ago, before ever the White Men were seen in Senna, there lived a man called Gopani-Kufa. ",0,108
1,"One day, as he was out hunting, he came upon a strange sight. ",108,170
2,An enormous python had caught an antelope and coiled itself around it. ,170,241
3,"The antelope, striking out in despair with its horns, had pinned the python's neck to a tree. ",241,335
4,So deeply had its horns sunk in the soft wood that neither creature could get away. ,335,419
5,'Help!' ,419,427
6,"cried the antelope, 'for I was doing no harm, yet I have been caught. ",427,497
7,"I would have been eaten, had I not defended myself.' ",497,550
8,"'Help me,' said the python, 'for I am Insato, King of all the Reptiles, and will reward you well!' ",550,649
9,"Gopani-Kufa considered for a moment, then stabbing the antelope with his assegai, he set the python free. ",649,755
10,"'I thank you,' said the python. ",755,787
11,"'Come back here with the new moon, when I shall have eaten the antelope, and I will reward you as I promised.' ",787,898
12,"'Yes,' said the dying antelope, 'he will reward you, and lo! ",898,959
13,your reward shall be your own undoing!' ,959,999
14,"Gopani-Kufa went back to his kraal, and with the new moon he returned again to the spot where he had saved the python. ",999,1118
15,"Insato was lying upon the ground, still sleepy from the effects of his huge meal, and when he saw the man he thanked him again, and said: 'Come with me now to Pita, which is my own country, and I will give you what you will of all my possessions.' ",1118,1366
16,"Gopani-Kufa at first was afraid, thinking of what the antelope had said, but finally he consented and followed Insato into the forest. ",1366,1501
17,"For several days they travelled, and at last they came to a hole leading deep into the earth. ",1501,1595
18,"It was not very wide, but large enough to admit a man. ",1595,1650
19,"'Hold on to my tail,' said Insato, 'and I will go down first, drawing you after me.' ",1650,1735
20,"The man did so, and Insato entered. ",1735,1771
21,"Down, down, down they went for days, all the while getting deeper and deeper into the earth, until at last the darkness ended and they dropped into a beautiful country. ",1771,1940
22,"Around them grew short green grass, on which browsed herds of cattle and sheep and goats. ",1940,2030
23,"In the distance Gopani-Kufa saw a great collection of houses all square, built of stone and very tall, and their roofs were shining with gold and burnished iron. ",2030,2192
24,"Gopani-Kufa turned to Insato, but found, in the place of the python, a man, strong and handsome, with the great snake's skin wrapped round him for covering; ",2192,2349
25, and on his arms and neck were rings of pure gold. ,2348,2399
26,The man smiled. ,2399,2415
27,"'I am Insato,' said he, 'but in my own country I take man's shape--even as you see me--for this is Pita, the land over which I am king.' ",2415,2552
28,He then took Gopani-Kufa by the hand and led him towards the town. ,2552,2619
29,On the way they passed rivers in which men and women were bathing and fishing and boating; ,2619,2710
30," and farther on they came to gardens covered with heavy crops of rice and maize, and many other grains which Gopani-Kufa did not even know the name of. ",2709,2861
31,"And as they passed, the people who were singing at their work in the fields, abandoned their labours and saluted Insato with delight, bringing also palm wine and green cocoanuts for refreshment, as to one returned from a long journey. ",2861,3096
32,'These are my children!' ,3096,3121
33,"said Insato, waving his hand towards the people. ",3121,3170
34,"Gopani-Kufa was much astonished at all that he saw, but he said nothing. ",3170,3243
35,Presently they came to the town; ,3243,3276
36," everything here, too, was beautiful, and everything that a man might desire he could obtain. ",3275,3369
37,Even the grains of dust in the streets were of gold and silver. ,3369,3433
38,"Insato conducted Gopani-Kufa to the palace, and showing him his rooms, and the maidens who would wait upon him, told him that they would have a great feast that night, and on the morrow he might name his choice of the riches of Pita and it should be given him. ",3433,3694
39,Then he was away. ,3694,3712
40,Now Gopani-Kufa had a wasp called Zengi-mizi. ,3712,3758
41,"Zengi-mizi was not an ordinary wasp, for the spirit of the father of Gopani-Kufa had entered it, so that it was exceedingly wise. ",3758,3888
42,"In times of doubt Gopani-Kufa always consulted the wasp as to what had better be done, so on this occasion he took it out of the little rush basket in which he carried it, saying: 'Zengi-mizi, what gift shall I ask of Insato to-morrow when he would know the reward he shall bestow on me for saving his life?' ",3888,4197
43,"'Biz-z-z,' hummed Zengi-mizi, 'ask him for Sipao the Mirror.' ",4197,4259
44,And it flew back into its basket. ,4259,4293
45,Gopani-Kufa was astonished at this answer; ,4293,4336
46," but knowing that the words of Zengi-mizi were true words, he determined to make the request. ",4335,4429
47,"So that night they feasted, and on the morrow Insato came to Gopani-Kufa and, giving him greeting joyfully, he said: 'Now, O my friend, name your choice amongst my possessions and you shall have it!' ",4429,4629
48,'O king!' ,4629,4639
49,"answered Gopani-Kufa, 'out of all your possessions I will have the Mirror, Sipao.' ",4639,4722
50,The king started. ,4722,4740
51,"'O friend, Gopani-Kufa,' he said, 'ask anything but that! ",4740,4798
52,I did not think that you would request that which is most precious to me.' ,4798,4873
53,"'Let me think over it again then, O king,' said Gopani-Kufa, 'and to-morrow I will let you know if I change my mind.' ",4873,4991
54,"But the king was still much troubled, fearing the loss of Sipao, for the mirror had magic powers, so that he who owned it had but to ask and his wish would be fulfilled; ",4991,5161
55, to it Insato owed all that he possessed. ,5160,5202
56,"As soon as the king left him, Gopani-Kufa again took Zengi-mizi, out of his basket. ",5202,5286
57,"'Zengi-mizi,' he said, 'the king seems loth to grant my request for the Mirror--is there not some other thing of equal value for which I might ask?' ",5286,5435
58,"And the wasp answered: 'There is nothing in the world, O Gopani-Kufa, which is of such value as this Mirror, for it is a Wishing Mirror, and accomplishes the desires of him who owns it. ",5435,5621
59,"If the king hesitates, go to him the next day, and the day after, and in the end he will bestow the Mirror upon you, for you saved his life.' ",5621,5763
60,And it was even so. ,5763,5783
61,"For three days Gopani- Kufa returned the same answer to the king, and, at last, with tears in his eyes, Insato gave him the Mirror, which was of polished iron, saying: 'Take Sipao, then, O Gopani- Kufa, and may thy wishes come true. ",5783,6016
62,Go back now to thine own country; ,6016,6050
63, Sipao will show you the way.' ,6049,6080
64,"Gopani-Kufa was greatly rejoiced, and, taking farewell of the king, said to the Mirror: 'Sipao, Sipao, I wish to be back upon the Earth again!' ",6080,6224
65,Instantly he found himself standing upon the upper earth; ,6224,6282
66," but, not knowing the spot, he said again to the Mirror: 'Sipao, Sipao, I want the path to my own kraal!' ",6281,6387
67,And behold! ,6387,6399
68,right before him lay the path! ,6399,6430
69,"When he arrived home he found his wife and daughter mourning for him, for they thought that he had been eaten by lions; ",6430,6550
70," but he comforted them, saying that while following a wounded antelope he had missed his way and had wandered for a long time before he had found the path again. ",6549,6711
71,"That night he asked Zengi-mizi, in whom sat the spirit of his father, what he had better ask Sipao for next? ",6711,6820
72,"'Biz-z-z,' said the wasp, 'would you not like to be as great a chief as Insato?' ",6820,6901
73,"And Gopani-Kufa smiled, and took the Mirror and said to it: 'Sipao, Sipao, I want a town as great as that of Insato, the King of Pita; ",6901,7036
74, and I wish to be chief over it!' ,7035,7069
75,"Then all along the banks of the Zambesi river, which flowed near by, sprang up streets of stone buildings, and their roofs shone with gold and burnished iron like those in Pita; ",7069,7247
76," and in the streets men and women were walking, and young boys were driving out the sheep and cattle to pasture; ",7246,7359
77, and from the river came shouts and laughter from the young men and maidens who had launched their canoes and were fishing. ,7358,7482
78,And when the people of the new town beheld Gopani-Kufa they rejoiced greatly and hailed him as chief. ,7482,7584
79,"Gopani-Kufa was now as powerful as Insato the King of the Reptiles had been, and he and his family moved into the palace that stood high above the other buildings right in the middle of the town. ",7584,7780
80,"His wife was too astonished at all these wonders to ask any questions, but his daughter Shasasa kept begging him to tell her how he had suddenly become so great; ",7780,7942
81," so at last he revealed the whole secret, and even entrusted Sipao the Mirror to her care, saying: 'It will be safer with you, my daughter, for you dwell apart; ",7941,8102
82," whereas men come to consult me on affairs of state, and the Mirror might be stolen.' ",8101,8187
83,"Then Shasasa took the Magic Mirror and hid it beneath her pillow, and after that for many years Gopani-Kufa ruled his people both well and wisely, so that all men loved him, and never once did he need to ask Sipao to grant him a wish. ",8187,8422
84,"Now it happened that, after many years, when the hair of Gopani-Kufa was turning grey with age, there came white men to that country. ",8422,8556
85,"Up the Zambesi they came, and they fought long and fiercely with Gopani-Kufa; ",8556,8634
86," but, because of the power of the Magic Mirror, he beat them, and they fled to the sea-coast. ",8633,8727
87,"Chief among them was one Rei, a man of much cunning, who sought to discover whence sprang Gopani-Kufa's power. ",8727,8838
88,"So one day he called to him a trusty servant named Butou, and said: 'Go you to the town and find out for me what is the secret of its greatness.' ",8838,8984
89,"And Butou, dressing himself in rags, set out, and when he came to Gopani-Kufa's town he asked for the chief; ",8984,9093
90, and the people took him into the presence of Gopani-Kufa. ,9092,9151
91,"When the white man saw him he humbled himself, and said: 'O Chief! ",9151,9218
92,"take pity on me, for I have no home! ",9218,9255
93,"When Rei marched against you I alone stood apart, for I knew that all the strength of the Zambesi lay in your hands, and because I would not fight against you he turned me forth into the forest to starve!' ",9255,9461
94,"And Gopani-Kufa believed the white man's story, and he took him in and feasted him, and gave him a house. ",9461,9567
95,In this way the end came. ,9567,9593
96,"For the heart of Shasasa, the daughter of Gopani-Kufa, went forth to Butou the traitor, and from her he learnt the secret of the Magic Mirror. ",9593,9736
97,"One night, when all the town slept, he felt beneath her pillow and, finding the Mirror, he stole it and fled back with it to Rei, the chief of the white men. ",9736,9894
98,"So it befell that, one day, as Gopani-Kufa was gazing up at the river from a window of the palace he again saw the war-canoes of the white men; ",9894,10038
99, and at the sight his spirit misgave him. ,10037,10079
100,'Shasasa! ,10079,10089
101,my daughter!' ,10089,10103
102,"he cried wildly, 'go fetch me the mirror, for the white men are at hand.' ",10103,10177
103,"'Woe is me, my father!' ",10177,10201
104,she sobbed. ,10201,10213
105,'The Mirror is gone! ,10213,10234
106,"For I loved Butou the traitor, and he has stolen Sipao from me!' ",10234,10299
107,"Then Gopani-Kufa calmed himself, and drew out Zengi-mizi from its rush basket. ",10299,10378
108,'O spirit of my father!' ,10378,10403
109,"he said, 'what now shall I do?' ",10403,10435
110,'O Gopani-Kufa!' ,10435,10452
111,"hummed the wasp, 'there is nothing now that can be done, for the words of the antelope which you slew are being fulfilled.' ",10452,10576
112,'Alas! ,10576,10583
113,I am an old man--I had forgotten!' ,10583,10618
114,cried the chief. ,10618,10635
115,'The words of the antelope were true words--my reward shall be my undoing--they are being fulfilled!' ,10635,10737
116,Then the white men fell upon the people of Gopani-Kufa and slew them together with the chief and his daughter Shasasa; ,10737,10856
117," and since then all the power of the Earth has rested in the hands of the white men, for they have in their possession Sipao, the Magic Mirror.",10855,10999
