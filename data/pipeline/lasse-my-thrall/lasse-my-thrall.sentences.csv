0,"Once upon a time there was a prince or a duke or whatever you choose to call him, but at any rate a noble tremendously high-born, who did not want to stay at home. ",0,164
1,"And so he traveled about the world, and wherever he went he was well received, and hobnobbed with the very finest people; ",164,286
2, for he had an unheard of amount of money. ,285,328
3,"He at once found friends and acquaintances, no matter where he came; ",328,397
4, for whoever has a full trough can always find pigs to thrust their snouts into it. ,396,480
5,"But since he handled his money as he did, it grew less and less, and at last he was left high and dry, without a red cent. ",480,603
6,And there was an end to all his many friends; ,603,649
7, for they did just as the pigs do. ,648,683
8,"When he had been well fleeced, they began to snivel and grunt, and soon scattered, each about his own business. ",683,795
9,"And there he stood, after having been led about by the nose, abandoned by all. ",795,874
10,All had been glad to help him get rid of his money; ,874,926
11," but none were willing to help him regain it, so there was nothing left for him to do but to wander back home again like a journeyman apprentice, and beg his way as he went. ",925,1099
12,"Late one evening he found himself in a big forest, without any idea as to where he might spend the night. ",1099,1205
13,"And as he was looking around, his glance happened to fall on an old hut, peeping out from among the bushes. ",1205,1313
14,Of course an old hut was no lodging for such a fine gentleman; ,1313,1376
15," but when we cannot have what we want, we must take what we can get, and since there was no help for it, he went into the hut. ",1375,1502
16,"There was not even a cat in it, not even a stool to sit on. ",1502,1562
17,But against one wall there was a great chest. ,1562,1608
18,What might there be in the chest? ,1608,1642
19,Suppose there were a few moldy crusts of bread in it? ,1642,1696
20,"They would taste good to him, for he had not been given a single thing all day long, and he was so hungry that his inwards stuck to his ribs. ",1696,1838
21,He opened the chest. ,1838,1859
22,"But within the chest was another chest, and in that chest still another chest, and so it went, one always smaller than the other, until they were nothing but little boxes. ",1859,2031
23,And the more there were of them the more trouble he took to open them; ,2031,2102
24," for whatever was hidden away so carefully must be something exceptionally beautiful, thought he. ",2101,2199
25,"At last he came to a tiny box, and in the tiny box was a slip of paper--and that was all he had for his pains! ",2199,2310
26,At first he was much depressed. ,2310,2342
27,"But all at once, he saw that something was written on the piece of paper, and on closer examination he was even able to spell out the words, though they had a strange appearance. ",2342,2521
28,"And he read: ""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",2521,2554
29,"No sooner had he spoken these words than something answered, close to his ear: ""What does my master command?"" ",2554,2664
30,"He looked around, but saw no one. ",2664,2698
31,"That's strange, thought he, and once more read aloud: ""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",2698,2772
32,"And just as before came the answer: ""What does my master command?"" ",2772,2839
33,"""If there be some one about who hears what I say, he might be kind enough to get me a little something to eat,"" said he; ",2839,2960
34," and at that very moment a table, covered with all the good things to eat that one could imagine, was standing in the hut. ",2959,3082
35,He at once began to eat and drink and did well by himself. ,3082,3141
36,"I have never had a better meal in my life, thought he. ",3141,3196
37,"And when his hunger was completely satisfied, he grew sleepy and took up his scrap of paper again. ",3196,3295
38,"""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",2534,2554
39,"""What does my master command?"" ",2633,2664
40,"""Now that you have brought me food and drink, you must also bring me a bed in which to sleep. ",3346,3440
41,"But it must be a very fine bed,"" said he; ",3440,3482
42," for as you may well imagine, his ideas were more top-lofty now that he had eaten well. ",3481,3569
43,His command was at once obeyed; ,3569,3601
44," and a bed so fine and handsome stood in the hut, that a king might have been glad to have found such sleeping accommodations. ",3600,3727
45,Now this was all very well and good; ,3727,3764
46," but the good can always be bettered, and when he had lain down, he decided that, after all, the hut was far too wretched for such a fine bed. ",3763,3906
47,"He took up the scrap of paper: ""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",3906,3957
48,"""What does my master command?"" ",2633,2664
49,"""If you can produce such a meal, and such a bed here in the wild wood, you must surely be able to give me a better room; ",3988,4109
50," for you know I am one of those who are used to sleeping in a castle, with golden mirrors and rugs of gold brocade and luxuries and conveniences of every kind,"" said he. ",4108,4278
51,"And no sooner had he spoken the words, than he was lying in the most magnificent room he had ever seen. ",4278,4382
52,"Now matters were arranged to suit him, and he was quite content as he turned his face to the wall and closed his eyes. ",4382,4501
53,But the room he had slept in was not the end of his magnificence. ,4501,4567
54,"When he woke the following morning and looked around, he saw that he had been sleeping in a great castle. ",4567,4673
55,"There was one room after another, and wherever he went walls and ceilings were covered with ornaments and decorations of every kind, all glittering so splendidly when the rays of the sun fell on them that he had to put his hand to his eyes; ",4673,4914
56, for wherever he looked everything sparkled with gold and silver. ,4913,4979
57,Then he glanced out of the window and first began to realize how really beautiful everything was. ,4979,5077
58,"Gone were the fir-trees and juniper bushes, and in their place showed the loveliest garden one might wish to see, filled with beautiful trees and roses of every variety, in bush and tree form. ",5077,5270
59,"But there was not a human being in sight, not even a cat. ",5270,5328
60,"Yet he found it quite natural that everything should be so fine, and that he should once more have become a great lord. ",5328,5448
61,"He took up the scrap of paper: ""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",3906,3957
62,"""What does my master command?"" ",2633,2664
63,"""Now that you have provided me with food and a castle in which to dwell, I am going to stay here, because it suits me,"" said he, ""but I cannot live here all alone in this fashion. ",5530,5710
64,"I must have serving-men and serving-maids, at my command."" ",5710,5769
65,And so it was. ,5769,5784
66,"Servants and lackeys and maids and serving-women of every description arrived, and some of them bowed and others courtseyed, and now the duke really began to feel content. ",5784,5956
67,"Now it happened that another great castle lay on the opposite side of the forest, in which dwelt a king who owned the forest, and many broad acres of field and meadow round about. ",5956,6136
68,"And when the king came and happened to look out of his window, he saw the new castle, on whose roof the golden weathercocks were swinging to and fro, from time to time, shining in his eyes. ",6136,6326
69,"""This is very strange,"" thought he, and sent for his courtiers. ",6326,6390
70,"They came without delay, bowing and scraping. ",6390,6436
71,"""Do you see the castle yonder?"" ",6436,6468
72,said the king. ,6468,6483
73,Their eyes grew as large as saucers and they looked. ,6483,6536
74,"Yes, indeed, they saw the castle. ",6536,6570
75,"""Who has dared to build such a castle on my ground?"" ",6570,6623
76,"The courtiers bowed and scraped, but did not know. ",6623,6674
77,So the king sent for his soldiers. ,6674,6709
78,They came tramping in and presented arms. ,6709,6751
79,"""Send out all my soldiers and horsemen,"" said the king, ""tear down the castle instantly, hang whoever built it, and see to this at once."" ",6751,6889
80,The soldiers assembled in the greatest haste and set forth. ,6889,6949
81,"The drummers beat their drums and the trumpeters blew their trumpets, and the other musicians practiced their art, each in his own way; ",6949,7085
82, so that the duke heard them long before they came in sight. ,7084,7145
83,"But this was not the first time he had heard music of this sort, and he knew what it meant, so once more he took up the scrap of paper: ""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",7145,7301
84,"""What does my master command?"" ",2633,2664
85,"""There are soldiers coming,"" said he, ""and now you must provide me with soldiers and horsemen until I have twice as many as the folk on the other side of the forest. ",7332,7498
86,"And sabers and pistols and muskets and cannon, and all that goes with them--but you must be quick about it!"" ",7498,7607
87,"Quick it was, and when the duke looked out there was a countless host of soldiers drawn up around the castle. ",7607,7717
88,"When the king's people arrived, they stopped and did not dare advance. ",7717,7788
89,But the duke was by no means shy. ,7788,7822
90,He went at once to the king's captain and asked him what he wanted. ,7822,7890
91,The captain repeated his instructions. ,7890,7929
92,"""They will not gain you anything,"" said the duke. ",7929,7979
93,"""You can see how many soldiers I have, and if the king chooses to listen to me, we can agree to become friends, I will aid him against all his enemies, and what we undertake will succeed."" ",7979,8168
94,"The captain was pleased with this proposal, so the duke invited him to the castle, together with all his officers, and his soldiers were given a swallow or two of something wet and plenty to eat along with it. ",8168,8378
95,"But while the duke and the officers were eating and drinking, there was more or less talk, and the duke learned that the king had a daughter, as yet unmarried and so lovely that her like had never been seen. ",8378,8586
96,"And the more they brought the king's officers to eat, the stronger they inclined to the opinion that the king's daughter would make a good wife for the duke. ",8586,8744
97,"And as they talked about it, the duke himself began to think it over. ",8744,8814
98,"The worst of it was, said the officers, that she was very haughty, and never even deigned to look at a man. ",8814,8922
99,But the duke only laughed. ,8922,8949
100,"""If it be no worse than that,"" he said, ""it is a trouble that may be cured."" ",8949,9026
101,"When at last the soldiers had stowed away as much as they could hold, they shouted hurrah until they woke the echoes in the hills, and marched away. ",9026,9175
102,"One may imagine what a fine parade march it was, for some of them had grown a little loose-jointed in the knees. ",9175,9288
103,"The duke charged them to carry his greetings to the king, and say that he would soon pay him a visit. ",9288,9390
104,"When the duke was alone once more, he began to think of the princess again, and whether she were really as beautiful as the soldiers had said. ",9390,9533
105,He decided he would like to find out for himself. ,9533,9583
106,"Since so many strange things had happened that day, it was quite possible, thought he. ",9583,9670
107,"""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",2534,2554
108,"""What does my master command?"" ",2633,2664
109,"""Only that you bring the king's daughter here, as soon as she has fallen asleep,"" said he. ",9721,9812
110,"""But mind that she does not wake up, either on her way here, or on her way back."" ",9812,9894
111,And before long there lay the princess on the bed. ,9894,9945
112,"She was sleeping soundly, and looked charming as she lay there asleep. ",9945,10016
113,One had to admit that she was as sweet as sugar. ,10016,10065
114,The duke walked all around her; ,10065,10097
115," but she appeared just as beautiful from one side as from the other, and the more the duke looked at her, the better she pleased him. ",10096,10230
116,"""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",2534,2554
117,"""What does my master command?"" ",2633,2664
118,"""Now you must take the princess home again,"" said he, ""because now I know what she looks like and to-morrow I shall sue for her hand."" ",10281,10416
119,The following morning the king stepped to the window. ,10416,10470
120,"""Now I shall not have to see that castle across the way,"" he thought to himself. ",10470,10551
121,"But the evil one must have had a hand in the matter--there stood the castle just as before, and the sun was shining brightly on its roof, and the weather-vanes were sending beams into his eyes. ",10551,10745
122,"The king once more fell into a rage, and shouted for all his people, who hurried to him with more than usual rapidity. ",10745,10864
123,The courtiers bowed and scraped and the soldiers marched in parade step and presented arms. ,10864,10956
124,"""Do you see that castle there?"" ",10956,10988
125,roared the king. ,10988,11005
126,"They stretched their necks, their eyes grew large as saucers and they looked. ",11005,11083
127,"Yes, indeed, they saw it. ",11083,11109
128,"""Did I not order you to tear down that castle and hang its builder?"" ",11109,11178
129,he said. ,11178,11187
130,This they could not deny; ,11187,11213
131," but now the captain himself stepped forward and told what had occurred, and what an alarming number of soldiers the duke had, and how magnificent his castle was. ",11212,11375
132,"Then he also repeated what the duke had said, and that he had sent his greetings to the king. ",11375,11469
133,"All this made the king somewhat dizzy, and he had to set his crown on the table and scratch his head. ",11469,11571
134,It was beyond his comprehension--for all that he was a king; ,11571,11632
135," since he could have sworn that it had all come to pass in the course of a single night, and if the duke were not the devil himself, he was at least a magician. ",11631,11792
136,"And as he sat there and thought, the princess came in. ",11792,11847
137,"""God greet you, father,"" she said, ""I had a most strange and lovely dream last night."" ",11847,11934
138,"""And what did you dream, my girl?"" ",11934,11969
139,said the king. ,6468,6483
140,"""O, I dreamt that I was in the new castle over yonder, and there was a duke, handsome and so splendid beyond anything I could have imagined, and now I want a husband."" ",11984,12152
141,"""What, you want a husband, and you have never even deigned to look at a man; ",12152,12229
142," that is very strange!"" ",12228,12252
143,said the king. ,6468,6483
144,"""Be that as it may,"" said the princess, ""but that is how I feel now; ",12267,12336
145," and I want a husband, and the duke is the husband I want,"" she concluded. ",12335,12410
146,The king simply could not get over the astonishment the duke had caused him. ,12410,12487
147,"Suddenly he heard an extraordinary beating of drums, and sounding of trumpets and other instruments of every kind. ",12487,12602
148,"And a message came that the duke had arrived with a great retinue, all so magnificently attired that every seam of their dresses was sparkling with gold and silver. ",12602,12767
149,"The king, in his crown and finest robe of state, stood looking down the stairway, and the princess was all the more in favor of carrying out her idea as quickly as possible. ",12767,12941
150,"The duke greeted the king pleasantly, and the king returned his greeting in the same way, and discussing their affairs together they became good friends. ",12941,13095
151,"There was a great banquet, and the duke sat beside the princess at the table. ",13095,13173
152,"What they said to each other I do not know, but the duke knew so well how to talk that, no matter what he said, the princess could not say no, and so he went to the king and begged for her hand. ",13173,13368
153,"The king could not exactly refuse it, for the duke was the kind of a man whom it was better to have for a friend than for an enemy; ",13368,13500
154," but he could not give his answer out of hand, either. ",13499,13554
155,"First he wished to see the duke's castle, and know how matters stood with regard to this, that and the other--which was natural. ",13554,13683
156,"So it was agreed that they should pay the duke a visit and bring the princess with them, in order that she might examine his possessions, and with that they parted. ",13683,13848
157,"When the duke reached home, Lasse had a lively time of it, for he was given any number of commissions. ",13848,13951
158,"But he rushed about, carrying them out, and everything was arranged so satisfactorily that when the king arrived with his daughter, a thousand pens could not have described it. ",13951,14128
159,"They went through all the rooms and looked around, and everything was as it should be, and even better thought the king, who was very happy. ",14128,14269
160,"Then the wedding was celebrated and when it was over, and the duke returned home with his young wife, he, too, gave a splendid banquet, and that is how it went. ",14269,14430
161,"After some time had passed, the duke one evening heard the words: ""Is my master content now?"" ",14430,14524
162,"It was Lasse, though the duke could not see him. ",14524,14573
163,"""I am well content,"" answered the duke, ""for you have brought me all that I have."" ",14573,14656
164,"""But what did I get for it?"" ",14656,14685
165,said Lasse. ,14685,14697
166,"""Nothing,"" replied the duke, ""but, heaven above, what was I to give you, who are not flesh and blood, and whom I cannot even see,"" said he. ",14697,14837
167,"""Yet if there be anything I can do for you, why let me know what it is, and I will do it."" ",14837,14928
168,"""I would very much like to have the little scrap of paper that you keep in the box,"" said Lasse. ",14928,15025
169,"""If that is all you want, and if such a trifle is of any service to you, your wish shall be granted, for I believe I know the words by heart now,"" said the duke. ",15025,15187
170,"Lasse thanked him, and said all the duke need do, would be to lay the paper on the chair beside his bed, when he went to sleep, and that he would fetch it during the night. ",15187,15360
171,"This the duke did, and then he went to bed and fell asleep. ",15360,15420
172,"But toward morning the duke woke up, freezing so that his teeth chattered, and when he had fully opened his eyes, he saw that he had been stripped of everything, and had scarcely a shirt to his name. ",15420,15620
173,"And instead of lying in the handsome bed in the handsome bed-room in the magnificent castle, he lay on the big chest in the old hut. ",15620,15753
174,"He at once called out: ""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",15753,15796
175,But there was no answer. ,15796,15821
176,"Then he cried again: ""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",15821,15862
177,Again there was no answer. ,15862,15889
178,"So he called out as loudly as he could: ""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",15889,15949
179,But this third call was also in vain. ,15949,15987
180,"Now he began to realize what had happened, and that Lasse, when he obtained the scrap of paper, no longer had to serve him, and that he himself had made this possible. ",15987,16155
181,"But now things were as they were, and there stood the duke in the old hut, with scarcely a shirt to his name. ",16155,16265
182,"The princess herself was not much better off, though she had kept her clothes; ",16265,16344
183," for they had been given her by her father, and Lasse had no power over them. ",16343,16421
184,"Now the duke had to explain everything to the princess, and beg her to leave him, since it would be best if he tried to get along as well as he could himself, said he. ",16421,16589
185,But this the princess would not do. ,16589,16625
186,"She had a better memory for what the pastor had said when he married them, she told him, and that she was never, never to leave him. ",16625,16758
187,"At length the king awoke in his castle, and when he looked out of the window, he saw not a single stone of the other castle in which his son-in-law and his daughter lived. ",16758,16930
188,He grew uneasy and sent for his courtiers. ,16930,16973
189,"They came in, bowing and scraping. ",16973,17008
190,"""Do you see the castle there, on the other side of the forest?"" ",17008,17072
191,he asked. ,17072,17082
192,They stretched their necks and opened their eyes. ,17082,17132
193,But they could see nothing. ,17132,17160
194,"""What has become of it?"" ",17160,17185
195,said the king. ,6468,6483
196,But this question they were unable to answer. ,17200,17246
197,"In a short time the king and his entire court set out, passed through the forest, and when they came to the place where the castle, with its great gardens, should have been standing, they saw nothing but juniper-bushes and scrub-pines. ",17246,17482
198,And then they happened to see the little hut amid the brush. ,17482,17543
199,He went in and--O the poor king!--what did he see? ,17543,17594
200,"There stood his son-in-law, with scarcely a shirt to his name, and his daughter, and she had none too much to wear, and was crying and sniveling at a fearful rate. ",17594,17758
201,"""For heaven's sake, what is the trouble here?"" ",17758,17805
202,said the king. ,6468,6483
203,But he received no answer; ,17820,17847
204, for the duke would rather have died than have told him the whole story. ,17846,17919
205,"The king urged and pressed him, first amiably, then in anger; ",17919,17981
206, but the duke remained obstinate and would have nothing to say. ,17980,18044
207,"Then the king fell into a rage, which is not very surprising, for now he realized that this fine duke was not what he purported to be, and he therefore ordered him to be hung, and hung on the spot. ",18044,18242
208,"It is true that the princess pleaded earnestly for him, but tears and prayers were useless now, for he was a rascal and should die a rascal's death--thus spake the king. ",18242,18412
209,And so it was. ,5769,5784
210,The king's people set up a gallows and put a rope around the duke's neck. ,18427,18501
211,"But as they were leading him to the gallows, the princess got hold of the hangman and gave him a gratuity, for which they were to arrange matters in such wise that the duke need not die. ",18501,18688
212,"And toward evening they were to cut him down, and he and the princess would disappear. ",18688,18775
213,So the bargain was made. ,18775,18800
214,"In the meantime they strung him up and then the king, together with his court and all the people, went away. ",18800,18909
215,Now the duke was at the end of his rope. ,18909,18950
216,Yet he had time enough to reflect about his mistake in not contenting himself with an inch instead of reaching out at once for an ell; ,18950,19085
217, and that he had so foolishly given back the scrap of paper to Lasse annoyed him most of all. ,19084,19178
218,"If I only had it again, I would show every one that adversity has made me wise, he thought to himself. ",19178,19281
219,But when the horse is stolen we close the stable door. ,19281,19336
220,And that is the way of the world. ,19336,19370
221,"And then he dangled his legs, since for the time being there was nothing else for him to do. ",19370,19463
222,"It had been a long, hard day for him, and he was not sorry when he saw the sun sinking behind the forest. ",19463,19569
223,But just as the sun was setting he suddenly heard a most tremendous Yo ho! ,19569,19644
224,"and when he looked down there were seven carts of worn-out shoes coming along the road, and a-top the last cart was a little old man in gray, with a night-cap on his head. ",19644,19816
225,"He had the face of some horrible specter, and was not much better to look at in other respects. ",19816,19912
226,"He drove straight up to the gallows, and stopped when he was directly beneath them, looked up at the duke and laughed--the horrible old creature! ",19912,20058
227,"""And is this the measure of your stupidity?"" ",20058,20103
228,"he said, ""but then what is a fellow of your sort to do with his stupidity, if he does not put it to some use?""-",20103,20214
229,--and then he laughed again. ,20213,20242
230,"""Yes, there you hang, and here I am carting off all the shoes I wore out going about on your silly errands. ",20242,20350
231,"I wonder, sometimes, whether you can actually read what is written on that scrap of paper, and whether you recognize it,"" said he, laughing again, indulging in all sorts of horse-play, and waving the scrap of paper under the duke's nose. ",20350,20588
232,"But all who are hanging on the gallows are not dead, and this time Lasse was the greater fool of the two. ",20588,20694
233,The duke snatched--and tore the scrap of paper from his hand! ,20694,20756
234,"""Lasse, my thrall!"" ",2534,2554
235,"""What does my master command?"" ",2633,2664
236,"""Cut me down from the gallows at once, and restore the castle and everything else just as it was before, then when it is dark, bring the princess back to it."" ",20807,20966
237,"Everything was attended to with alarming rapidity, and soon all was exactly as it had been before Lasse had decamped. ",20966,21084
238,"When the king awoke the following morning, he looked out of the window as usual, and there the castle was standing as before, with its weathercocks gleaming handsomely in the sunlight. ",21084,21269
239,"He sent for his courtiers, and they came in bowing and scraping. ",21269,21334
240,"""Do you see the castle over yonder?"" ",21334,21371
241,asked the king. ,21371,21387
242,"They stretched their necks, and gazed and stared. ",21387,21437
243,"Yes, indeed, they could see the castle. ",21437,21477
244,Then the king sent for the princess; ,21477,21514
245, but she was not there. ,21513,21537
246,Thereupon the king set off to see whether his son-in-law was hanging in the appointed spot; ,21537,21629
247," but no, there was not a sign of either son-in-law or gallows. ",21628,21691
248,Then he had to take off his crown and scratch his head. ,21691,21747
249,"Yet that did not change matters, and he could not for the life of him understand why things should be as they were. ",21747,21863
250,"Finally he set out with his entire court, and when they reached the spot where the castle should have been standing, there it stood. ",21863,21996
251,"The gardens and the roses were just as they had been, and the duke's servitors were to be seen in swarms beneath the trees. ",21996,22120
252,"His son-in-law in person, together with his daughter, dressed in the finest clothes, came down the stairs to meet him. ",22120,22239
253,"The devil has a hand in it, thought the king; ",22239,22285
254, and so strange did all seem to him that he did not trust the evidence of his own eyes. ,22284,22372
255,"""God greet you and welcome, father!"" ",22372,22409
256,said the duke. ,7964,7979
257,The king could only stare at him. ,22424,22458
258,"""Are you, are you my son-in-law?"" ",22458,22492
259,he asked. ,17072,17082
260,"""Why, of course,"" said the duke, ""who else am I supposed to be?"" ",22502,22567
261,"""Did I not have you strung up yesterday as a thief and a vagabond?"" ",22567,22635
262,inquired the king. ,22635,22654
263,"""I really believe father has gone out of his mind on the way over to us,"" said the duke and laughed. ",22654,22755
264,"""Does father think that I would allow myself to be hanged so easily? ",22755,22824
265,"Or is there any one present who dare suppose such a thing?"" ",22824,22884
266,"he said, and looked them straight in the eye, so that they knew he was looking at them. ",22884,22972
267,They bent their backs and bowed and scraped. ,22972,23017
268,"""And who can imagine any such thing? ",23017,23054
269,How could it be possible? ,23054,23080
270,"Or should there be any one present who dare say that the king wishes me ill, let him speak out,"" said the duke, and gazed at them with even greater keenness than before. ",23080,23250
271,All bent their backs and bowed and scraped. ,23250,23294
272,How should any of them come to any such conclusion? ,23294,23346
273,"No, none of them were foolish to such a degree, they said. ",23346,23405
274,Now the king was really at a loss to know what to think. ,23405,23462
275,"When he looked at the duke he felt sure that he could never have wished to harm him, and yet--he was not quite sure. ",23462,23579
276,"""Was I not here yesterday, and was not the whole castle gone, and had not an old hut taken its place, and did I not enter the hut and see you standing there with scarcely a shirt to your name?"" ",23579,23773
277,he asked. ,17072,17082
278,"""How father talks,"" said the duke. ",23783,23818
279,"""I am afraid, very much afraid, that trolls have blinded you, and led you astray in the forest. ",23818,23914
280,"What do you think?"" ",23914,23934
281,he said and turned to the courtiers. ,23934,23971
282,"They at once bowed and cringed fifty times in succession, and took the duke's side, as stands to reason. ",23971,24076
283,The king rubbed his eyes and looked around. ,24076,24120
284,"""It must be as you say,"" he told the duke, ""and I believe that I have recovered my reason, and have found my eyes again. ",24120,24241
285,"And it would have been a sin and shame had I had you hung,"" said he. ",24241,24310
286,Then he grew joyful and no one gave the matter further thought. ,24310,24374
287,"But adversity teaches one to be wise, so people say, and the duke now began to attend to most things himself, and to see to it that Lasse did not have to wear out so many pairs of shoes. ",24374,24561
288,"The king at once bestowed half the kingdom upon him, which gave him plenty to do, and people said that one would have to look far in order to find a better ruler. ",24561,24724
289,"Then Lasse came to the duke one day, and though he did not look much better than before, he was more civil and did not venture to grin and carry on. ",24724,24873
290,"""You no longer need my help,"" said he, ""for though formerly I used to wear out all my shoes, I now cannot even wear out a single pair, and I almost believe my legs are moss-grown. ",24873,25053
291,"Will you not discharge me?"" ",25053,25081
292,The duke thought he could. ,25081,25108
293,"""I have taken great pains to spare you, and I really believe that I can get along without you,"" he replied. ",25108,25216
294,"""But the castle here and all the other things I could not well dispense with, since I never again could find an architect like yourself, and you may take for granted that I have no wish to ornament the gallows-tree a second time. ",25216,25446
295,"Therefore I will not, of my own free will, give you back the scrap of paper,"" said he. ",25446,25533
296,"""While it is in your possession I have nothing to fear,"" answered Lasse. ",25533,25606
297,"""But should the paper fall into other hands, then I should have to begin to run and work all over again and that, just that, is what I would like to prevent. ",25606,25764
298,"When a fellow has been working a thousand years, as I have, he is bound to grow weary at last."" ",25764,25860
299,"So they came to the conclusion that the duke should put the scrap of paper in its little box and bury it seven ells underground, beneath a stone that had grown there and would remain there as well. ",25860,26058
300,Then they thanked each other for pleasant comradeship and separated. ,26058,26127
301,"The duke did as he had agreed to do, and no one saw him hide the box. ",26127,26197
302,"He lived happily with his princess, and was blessed with sons and daughters. ",26197,26274
303,"When the king died, he inherited the whole kingdom and, as you may imagine, he was none the worse off thereby, and no doubt he is still living and ruling there, unless he has died. ",26274,26455
304,"As to the little box containing the scrap of paper, many are still digging and searching for it.",26455,26552
