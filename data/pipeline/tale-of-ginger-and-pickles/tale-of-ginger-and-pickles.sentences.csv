0,Once upon a time there was a village shop. ,0,43
1,"The name over the window was ""Ginger and Pickles."" ",43,94
2,It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls--Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles. ,94,232
3,The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. ,232,288
4,Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings. ,288,372
5,"They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes. ",372,418
6,"In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, hair-pins and mutton chops. ",418,578
7,Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. ,578,632
8,"Ginger was a yellow tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier. ",632,688
9,The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles. ,688,744
10,The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger. ,744,826
11,"Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water. ",826,915
12,"""I cannot bear,"" said he, ""to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels."" ",915,1008
13,"""I have the same feeling about rats,"" replied Pickles, ""but it would never do to eat our own customers; ",1008,1112
14," they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's."" ",1111,1163
15,"""On the contrary, they would go nowhere,"" replied Ginger gloomily. ",1163,1230
16,(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. ,1230,1289
17,She did not give credit.) ,1289,1315
18,Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit. ,1315,1357
19,"Now the meaning of ""credit"" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it--she says she will pay another time. ",1357,1529
20,"And Pickles makes a low bow and says, ""With pleasure, madam,"" and it is written down in a book. ",1529,1625
21,"The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles. ",1625,1729
22,"But there is no money in what is called the ""till."" ",1729,1781
23,"The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. ",1781,1876
24,But there was always no money; ,1876,1907
25, they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints. ,1906,1967
26,"But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's. ",1967,2038
27,"As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods. ",2038,2124
28,Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock. ,2124,2177
29,They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed. ,2177,2234
30,"When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog licence. ",2234,2330
31,"""It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,"" said Pickles. ",2330,2396
32,"""It is your own fault for being a terrier; ",2396,2439
33," _I_ do not require a licence, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog."" ",2438,2508
34,"""It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. ",2508,2568
35,"I have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;""",2568,2638
36,""" said Pickles. ",2380,2396
37,"""The place is full of policemen. ",2653,2686
38,"I met one as I was coming home."" ",2686,2719
39,"""Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon."" ",2719,2803
40,"""I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,"" replied Ginger. ",2803,2869
41,"""And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--Where are all the cream crackers?"" ",2869,2953
42,"""You have eaten them yourself,"" replied Ginger. ",2953,3001
43,Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour. ,3001,3051
44,They did accounts. ,3051,3070
45,"They added up sums and sums, and sums. ",3070,3109
46,"""Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; ",3109,3165
47," he has had an ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October."" ",3164,3229
48,"""What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?"" ",3229,3315
49,"""Send in all the bills again to everybody 'with comp'ts,'"" replied Ginger. ",3315,3390
50,"After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door. ",3390,3483
51,They came out of the back parlour. ,3483,3518
52,"There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book! ",3518,3602
53,"Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes. ",3602,3676
54,"""Bite him, Pickles! ",3676,3696
55,"bite him!"" ",3696,3707
56,"spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel, ""he's only a German doll!"" ",3707,3775
57,The policeman went on writing in his notebook; ,3775,3822
58," twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle. ",3821,3898
59,Pickles barked till he was hoarse. ,3898,3933
60,But still the policeman took no notice. ,3933,3973
61,"He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches. ",3973,4034
62,At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty. ,4034,4108
63,The policeman had disappeared. ,4108,4139
64,But the envelope remained. ,4139,4166
65,"""Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? ",4166,4229
66,"I am afraid it is a summons,"" said Pickles. ",4229,4273
67,"""No,"" replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, ""it is the rates and taxes, 3 pounds, 19 shillings, 11 pence 3 farthings."" ",4273,4399
68,"""This is the last straw,"" said Pickles, ""let us close the shop."" ",4399,4464
69,"They put up the shutters, and left. ",4464,4500
70,But they have not removed from the neighbourhood. ,4500,4550
71,In fact some people wish they had gone further. ,4550,4598
72,Ginger is living in the warren. ,4598,4630
73,I do not know what occupation he pursues; ,4630,4672
74, he looks stout and comfortable. ,4671,4704
75,Pickles is at present a gamekeeper. ,4704,4740
76,The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. ,4740,4792
77,Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; ,4792,4866
78, and she continued to refuse to give credit. ,4865,4910
79,"Of course there are the trades-men's carts--the butcher, the fish-man and Timothy Baker. ",4910,4999
80,"But a person cannot live on ""seed wigs"" and sponge-cake and butter-buns--not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy's! ",4999,5127
81,After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles. ,5127,5214
82,"But they did not keep ""self-fitting sixes"";",5214,5257
83, and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle. ,5257,5313
84,Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather. ,5313,5389
85,And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints. ,5389,5489
86,"And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but ""very snug;""",5489,5591
87,""" which is not the way to carry on a retail business. ",5590,5644
88,"So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to re-open the shop--""Henny's Opening Sale! ",5644,5788
89,Grand co-operative Jumble! ,5788,5815
90,Penny's penny prices! ,5815,5837
91,"Come buy, come try, come buy!"" ",5837,5868
92,The poster really was most ticing. ,5868,5903
93,There was a rush upon the opening day. ,5903,5942
94,"The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters. ",5942,6037
95,"Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; ",6037,6149
96, but she is quite harmless. ,6148,6176
97,And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains. ,6176,6233
98,There is something to please everybody.,6233,6273
