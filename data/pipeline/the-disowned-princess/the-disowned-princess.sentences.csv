0,"At the time that the Tang dynasty was reigning there lived a man named Liu I, who had failed to pass his examinations for the doctorate. ",0,137
1,So he traveled home again. ,137,164
2,"He had gone six or seven miles when a bird flew up in a field, and his horse shied and ran ten miles before he could stop him. ",164,291
3,There he saw a woman who was herding sheep on a hillside. ,291,349
4,"He looked at her and she was lovely to look upon, yet her face bore traces of hidden grief. ",349,441
5,"Astonished, he asked her what was the matter. ",441,487
6,"The woman began to sob and said: ""Fortune has forsaken me, and I am in need and ashamed. ",487,576
7,Since you are kind enough to ask I will tell you all. ,576,630
8,"I am the youngest daughter of the Dragon-King of the Sea of Dungting, and was married to the second son of the Dragon-King of Ging Dschou. ",630,769
9,Yet my husband ill-treated and disowned me. ,769,813
10,"I complained to my step-parents, but they loved their son blindly and did nothing. ",813,896
11,"And when I grew insistent they both became angry, and I was sent out here to herd sheep."" ",896,986
12,"When she had done, the woman burst into tears and lost all control of herself. ",986,1065
13,"Then she continued: ""The Sea of Dungting is far from here; ",1065,1124
14, yet I know that you will have to pass it on your homeward journey. ,1123,1191
15,"I should like to give you a letter to my father, but I do not know whether you would take it."" ",1191,1286
16,"Liu I answered: ""Your words have moved my heart. ",1286,1335
17,Would that I had wings and could fly away with you. ,1335,1387
18,I will be glad to deliver the letter to your father. ,1387,1440
19,"Yet the Sea of Dungting is long and broad, and how am I to find him?"" ",1440,1510
20,"""On the southern shore of the Sea stands an orange-tree,"" answered the woman, ""which people call the tree of sacrifice. ",1510,1630
21,When you get there you must loosen your girdle and strike the tree with it three times in succession. ,1630,1732
22,Then some one will appear whom you must follow. ,1732,1780
23,"When you see my father, tell him in what need you found me, and that I long greatly for his help."" ",1780,1879
24,Then she fetched out a letter from her breast and gave it to Liu I. ,1879,1947
25,"She bowed to him, looked toward the east and sighed, and, unexpectedly, the sudden tears rolled from the eyes of Liu I as well. ",1947,2075
26,He took the letter and thrust it in his bag. ,2075,2120
27,"Then he asked her: ""I cannot understand why you have to herd sheep. ",2120,2188
28,"Do the gods slaughter cattle like men?"" ",2188,2228
29,"""These are not ordinary sheep,"" answered the woman; ",2228,2280
30," ""these are rain-sheep."" ",2279,2304
31,"""But what are rain-sheep?"" ",2304,2331
32,"""They are the thunder-rams,"" replied the woman. ",2331,2379
33,"And when he looked more closely he noticed that these sheep walked around in proud, savage fashion, quite different from ordinary sheep. ",2379,2516
34,"Liu I added: ""But if I deliver the letter for you, and you succeed in getting back to the Sea of Dungting in safety, then you must not use me like a stranger."" ",2516,2676
35,"The woman answered: ""How could I use you as a stranger? ",2676,2732
36,"You shall be my dearest friend."" ",2732,2765
37,And with these words they parted. ,2765,2799
38,"In course of a month Liu I reached the Sea of Dungting, asked for the orange-tree and, sure enough, found it. ",2799,2909
39,"He loosened his girdle, and struck the tree with it three times. ",2909,2974
40,"At once a warrior emerged from the waves of the sea, and asked: ""Whence come you, honored guest?"" ",2974,3072
41,"Liu I said: ""I have come on an important mission and want to see the King."" ",3072,3148
42,"The warrior made a gesture in the direction of the water, and the waves turned into a solid street along which he led Liu I. ",3148,3273
43,"The dragon-castle rose before them with its thousand gates, and magic flowers and rare grasses bloomed in luxurious profusion. ",3273,3400
44,The warrior bade him wait at the side of a great hall. ,3400,3455
45,"Liu I asked: ""What is this place called?"" ",3455,3497
46,"""It is the Hall of the Spirits,"" was the reply. ",3497,3545
47,Liu I looked about him: all the jewels known to earth were there in abundance. ,3545,3624
48,"The columns were of white quartz, inlaid with green jade; ",3624,3682
49," the seats were made of coral, the curtains of mountain crystal as clear as water, the windows of burnished glass, adorned with rich lattice-work. ",3681,3828
50,"The beams of the ceiling, ornamented with amber, rose in wide arches. ",3828,3898
51,"An exotic fragrance filled the hall, whose outlines were lost in darkness. ",3898,3973
52,Liu I had waited for the king a long time. ,3973,4016
53,"To all his questions the warrior replied: ""Our master is pleased at this moment to talk with the priest of the sun up on the coral-tower about the sacred book of the fire. ",4016,4188
54,"He will, no doubt, soon be through."" ",4188,4225
55,"Liu I went on to ask: ""Why is he interested in the sacred book of the fire?"" ",4225,4302
56,"The reply was: ""Our master is a dragon. ",4302,4342
57,The dragons are powerful through the power of water. ,4342,4395
58,They can cover hill and dale with a single wave. ,4395,4444
59,The priest is a human being. ,4444,4473
60,Human beings are powerful through fire. ,4473,4513
61,They can burn the greatest palaces by means of a torch. ,4513,4569
62,"Fire and water fight each other, being different in their nature. ",4569,4635
63,"For that reason our master is now talking with the priest, in order to find a way in which fire and water may complete each other."" ",4635,4767
64,"Before they had quite finished there appeared a man in a purple robe, bearing a scepter of jade in his hand. ",4767,4876
65,"The warrior said: ""This is my master!"" ",4876,4915
66,Liu I bowed before him. ,4915,4939
67,"The king asked: ""Are you not a living human being? ",4939,4990
68,"What has brought you here?"" ",4990,5018
69,"Liu I gave his name and explained: ""I have been to the capital and there failed to pass my examination. ",5018,5122
70,"When I was passing by the Ging Dschou River, I saw your daughter, whom you love, herding sheep in the wilderness. ",5122,5236
71,"The winds tousled her hair, and the rain drenched her. ",5236,5291
72,I could not bear to see her trouble and spoke to her. ,5291,5345
73,She complained that her husband had cast her out and wept bitterly. ,5345,5413
74,Then she gave me a letter for you. ,5413,5448
75,"And that is why I have come to visit you, O King!"" ",5448,5499
76,With these words he fetched out his letter and handed it to the king. ,5499,5569
77,"When the latter had read it, he hid his face in his sleeve and said with a sigh: ""It is my own fault. ",5569,5671
78,I picked out a worthless husband for her. ,5671,5713
79,Instead of securing her happiness I have brought her to shame in a distant land. ,5713,5794
80,"You are a stranger and yet you have been willing to help her in her distress, for which I am very grateful to you."" ",5794,5910
81,"Then he once more began to sob, and all those about him shed tears. ",5910,5978
82,Thereupon the monarch gave the letter to a servant who took it into the interior of the palace; ,5978,6074
83, and soon the sound of loud lamentations rose from the inner rooms. ,6073,6141
84,"The king was alarmed and turned to an official: ""Go and tell them within not to weep so loudly! ",6141,6237
85,"I am afraid that Tsian Tang may hear them."" ",6237,6281
86,"""Who is Tsian Tang?"" ",6281,6302
87,asked Liu I. ,6302,6315
88,"""He is my beloved brother,"" answered the king. ",6315,6362
89,"""Formerly he was the ruler of the Tsian-Tang River, but now he has been deposed."" ",6362,6444
90,"Liu I asked: ""Why should the matter be kept from him?"" ",6444,6499
91,"""He is so wild and uncontrollable,"" was the reply, ""that I fear he would cause great damage. ",6499,6592
92,The deluge which covered the earth for nine long years in the time of the Emperor Yau was the work of his anger. ,6592,6705
93,"Because he fell out with one of the kings of heaven, he caused a great deluge that rose and covered the tops of five high mountains. ",6705,6838
94,"Then the king of heaven grew angry with him, and gave him to me to guard. ",6838,6912
95,"I had to chain him to a column in my palace."" ",6912,6958
96,"Before he had finished speaking a tremendous turmoil arose, which split the skies and made the earth tremble, so that the whole palace began to rock, and smoke and clouds rose hissing and puffing. ",6958,7155
97,"A red dragon, a thousand feet long, with flashing eyes, blood-red tongue, scarlet scales and a fiery beard came surging up. ",7155,7279
98,"He was dragging along through the air the column to which he had been bound, together with its chain. ",7279,7381
99,Thunders and lightnings roared and darted around his body; ,7381,7440
100," sleet and snow, rain and hail-stones whirled about him in confusion. ",7439,7509
101,"There was a crash of thunder, and he flew up to the skies and disappeared. ",7509,7584
102,Liu I fell to earth in terror. ,7584,7615
103,"The king helped him up with his own hand and said: ""Do not be afraid! ",7615,7685
104,"That is my brother, who is hastening to Ging Dschou in his rage. ",7685,7750
105,"We will soon have good news!"" ",7750,7780
106,Then he had food and drink brought in for his guest. ,7780,7833
107,"When the goblet had thrice made the rounds, a gentle breeze began to murmur and a fine rain fell. ",7833,7931
108,A youth clad in a purple gown and wearing a lofty hat entered. ,7931,7994
109,A sword hung at his side. ,7994,8020
110,His appearance was manly and heroic. ,8020,8057
111,"Behind him walked a girl radiantly beautiful, wearing a robe of misty fragrance. ",8057,8138
112,"And when Liu I looked at her, lo, it was the dragon-princess whom he had met on his way! ",8138,8227
113,"A throng of maidens in rosy garments received her, laughing and giggling, and led her into the interior of the palace. ",8227,8346
114,"The king, however, presented Liu I to the youth and said: ""This is Tsian Tang, my brother!"" ",8346,8438
115,Tsian Tang thanked him for having brought the message. ,8438,8493
116,"Then he turned to his brother and said: ""I have fought against the accursed dragons and have utterly defeated them!"" ",8493,8610
117,"""How many did you slay?"" ",8610,8635
118,"""Six hundred thousand."" ",8635,8659
119,"""Were any fields damaged?"" ",8659,8686
120,"""The fields were damaged for eight hundred miles around."" ",8686,8744
121,"""And where is the heartless husband?"" ",8744,8782
122,"""I ate him alive!"" ",8782,8801
123,"Then the king was alarmed and said: ""What the fickle boy did was not to be endured, it is true. ",8801,8897
124,But still you were a little too rough with him; ,8897,8945
125," in future you must not do anything of the sort again."" ",8944,9000
126,And Tsian Tang promised not to. ,9000,9032
127,That evening Liu I was feasted at the castle. ,9032,9078
128,Music and dancing lent charm to the banquet. ,9078,9123
129,A thousand warriors with banners and spears in their hands stood at attention. ,9123,9202
130,"Trombones and trumpets resounded, and drums and kettledrums thundered and rattled as the warriors danced a war-dance. ",9202,9320
131,"The music expressed how Tsian Tang had broken through the ranks of the enemy, and the hair of the guest who listened to it rose on his head in terror. ",9320,9471
132,"Then, again, there was heard the music of strings, flutes and little golden bells. ",9471,9554
133,A thousand maidens in crimson and green silk danced around. ,9554,9614
134,The return of the princess was also told in tones. ,9614,9665
135,"The music sounded like a song of sadness and plaining, and all who heard it were moved to tears. ",9665,9762
136,The King of the Sea of Dungting was filled with joy. ,9762,9815
137,"He raised his goblet and drank to the health of his guest, and all sorrow departed from them. ",9815,9909
138,"Both rulers thanked Liu I in verses, and Liu I answered them in a rimed toast. ",9909,9988
139,The crowd of courtiers in the palace-hall applauded. ,9988,10041
140,"Then the King of the Sea of Dungting drew forth a blue cloud-casket in which was the horn of a rhinoceros, which divides the water. ",10041,10173
141,Tsian Tang brought out a platter of red amber on which lay a carbuncle. ,10173,10245
142,"These they presented to their guest, and the other inmates of the palace also heaped up embroideries, brocades and pearls by his side. ",10245,10380
143,"Surrounded by shimmer and light Liu I sat there, smiling, and bowed his thanks to all sides. ",10380,10473
144,When the banquet was ended he slept in the Palace of Frozen Radiance. ,10473,10543
145,On the following day another banquet was held. ,10543,10590
146,"Tsian Tang, who was not quite himself, sat carelessly on his seat and said: ""The Princess of the Dungting Sea is handsome and delicately fashioned. ",10590,10738
147,"She has had the misfortune to be disowned by her husband, and to-day her marriage is annulled. ",10738,10833
148,I should like to find another husband for her. ,10833,10880
149,If you were agreeable it would be to your advantage. ,10880,10933
150,"But if you were not willing to marry her, you may go your way, and should we ever meet again we will not know each other."" ",10933,11056
151,Liu I was angered by the careless way in which Tsian Tang spoke to him. ,11056,11128
152,"The blood rose to his head and he replied: ""I served as a messenger, because I felt sorry for the princess, but not in order to gain an advantage for myself. ",11128,11286
153,To kill a husband and carry off a wife is something an honest man does not do. ,11286,11365
154,"And since I am only an ordinary man, I prefer to die rather than do as you say."" ",11365,11446
155,"Tsian Tang rose, apologized and said: ""My words were over-hasty. ",11446,11511
156,"I hope you will not take them ill!"" ",11511,11547
157,"And the King of the Dungting Sea also spoke kindly to him, and censured Tsian Tang because of his rude speech. ",11547,11658
158,So there was no more said about marriage. ,11658,11700
159,"On the following day Liu I took his leave, and the Queen of the Dungting Sea gave a farewell banquet in his honor. ",11700,11815
160,"With tears the queen said to Liu I: ""My daughter owes you a great debt of gratitude, and we have not had an opportunity to make it up to you. ",11815,11957
161,"Now you are going away and we see you go with heavy hearts!"" ",11957,12018
162,Then she ordered the princess to thank Liu I. ,12018,12064
163,"The princess stood there, blushing, bowed to him and said: ""We will probably never see each other again!"" ",12064,12170
164,Then tears choked her voice. ,12170,12199
165,"It is true that Liu I had resisted the stormy urging of her uncle, but when he saw the princess standing before him in all the charm of her loveliness, he felt sad at heart; ",12199,12373
166, yet he controlled himself and went his way. ,12372,12417
167,The treasures which he took with him were incalculable. ,12417,12473
168,The king and his brother themselves escorted him as far as the river. ,12473,12543
169,"When, on his return home, he sold no more than a hundredth part of what he had received, his fortune already ran into the millions, and he was wealthier than all his neighbors. ",12543,12720
170,"He decided to take a wife, and heard of a widow who lived in the North with her daughter. ",12720,12810
171,Her father had become a Taoist in his later years and had vanished in the clouds without ever returning. ,12810,12915
172,The mother lived in poverty with the daughter; ,12915,12962
173, yet since the girl was beautiful beyond measure she was seeking a distinguished husband for her. ,12961,13059
174,"Liu I was content to take her, and the day of the wedding was set. ",13059,13126
175,"And when he saw his bride unveiled on the evening of her wedding day, she looked just like the dragon-princess. ",13126,13238
176,"He asked her about it, but she merely smiled and said nothing. ",13238,13301
177,After a time heaven sent them a son. ,13301,13338
178,"Then she told her husband: ""To-day I will confess to you that I am truly the Princess of Dungting Sea. ",13338,13441
179,"When you had rejected my uncle's proposal and gone away, I fell ill of longing, and was near death. ",13441,13541
180,"My parents wanted to send for you, but they feared you might take exception to my family. ",13541,13631
181,And so it was that I married you disguised as a human maiden. ,13631,13693
182,"I had not ventured to tell you until now, but since heaven has sent us a son, I hope that you will love his mother as well."" ",13693,13818
183,"Then Liu I awoke as though from a deep sleep, and from that time on both were very fond of each other. ",13818,13921
184,"One day his wife said: ""If you wish to stay with me eternally, then we cannot continue to dwell in the world of men. ",13921,14038
185,"We dragons live ten thousand years, and you shall share our longevity. ",14038,14109
186,"Come back with me to the Sea of Dungting!"" ",14109,14152
187,"Ten years passed and no one knew where Liu I, who had disappeared, might be. ",14152,14229
188,"Then, by accident, a relative went sailing across the Sea of Dungting. ",14229,14300
189,Suddenly a blue mountain rose up out of the water. ,14300,14351
190,"The seamen cried in alarm: ""There is no mountain on this spot! ",14351,14414
191,"It must be a water-demon!"" ",14414,14441
192,"While they were still pointing to it and talking, the mountain drew near the ship, and a gaily-colored boat slid from its summit into the water. ",14441,14586
193,"A man sat in the middle, and fairies stood at either side of him. ",14586,14652
194,The man was Liu I. ,14652,14671
195,"He beckoned to his cousin, and the latter drew up his garments and stepped into the boat with him. ",14671,14770
196,But when he had entered the boat it turned into a mountain. ,14770,14830
197,"On the mountain stood a splendid castle, and in the castle stood Liu I, surrounded with radiance, and with the music of stringed instruments floating about him. ",14830,14991
198,"They greeted each other, and Liu I said to his cousin: ""We have been parted no more than a moment, and your hair is already gray!"" ",14991,15122
199,"His cousin answered: ""You are a god and blessed: I have only a mortal body. ",15122,15198
200,"Thus fate has decreed."" ",15198,15222
201,"Then Liu I gave him fifty pills and said: ""Each pill will extend your life for the space of a year. ",15222,15322
202,"When you have lived the tale of these years, come to me and dwell no longer in the earthly world of dust, where there is nothing but toil and trouble."" ",15322,15474
203,Then he took him back across the sea and disappeared. ,15474,15528
204,"His cousin, however, retired from the world, and fifty years later, and when he had taken all the pills, he disappeared and was never seen again.",15528,15674
