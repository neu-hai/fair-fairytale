0,"Once upon a time there lived at Vaero, not far from Rost, a poor fisherman, named Isaac. ",0,89
1,"He had nothing but a boat and a couple of goats, which his wife fed as well as she could with fish leavings, and with the grass she was able to gather on the surrounding hills. ",89,266
2,But his whole hut was full of hungry children. ,266,313
3,Yet he was always satisfied with what God sent him. ,313,365
4,The only thing that worried him was his inability to live at peace with his neighbor. ,365,451
5,"The latter was a rich man, thought himself entitled to far more than such a beggarly fellow as Isaac. ",451,553
6,"He wanted to get him out of the way, in order to take for himself the anchorage before Isaac's hut. ",553,653
7,"One day Isaac had put out a few miles to sea to fish, when suddenly a dark fog fell. ",653,738
8,"In a flash such a tremendous storm broke, that he had to throw all his fish overboard in order to lighten ship and save his life. ",738,868
9,Even then it was very hard to keep the boat afloat. ,868,920
10,"He steered a careful course between and across the mountainous waves, which seemed ready to swallow him from moment to moment. ",920,1047
11,"After he had kept on for five or six hours in this manner, he thought that he ought to touch land somewhere. ",1047,1156
12,"But time went by, and the storm and fog grew worse and worse. ",1156,1218
13,"Then he began to realize that either he was steering out to sea, or that the wind had veered, and at last he made sure the latter was the case. ",1218,1362
14,He sailed on and on without a sight of land. ,1362,1407
15,"Suddenly he heard a hideous cry from the stern of the boat, and felt certain that it was the drang, who was singing his death-song. ",1407,1539
16,"Then he prayed God to guard his wife and children, for he thought his last hour had come. ",1539,1629
17,"As he sat there and prayed, he made out something black. ",1629,1686
18,"When his boat drew nearer, he noticed that it was only three cormorants, sitting on a piece of drift-wood and--swish! ",1686,1804
19,he had passed them. ,1804,1824
20,"Thus he sailed for a long time, and grew so hungry, so thirsty and so weary that he did not know what to do. ",1824,1933
21,The most part he sat with the rudder in his hand and slept. ,1933,1993
22,But all of a sudden the boat ran up on a beach and stopped. ,1993,2053
23,Then Isaac opened his eyes. ,2053,2081
24,"The sun broke through the fog, and shone on a beautiful land. ",2081,2143
25,"Its hills and mountains were green to their very tops, fields and meadows lay among their slopes. ",2143,2241
26,He seemed to breathe a fragrance of flowers and grass sweeter than any he had ever known before. ,2241,2338
27,"""God be praised, now I am safe, for this is Udrost!"" ",2338,2391
28,said Isaac to himself. ,2391,2414
29,"Directly ahead of him lay a field of barley, with ears so large and heavy that he had never seen their like. ",2414,2523
30,"Through the barley-field a narrow path led to a green turf-roofed cottage of clay, that rose above the field. ",2523,2633
31,"On the roof of the cottage grazed a white goat with gilded horns, and an udder as large as that of the largest cow. ",2633,2749
32,"Before the door sat a little man clad in blue, puffing away at a little pipe. ",2749,2827
33,He had a beard so long and so large that it hung far down upon his breast. ,2827,2902
34,"""Welcome to Udrost, Isaac!"" ",2902,2930
35,said the man. ,2930,2944
36,"""Good day to you, father,"" said Isaac, ""and do you know me?"" ",2944,3005
37,"""It might be that I do,"" said the man. ",3005,3044
38,"""I suppose you want to stay here overnight?"" ",3044,3089
39,"""That would suit me very well, father,"" was Isaac's reply. ",3089,3148
40,"""The trouble is with my sons, for they cannot bear the smell of a Christian,"" answered the man. ",3148,3244
41,"""Did you meet them?"" ",3244,3265
42,"""No, I only met three cormorants, who were sitting on a piece of drift-wood and croaking,"" was Isaac's reply. ",3265,3375
43,"""Well, those were my sons,"" said the man, and emptied his pipe, ""and now come into the house, for I think you must be hungry and thirsty."" ",3375,3514
44,"""I'll take that liberty, father,"" said Isaac. ",3514,3560
45,"When the man opened the door, everything within was so beautiful that Isaac could not get over his admiration. ",3560,3671
46,He had never seen anything like it. ,3671,3707
47,"The table was covered with the finest dishes, bowls of cream, and salmon and game, and liver dumplings with syrup, and cheese as well, and there were whole piles of doughnuts, and there was mead, and everything else that is good. ",3707,3937
48,"Isaac ate and drank bravely, and yet his plate was never empty. ",3937,4001
49,"No matter how much he drank, his glass was always full. ",4001,4057
50,The man neither ate much nor said much; ,4057,4097
51," but suddenly they heard a noise and clamor before the house, and the man went out. ",4096,4180
52,"After a time he returned with his three sons, and Isaac trembled inwardly when they came through the door. ",4180,4287
53,"Their father must have quieted them, for they were very friendly and amiable, and told Isaac he must use his guest-right, and sit down and drink with them; ",4287,4443
54," for Isaac had risen to leave the table, saying he had satisfied his hunger. ",4442,4519
55,"But he gave in to them, and they drank mead together, and became good friends. ",4519,4598
56,"And they said that Isaac must go fishing with them, so that he would have something to take with him when he went home. ",4598,4718
57,The first time they put out a great storm was raging. ,4718,4772
58,"One of the sons sat at the rudder, the second at the bow, and the third in the middle. ",4772,4859
59,Isaac had to work with the bailing-can until he dripped perspiration. ,4859,4929
60,They sailed as though they were mad. ,4929,4966
61,"They never reefed a sail, and when the boat was full of water, they danced on the crests of the waves, and slid down them so that the water in the stern spurted up like a fountain. ",4966,5147
62,"After a time the storm subsided, and they began to fish. ",5147,5204
63,"And the sea was so full of fish that they could not even put out an anchor, since mountains of fish were piled up beneath them. ",5204,5332
64,The sons of Udrost drew up one fish after another. ,5332,5383
65,Isaac knew his business; ,5383,5408
66," but he had taken along his own fishing-tackle, and as soon as a fish bit he let go again, and at last he had caught not a single one. ",5407,5542
67,"When the boat was filled, they sailed home again to Udrost, and the sons cleaned the fish, and laid them on the stands. ",5542,5662
68,Meanwhile Isaac had complained to their father of his poor luck. ,5662,5727
69,"The man promised that he should do better next time, and gave him a couple of hooks. ",5727,5812
70,"The next time they went out to fish, Isaac caught just as many as the others, and when they reached home, he was given three stands of fish as his share. ",5812,5966
71,At length Isaac began to get homesick. ,5966,6005
72,"When he was about to leave, the man made him a present of a new fishing-boat, full of meal, and tackle and other useful things. ",6005,6133
73,"Isaac thanked him repeatedly, and the man invited him to come back when the season opened again, since he himself was going to take a cargo to Bergen, in the second stevne, and Isaac could go along and sell his fish there himself. ",6133,6364
74,"Isaac was more than willing, and asked him what course he should set when he again wanted to reach Udrost. ",6364,6471
75,"""All you need do is to follow the cormorant when he heads for the open sea, then you will be on the right course,"" said the man. ",6471,6600
76,"""Good luck on your way!"" ",6600,6625
77,"But when Isaac got underway, and looked around, there was no Udrost in sight. ",6625,6703
78,"Far and wide, all around him, he saw no more than the ocean. ",6703,6764
79,"When the time came, Isaac sailed to join the man of Udrost's fishing-craft. ",6764,6840
80,But such a craft he had never seen before. ,6840,6883
81,"It was two hails long, so that when the steersman, who was on look-out in the stern, wanted to call out something to the rower, the latter could not hear him. ",6883,7042
82,"So they had stationed another man in the middle of the ship, close by the mast, who had to relay the steersman's call to the rower, and even he had to shout as loudly as he could in order to make himself heard. ",7042,7253
83,Isaac's share was laid down in the forepart of the boat; ,7253,7310
84, and he himself took down the fish from the stands; ,7309,7361
85," yet he could not understand how it was that the stands were continually filled with fresh fish, no matter how many he took away, and when he sailed away they were still as full as ever. ",7360,7547
86,"When he reached Bergen, he sold his fish, and got so much money for them that he was able to buy a new schooner, completely fitted out, and with a cargo to boot, as the man of Udrost had advised him. ",7547,7747
87,"Late in the evening, when he was about to sail for home, the man came aboard and told him never to forget those who survived his neighbor, for his neighbor himself had died. ",7747,7921
88,"Then he wished Isaac all possible success and good fortune for his schooner, in advance. ",7921,8010
89,"""All is well, and all stands firm that towers in the air,"" said he, and what he meant was that there was one aboard whom none could see, but who would support the mast on his back, if need be. ",8010,8203
90,Since that time fortune was Isaac's friend. ,8203,8247
91,"And well he knew why this was so, and never forgot to prepare something good for whoever held the winter watch, when the schooner was drawn up on land in the fall. ",8247,8411
92,"And every Christmas night there was the glow and shimmer of light, the sound of fiddles and music, of laughter and merriment, and of dancing on the deserted schooner.",8411,8578
