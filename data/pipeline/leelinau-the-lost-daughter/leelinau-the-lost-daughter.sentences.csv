0,"Leelinau was the favorite daughter of a hunter, who lived on the lake shore near the base of the lofty highlands, called Kaug Wudjoo. ",0,134
1,From her earliest youth she was observed to be thoughtful and retiring. ,134,206
2,"She passed much of her time in solitude, and seemed ever to prefer the companionship of her own shadow to the society of the lodge-circle. ",206,345
3,"Whenever she could leave her father's lodge she would fly to remote haunts and recesses in the woods, or sit in lonely reverie upon some high promontory of rock overlooking the lake. ",345,528
4,"In such places she would often, with her face turned upward, linger long in contemplation of the air, as if she were invoking her guardian spirit, and beseeching him to lighten her sadness. ",528,718
5,"But amid all the leafy haunts, none drew her steps toward it so often as a forest of pines, on the open shore, called Manitowok, or the Sacred Wood. ",718,867
6,"It was one of those hallowed places which is the resort of the little wild men of the woods, and of the turtle spirits or fairies which delight in romantic scenes. ",867,1031
7,"Owing to this circumstance, its green retirement was seldom visited by Indians, who feared to fall under the influence of its mischievous inhabitants. ",1031,1182
8,"And whenever they were compelled by stress of weather to make a landing on this part of the coast, they never failed to leave an offering of tobacco, or some other token, to show that they desired to stand well with the proprietors of the fairy ground. ",1182,1435
9,"To this sacred spot Leelinau had made her way at an early age, gathering strange flowers and plants, which she would bring home to her parents, and relate to them all the haps and mishaps that had occurred in her rambles. ",1435,1657
10,"Although they discountenanced her frequent visits to the place, they were not able to restrain them, for she was of so gentle and delicate a temper that they feared to thwart her. ",1657,1837
11,"Her attachment to the fairy wood, therefore, grew with her years. ",1837,1903
12,"If she wished to solicit her spirits to procure pleasant dreams, or any other maiden favor, Leelinau repaired to the Manitowok. ",1903,2031
13,"If her father remained abroad in the hunt later than usual, and it was feared that he had been overwhelmed by the tempest, or had met with some other mischance, Leelinau offered up her prayers for safety at the Manitowok. ",2031,2253
14,"It was there that she fasted, mused, and strolled. ",2253,2304
15,"She at length became so engrossed by the fairy pines that her parents began to suspect that some evil spirit had enticed her to its haunts, and had cast upon her a charm which she had not the power to resist. ",2304,2513
16,"This belief was confirmed when, one day, her mother, who had secretly followed her, overheard her murmuring to some unknown and invisible companion, appeals like these: ""Spirit of the dancing leaves!"" ",2513,2714
17,"whispered Leelinau, ""hear a throbbing heart in its sadness. ",2714,2774
18,Spirit of the foaming stream! ,2774,2804
19,"visit thou my nightly pillow, shedding over it silver dreams of mountain brook and pebbly rivulet. ",2804,2903
20,Spirit of the starry night! ,2903,2931
21,"lead my foot-prints to the blushing mis-kodeed, or where the burning passion-flower shines with carmine hue. ",2931,3040
22,"Spirit of the greenwood plume!"" ",3040,3072
23,"she concluded, turning with passionate gaze to the beautiful young pines which stood waving their green beauty over her head, ""shed on me, on Leelinau the sad, thy leafy fragrance, such as spring unfolds from sweetest flowers, or hearts that to each other show their inmost grief. ",3072,3353
24,Spirits! ,3353,3362
25,"hear, O hear a maiden's prayer!"" ",3362,3395
26,"Day by day, these strange communings with unseen beings drew away the heart of Leelinau more and more from the simple duties of the lodge, and she walked among her people, melancholy and silent, like a spirit who had visited them from another land. ",3395,3644
27,"The pastimes which engaged the frolic moments of her young companions, passed by her as little trivial pageants in which she had no concern. ",3644,3785
28,"When the girls of the neighboring lodges assembled to play at the favorite female game of pappus-e-ko-waun, or the block and string, before the lodge-door, Leelinau would sit vacantly by, or enter so feebly into the spirit of the play as to show that it was irksome to her. ",3785,4059
29,"Again, in the evening, when the young people formed a ring around the lodge, and the piepeend-jigun, or leather and bone, passed rapidly from one to the other, she either handed it along without attempting to play, or if she took a part, it was with no effort to succeed. ",4059,4331
30,"The time of the corn-gathering had come, and the young people of the tribe were assembled in the field, busy in plucking the ripened maize. ",4331,4471
31,"One of the girls, noted for her beauty, had found a red ear, and every one congratulated her that a brave admirer was on his way to her father's lodge. ",4471,4623
32,"She blushed, and hiding the trophy in her bosom, she thanked the Good Spirit that it was a red ear, and not a crooked, that she had found. ",4623,4762
33,"Presently it chanced that one who was there among the young men, espied in the hands of Leelinau, who had plucked it indifferently, one of the crooked kind, and at once the word ""Wa-ge-min!"" ",4762,4953
34,"was shouted aloud through the field, and the whole circle was set in a roar. ",4953,5030
35,"""The thief is in the corn-field!"" ",5030,5064
36,"exclaimed the young man, Iagoo by name, and famous in the tribe for his mirthful powers of story-telling; ",5064,5170
37," ""see you not the old man stooping as he enters the field? ",5169,5228
38,See you not signs that he crouched as he crept in the dark? ,5228,5288
39,Is it not plain by this mark on the stalk that he was heavily bent in his back? ,5288,5368
40,Old man! ,5368,5377
41,"be nimble, or some one will take thee while thou art taking the ear."" ",5377,5447
42,These questions Iagoo accompanied with the action of one bowed with age stealthily entering the corn-field. ,5447,5555
43,"He went on: ""See how he stoops as he breaks off the ear. ",5555,5612
44,Nushka! ,5612,5620
45,He seems for a moment to tremble. ,5620,5654
46,"Walker, be nimble! ",5654,5673
47,Hooh! ,5673,5679
48,"It is plain the old man is the thief."" ",5679,5718
49,"He turned suddenly where she sat in the circle, pensively regarding the crooked ear which she held in her hand, and exclaimed: ""Leelinau, the old man is thine!"" ",5718,5879
50,"Laughter rung merrily through the corn-field, but Leelinau, casting down upon the ground the crooked ear of maize, walked pensively away. ",5879,6017
51,The next morning the eldest son of a neighboring chief called at her father's lodge. ,6017,6102
52,He was quite advanced in years; ,6102,6134
53," but he enjoyed such renown in battle, and his name was so famous in the hunt, that the parents accepted him as a suitor for their daughter. ",6133,6274
54,They hoped that his shining qualities would draw back the thoughts of Leelinau from that spirit-land whither she seemed to have wholly directed her affections. ,6274,6434
55,"It was this chief's son whom Iagoo had pictured as the corn-taker, but, without objecting to his age, or giving any other reason, Leelinau firmly declined his proposals. ",6434,6604
56,"The parents ascribed the young daughter's hesitancy to maiden fear, and paying no further heed to her refusal, a day was fixed for the marriage-visit to the lodge. ",6604,6768
57,"The young warrior came to the lodge-door, and Leelinau refused to see him; ",6768,6843
58," informing her parents, at the same time, that she would never consent to the match. ",6842,6927
59,"It had been her custom to pass many of her hours in her favorite place of retirement, under a broad-topped young pine, whose leaves whispered in every wind that blew; ",6927,7094
60," but most of all in that gentle murmur of the air at the evening hour, dear to lovers, when the twilight steals on. ",7093,7209
61,"Thither she now repaired, and, while reclining pensively against the young pine-tree, she fancied that she heard a voice addressing her. ",7209,7346
62,At first it was scarcely more than a sigh; ,7346,7389
63," presently it grew more clear, and she heard it distinctly whisper-- ""Maiden! ",7388,7466
64,think me not a tree; ,7466,7487
65, but thine own dear lover; ,7486,7513
66," fond to be with thee in my tall and blooming strength, with the bright green nodding plume that waves above thee. ",7512,7627
67,"Thou art leaning on my breast, Leelinau; ",7627,7668
68, lean forever there and be at peace. ,7667,7704
69,"Fly from men who are false and cruel, and quit the tumult of their dusty strife, for this quiet, lonely shade. ",7704,7815
70,"Over thee I my arms will fling, fairer than the lodge's roof. ",7815,7877
71,I will breathe a perfume like that of flowers over thy happy evening rest. ,7877,7952
72,In my bark canoe I'll waft thee o'er the waters of the sky-blue lake. ,7952,8022
73,I will deck the folds of thy mantle with the sun's last rays. ,8022,8084
74,"Come, and on the mountain free rove a fairy bright with me!"" ",8084,8145
75,Leelinau drunk in with eager ear these magical words. ,8145,8199
76,Her heart was fixed. ,8199,8220
77,No warrior's son should clasp her hand. ,8220,8260
78,She listened in the hope to hear the airy voice speak more; ,8260,8320
79," but it only repeated, ""Again! ",8319,8350
80,"again!"" ",8350,8358
81,and entirely ceased. ,8358,8379
82,"On the eve of the day fixed for her marriage, Leelinau decked herself in her best garments. ",8379,8471
83,"She arranged her hair according to the fashion of her tribe, and put on all of her maiden ornaments in beautiful array. ",8471,8591
84,"With a smile, she presented herself before her parents. ",8591,8647
85,"""I am going,"" she said, ""to meet my little lover, the chieftain of the Green Plume, who is waiting for me at the Spirit Grove."" ",8647,8775
86,"Her face was radiant with joy, and the parents, taking what she had said as her own fanciful way of expressing acquiescence in their plans, wished her good fortune in the happy meeting. ",8775,8961
87,"""I am going,"" she continued, addressing her mother as they left the lodge, ""I am going from one who has watched my infancy and guarded my youth; ",8961,9106
88," who has given me medicine when I was sick, and prepared my food when I was well. ",9105,9187
89,"I am going from a father who has ranged the forest to procure the choicest skins for my dress, and kept his lodge supplied with the best spoil of the chase. ",9187,9344
90,"I am going from a lodge which has been my shelter from the storms of winter, and my shield from the heats of summer. ",9344,9461
91,"Farewell, my parents, farewell!"" ",9461,9494
92,"So saying, she sped faster than any could follow her to the margin of the fairy wood, and in a moment was lost to sight. ",9494,9615
93,"As she had often thus withdrawn herself from the lodge, the parents were not in fear, but confidently awaited her return. ",9615,9737
94,"Hour chased hour, as the clouds of evening rolled up in the west; ",9737,9803
95," darkness came on, but no daughter returned. ",9802,9847
96,"With torches they hastened to the wood, and although they lit up every dark recess and leafy gloom, their search was in vain. ",9847,9973
97,Leelinau was nowhere to be seen. ,9973,10006
98,"They called aloud, in lament, upon her name, but she answered not. ",10006,10073
99,"Suns rose and set, but nevermore in their light did the bereaved parents eyes behold the lost form of their beloved child. ",10073,10196
100,Their daughter was lost indeed. ,10196,10228
101,Whither she had vanished no mortal tongue could tell; ,10228,10282
102," although it chanced that a company of fishermen, who were spearing fish near the Spirit Grove, descried something that seemed to resemble a female figure standing on the shore. ",10281,10459
103,"As the evening was mild and the waters calm, they cautiously pulled their canoe toward land, but the slight ripple of their oars excited alarm. ",10459,10603
104,"The figure fled in haste, but they could recognize in the shape and dress as she ascended the bank, the lost daughter, and they saw the green plumes of her fairy-lover waving over his forehead as he glided lightly through the forest of young pines.",10603,10852
