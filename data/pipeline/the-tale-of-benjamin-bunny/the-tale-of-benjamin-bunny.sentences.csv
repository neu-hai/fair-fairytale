0,ONE morning a little rabbit sat on a bank. ,0,43
1,"He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony. ",43,115
2,A gig was coming along the road; ,115,148
3," it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet. ",147,232
4,"AS soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden. ",232,437
5,THAT wood was full of rabbit holes; ,437,473
6," and in the neatest sandiest hole of all, cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter. ",472,561
7,Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; ,561,590
8, she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffetees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). ,589,694
9,"She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what WE call lavender). ",694,786
10,LITTLE Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt. ,786,842
11,"He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter. ",842,935
12,PETER was sitting by himself. ,935,965
13,"He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief. ",965,1036
14,"""Peter,""--said little Benjamin, in a whisper--""who has got your clothes?"" ",1036,1110
15,"PETER replied--""The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,"" and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat. ",1110,1258
16,"Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin, and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; ",1258,1383
17," and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet. ",1382,1451
18,PETER said he hoped that it would rain. ,1451,1491
19,"At this point, old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole calling--""Cotton-tail! ",1491,1586
20,Cotton-tail! ,1573,1586
21,"fetch some more camomile!"" ",1599,1626
22,Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk. ,1626,1692
23,"THEY went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. ",1692,1786
24,From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden. ,1786,1841
25,"Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o-shanter of Mr. McGregor's. ",1841,1960
26,"LITTLE Benjamin said, ""It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; ",1960,2035
27," the proper way to get in, is to climb down a pear tree."" ",2034,2092
28,Peter fell down head first; ,2092,2120
29," but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft. ",2119,2199
30,IT had been sown with lettuces. ,2199,2231
31,"They left a great many odd little foot-marks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs. ",2231,2345
32,"LITTLE Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket handkerchief. ",2345,2496
33,They took them off the scarecrow. ,2496,2530
34,There had been rain during the night; ,2530,2568
35," there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk. ",2567,2632
36,"Benjamin tried on the tam-o-shanter, but it was too big for him. ",2632,2697
37,"THEN he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt. ",2697,2808
38,Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; ,2808,2851
39, he kept hearing noises. ,2850,2875
40,"BENJAMIN, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. ",2875,2949
41,He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner. ,2949,3063
42,(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.) ,3063,3128
43,The lettuces certainly were very fine. ,3128,3167
44,PETER did not eat anything; ,3167,3195
45, he said he should like to go home. ,3194,3230
46,Presently he dropped half the onions. ,3230,3268
47,"LITTLE Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree, with a load of vegetables. ",3268,3371
48,He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. ,3371,3430
49,"They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny red-brick wall. ",3430,3501
50,"The mice sat on their door-steps cracking cherry-stones, they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny. ",3501,3613
51,PRESENTLY Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again. ,3613,3667
52,"THEY got amongst flower-pots, and frames and tubs; ",3667,3718
53," Peter heard noises worse than ever, his eyes were as big as lolly-pops! ",3717,3790
54,"He was a step or two in front of his cousin, when he suddenly stopped. ",3790,3861
55,THIS is what those little rabbits saw round that corner! ,3861,3918
56,"Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket.... ",3918,4065
57,"THE cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket. ",4065,4139
58,Perhaps she liked the smell of onions! ,4139,4178
59,"Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket. ",4178,4227
60,SHE sat there for FIVE HOURS. ,4227,4257
61,"I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; ",4257,4402
62, it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry. ,4401,4448
63,"The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; ",4448,4523
64, but still the cat sat upon the basket. ,4522,4562
65,"AT length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above. ",4562,4664
66,The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace. ,4664,4770
67,"He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand. ",4770,4848
68,He was looking for his son.v OLD Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats. ,4848,4924
69,"He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the garden-house, scratching off a handful of fur. ",4924,5100
70,The cat was too much surprised to scratch back. ,5100,5148
71,"WHEN old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house, he locked the door. ",5148,5228
72,"Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch. ",5228,5343
73,Then he took out his nephew Peter. ,5343,5378
74,"THEN he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden. ",5378,5454
75,"When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later, he observed several things which perplexed him. ",5454,5555
76,It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the foot-marks were too ridiculously little! ,5555,5694
77,"Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the green-house, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE. ",5694,5832
78,"WHEN Peter got home, his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. ",5832,5946
79,"Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the rabbit-tobacco.",5946,6109
