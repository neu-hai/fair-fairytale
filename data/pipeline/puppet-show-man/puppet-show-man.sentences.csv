0,"On board a steamer I once met an elderly man, with such a merry face that, if it was really an index of his mind, he must have been the happiest fellow in creation. ",0,165
1,"indeed he considered himself so, for I heard it from his own mouth. ",165,233
2,"He was a Dane, the owner of a travelling theatre. ",233,283
3,"He had all his company with him in a large box, for he was the proprietor of a puppet-show. ",283,375
4,"His inborn cheerfulness, he said, had been tested by a member of the Polytechnic Institution, and the experiment had made him completely happy. ",375,519
5,"I did not at first understand all this, but afterwards he explained the whole story to me. ",519,610
6,"Here it is:-- ""I was giving a representation,"" he said, ""in the hall of the posting-house in the little town of Slagelse. ",610,732
7,"There was a splendid audience, entirely juvenile excepting two respectable matrons. ",732,816
8,"All at once, a person in black, of student-like appearance, entered the room, and sat down. ",816,908
9,"He laughed aloud at the telling points, and applauded quite at the proper time. ",908,988
10,"This was a very unusual spectator for me, and I felt anxious to know who he was. ",988,1069
11,"I heard that he was a member of the Polytechnic Institution in Copenhagen, who had been sent out to lecture to the people in the provinces. ",1069,1209
12,"Punctually at eight o'clock my performance closed, for children must go early to bed, and a manager must also consult the convenience of the public. ",1209,1358
13,"""At nine o'clock the lecturer commenced his lecture and his experiments, and then I formed a part of his audience. ",1358,1473
14,It was wonderful both to hear and to see. ,1473,1515
15,"The greater part of it was beyond my comprehension, but it led me to think that if we men can acquire so much, we must surely be intended to last longer than the little span which extends only to the time when we are hidden away under the earth. ",1515,1761
16,"His experiments were quite miracles on a small scale, and yet the explanations flowed as naturally as water from his lips. ",1761,1884
17,"At the time of Moses and the prophets, such a man would have been placed among the sages of the land; ",1884,1986
18, in the middle ages they would have burnt him at the stake. ,1985,2045
19,"""All night long I could not sleep. ",2045,2080
20,"The next evening when I gave another performance and the lecturer was present, I was in one of my best moods. ",2080,2190
21,"""I once heard of an actor, who, when he had to act the part of a lover, always thought of one particular lady in the audience. ",2190,2317
22,"He only played for her, and forgot all the rest of the house, and now the Polytechnic lecturer was my she, my only auditor, for whom alone I played. ",2317,2466
23,"""When the performance was over, and the puppets removed behind the curtain, the Polytechnic lecturer invited me into his room to take a glass of wine. ",2466,2617
24,"He talked of my comedies, and I of his science, and I believe we were both equally pleased. ",2617,2709
25,"But I had the best of it, for there was much in what he did that he could not always explain to me. ",2709,2809
26,"For instance, why a piece of iron which is rubbed on a cylinder, should become magnetic. ",2809,2898
27,How does this happen? ,2898,2920
28,"The magnetic sparks come to it,--but how? ",2920,2962
29,It is the same with people in the world; ,2962,3003
30," they are rubbed about on this spherical globe till the electric spark comes upon them, and then we have a Napoleon, or a Luther, or some one of the kind. ",3002,3157
31,"""'The whole world is but a series of miracles,' said the lecturer, 'but we are so accustomed to them that we call them everyday matters.' ",3157,3295
32,And he went on explaining things to me till my skull seemed lifted from my brain. ,3295,3377
33,"I declared that were I not such an old fellow, I would at once become a member of the Polytechnic Institution, that I might learn to look at the bright side of everything, although I was one of the happiest of men. ",3377,3592
34,"""'One of the happiest!' ",3592,3616
35,"said the lecturer, as if the idea pleased him. ",3616,3663
36,'Are you really happy?' ,3663,3687
37,"""'Yes,' I replied; ",3687,3706
38," 'for I am welcomed in every town, when I arrive with my company. ",3705,3771
39,But I certainly have one wish which sometimes weighs upon my cheerful temper like a mountain of lead. ,3771,3873
40,"I should like to become the manager of a real theatre, and the director of a real troupe of men and women.' ",3873,3981
41,"""'I understand,' he said; ",3981,4007
42," 'you would like to have life breathed into your puppets, so that they might be living actors, and you their director. ",4006,4125
43,And would you then be quite happy?' ,4125,4161
44,"""I said I believed so. ",4161,4184
45,But he did not. ,4184,4200
46,"We talked it over in all manner of ways, yet could not agree on the subject. ",4200,4277
47,"However, the wine was excellent, and we clanked our glasses together as we drank. ",4277,4359
48,"There must have been magic in it, or I should most certainly become tipsy. ",4359,4434
49,"But that did not happen, for my mind seemed quite clear. ",4434,4491
50,"Indeed, a kind of sunshine filled the room, and beamed from the eyes of the Polytechnic lecturer. ",4491,4589
51,"It made me think of the old stories when the gods, in their immortal youth, wandered upon this earth, and paid visits to mankind. ",4589,4719
52,"I said so to him, and he smiled. ",4719,4752
53,"I could have sworn that he was one of these ancient deities in disguise, or, at all events, that he belonged to the race of the gods. ",4752,4886
54,The result seemed to prove I was right in my suspicions. ,4886,4943
55,"For it was arranged that my highest wish should be granted, that my puppets were to be gifted with life. ",4943,5048
56,I was to be the manager of a real company. ,5048,5091
57,"We drank to my success, and clanked our glasses. ",5091,5140
58,"Then he packed all my dolls into the box, and fastened it on my back, and I felt as if I were spinning round in a circle. ",5140,5262
59,I presently found myself lying on the floor. ,5262,5307
60,I remember that quite well. ,5307,5335
61,And then the whole company sprang from the box. ,5335,5383
62,The spirit had come upon us all. ,5383,5416
63,"The puppets had become distinguished actors--at least, so they said themselves--and I was their director. ",5416,5522
64,"""When all was ready for the first representation, the whole company requested permission to speak to me before appearing in public. ",5522,5654
65,The dancing lady said the house could not be supported unless she stood on one leg. ,5654,5738
66,"For she was a great genius, and begged to be treated as such. ",5738,5800
67,"The lady who acted the part of the queen expected to be treated as a queen off the stage, as well as on it, or else she said she should get out of practice. ",5800,5957
68,The man whose duty it was to deliver a letter gave himself as many airs as he who took the part of first lover in the piece. ,5957,6082
69,"He declared that the inferior parts were as important as the great ones, and deserving equal consideration, as parts of an artistic whole. ",6082,6221
70,The hero of the piece would only play in a part containing points likely to bring down the applause of the house. ,6221,6335
71,"The 'prima donna' would only act when the lights were red, for she declared that a blue light did not suit her complexion. ",6335,6458
72,"It was like a company of flies in a bottle, and I was in the bottle with them. ",6458,6537
73,I was their director. ,5500,5522
74,"My breath was taken away, my head whirled, and I was as miserable as a man could be. ",6559,6644
75,"It was quite a novel, strange set of beings among whom I now found myself. ",6644,6719
76,"I only wished I had them all in my box again, and that I had never been their director. ",6719,6807
77,"So I told them roundly that, after all, they were nothing but puppets; ",6807,6878
78, and then they killed me. ,6877,6903
79,After a while I found myself lying on my bed in my room; ,6903,6960
80," but how I got there, or how I got away at all from the Polytechnic professor, he may perhaps know, I don't. ",6959,7068
81,"The moon shone upon the floor, the box lay open, and the dolls were all scattered about in great confusion. ",7068,7176
82,But I was not idle. ,7176,7196
83,"I jumped off the bed, and into the box they all had to go, some on their heads, some on their feet. ",7196,7296
84,"Then I shut down the lid, and seated myself upon the box. ",7296,7354
85,"'Now you'll have to stay,' said I, 'and I shall be cautious how I wish you flesh and blood again.' ",7354,7453
86,"""I felt quite light, my cheerfulness had returned, and I was the happiest of mortals. ",7453,7539
87,The Polytechnic professor had fully cured me. ,7539,7585
88,"I was as happy as a king, and went to sleep on the box. ",7585,7641
89,"Next morning--correctly speaking, it was noon, for I slept remarkably late that day--I found myself still sitting there, in happy consciousness that my former wish had been a foolish one. ",7641,7829
90,I inquired for the Polytechnic professor. ,7829,7871
91,But he had disappeared like the Greek and Roman gods. ,7871,7925
92,From that time I have been the happiest man in the world. ,7925,7983
93,I am a happy director; ,7983,8006
94," for none of my company ever grumble, nor the public either, for I always make them merry. ",8005,8096
95,I can arrange my pieces just as I please. ,8096,8138
96,"I choose out of every comedy what I like best, and no one is offended."" ",8138,8210
97,"""Plays that are neglected now-a-days by the great public were ran after thirty years ago, and listened to till the tears ran down the cheeks of the audience. ",8210,8368
98,These are the pieces I bring forward. ,8368,8406
99,"I place them before the little ones, who cry over them as papa and mamma used to cry thirty years ago. ",8406,8509
100,"But I make them shorter, for the youngsters don't like long speeches. ",8509,8579
101,"And if they have anything mournful, they like it to be over quickly.""",8579,8649
