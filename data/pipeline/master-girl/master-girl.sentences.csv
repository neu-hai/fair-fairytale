0,Once upon a time there was a king who had several sons. ,0,56
1,"I do not just know how many there were, but the youngest was not content at home. ",56,138
2,He insisted on going out into the world to seek his fortune. ,138,199
3,And in the end the king had to give him permission to do so. ,199,260
4,"After he had wandered for a few days, he came to a giant's castle, and took service with the giant. ",260,360
5,"In the morning the giant wanted to go off to herd his goats, and when he started he told the king's son he was to clean the stable in the meantime. ",360,508
6,"""And when you are through with that, you need do nothing more for to-day, for you might as well know that you have come to a kind master,"" said he. ",508,656
7,"""But you must do what you are told to do conscientiously and, besides, you must not go into any of the rooms that lie behind the one in which you slept last night, else your life will pay the forfeit."" ",656,858
8,"""He surely is a kind master,"" said the king's son to himself, walked up and down the room, and whistled and sang. ",858,972
9,He thought there would be plenty of time to clean the stable. ,972,1034
10,"""But it would be nice to take a look at the other room, there surely must be something in it that he is alarmed about, since I am not so much as to take a look,"" thought he, and went into the first room. ",1034,1238
11,"There hung a kettle, and it was boiling, but the king's son could find no fire beneath it. ",1238,1329
12,"""What can there be in it?"" ",1329,1356
13,"thought he, and dipped in a lock of his hair, and at once the hair grew just like copper. ",1356,1446
14,"""That's a fine soup, and whoever tastes it will burn his mouth,"" said the youth, and went into the next room. ",1446,1556
15,There hung another kettle that bubbled and boiled. ,1556,1607
16,"But there was no fire beneath it, either. ",1607,1649
17,"""I must try this one, too,"" said the king's son, and again he dipped in a lock of his hair and it grew just like silver. ",1649,1770
18,"""We have no such expensive soup at home,"" said the king's son, ""but the main thing is, how does it taste?"" ",1770,1877
19,and with that he went into the third room. ,1877,1920
20,"And there hung still another kettle, a-boiling just like those in the two other rooms, and the king's son wanted to try this one, too. ",1920,2055
21,"He dipped in a lock of his hair, and it came out like pure gold, and fairly shimmered. ",2055,2142
22,"Then the king's son said: ""Better and better! ",2142,2188
23,"But if he cooks gold here, I wonder what he cooks inside, there?"" ",2188,2254
24,"And he wanted to see, so he went into the fourth room. ",2254,2309
25,Here there was no kettle to be seen. ,2309,2346
26,But a maiden sat on a bench who must have been a king's daughter. ,2346,2412
27,"Yet whatever she might be, the king's son had never seen any one so beautiful in all his days. ",2412,2507
28,"""Now in heaven's name, what are you doing here?"" ",2507,2556
29,asked the maiden. ,2556,2574
30,"""I hired myself out here yesterday,"" said the king's son. ",2574,2632
31,"""May God be your aid, for it is a fine service you have chosen!"" ",2632,2697
32,said she. ,2697,2707
33,"""O, the master is very friendly,"" said the king's son. ",2707,2762
34,"""He has given me no hard work to do to-day. ",2762,2806
35,"When I have cleaned out the stable, I need do nothing more."" ",2806,2867
36,"""Yes, but how are you going to manage it?"" ",2867,2910
37,she went on. ,2910,2923
38,"""If you do as the others have done, then for every shovelful you pitch out, ten fresh shovelfuls will fly in. ",2923,3033
39,But I'll tell you how to go about it. ,3033,3071
40,"You must turn around the shovel, and work with the handle, then everything will fly out by itself."" ",3071,3171
41,"This he would do, said the king's son. ",3171,3210
42,"He sat there with her all day long, for they had soon agreed that they would marry, he and the king's daughter, and in this way his first day in the giant's service did not weary him at all. ",3210,3401
43,"When evening came on, she told him that now he must clean out the stable before the giant came. ",3401,3497
44,"When he got there he thought he would try out her advice, and began to use the shovel as he had seen his father's grooms use it. ",3497,3626
45,"And sure enough, he had to stop quickly. ",3626,3667
46,"After he had worked a little while, he hardly had room in which to stand. ",3667,3741
47,"Then he did as the king's daughter had told him, turned the shovel around and used the handle. ",3741,3836
48,And in a wink the stable was as clean as though it had been scrubbed. ,3836,3906
49,"When he had finished he went to the room that the giant had assigned him, and walked up and down, whistling and singing. ",3906,4027
50,Then the giant came home with his goats. ,4027,4068
51,"""Have you cleaned out the stable?"" ",4068,4103
52,he asked. ,4103,4113
53,"""Yes, indeed, master, it is spick and span,"" said the king's son. ",4113,4179
54,"""I'll have to see that,"" said the giant, and went into the stable. ",4179,4246
55,It was just as the king's son had said. ,4246,4286
56,"""You surely have been talking to the Master Girl, for you could not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ",4286,4393
57,"""Master Girl? ",4393,4407
58,"What is a Master Girl?"" ",4407,4431
59,"said the king's son, and pretended to be very stupid. ",4431,4485
60,"""I'd like to see her, too."" ",4485,4513
61,"""You will see her in plenty of time,"" said the giant. ",4513,4567
62,The next morning the giant went off again with his goats. ,4567,4625
63,"And he told the king's son he was to fetch his horse from the pasture, and when he had done this, he might rest: ""For you have come to a kind master,"" said he. ",4625,4785
64,"""But if you enter one of the rooms which I forbade you entering yesterday, I will tear off your head,"" he said, and went away with his herd. ",4785,4926
65,"""Indeed, you are a kind master,"" said the king's son, ""but in spite of it I'd like to have another little talk with the Master Girl, for she is just as much mine as yours,"" and with that he went in to her. ",4926,5132
66,She asked him what work he had to do that day. ,5132,5179
67,"""O, it is not so bad to-day,"" said the king's son. ",5179,5230
68,"""I am only to fetch his horse from the pasture."" ",5230,5279
69,"""And how are you going to manage that?"" ",5279,5319
70,asked the Master Girl. ,5319,5342
71,"""Surely it is no great feat to fetch a horse from pasture,"" said the king's son, ""and I have ridden swift horses before."" ",5342,5464
72,"""Yet it is not an easy matter to ride this horse home,"" said the Master Girl, ""but I will tell you how to set about it. ",5464,5584
73,"When you see the horse, he will come running up, breathing fire and flame, just as though he were a burning pine-torch. ",5584,5704
74,"Then you must take the bit that is hanging here on the door, and throw it into his mouth. ",5704,5794
75,"Then he will grow so tame that you can do what you will with him."" ",5794,5861
76,"He would take good note of it, said the king's son. ",5861,5913
77,He sat there with the Master Girl the whole day long. ,5913,5967
78,"They chatted and talked about this and that, but mainly about how delightful it would be, and what a pleasant time they could have, if they could only marry and get away from the giant. ",5967,6153
79,"And the king's son would have forgotten the pasture and the horse altogether, had not the Master Girl reminded him of them toward evening. ",6153,6292
80,"He took the bit that hung in the corner, hurried out to the pasture, and the horse at once ran up, breathing fire and flame. ",6292,6417
81,"He seized the moment when he came running up to him with his jaws wide open, and threw the bit into his mouth. ",6417,6528
82,"Then he stood still, as gentle as a young lamb, and he had no trouble bringing him to the stable. ",6528,6626
83,"Then he went to his room again, and began to whistle and sing. ",6626,6689
84,In the evening the giant came home with his goats. ,6689,6740
85,"""Did you fetch the horse?"" ",6740,6767
86,he asked. ,4103,4113
87,"""Yes, master,"" said the king's son. ",6777,6813
88,"""It would make a fine saddle-horse, but I just took it straight to the stable."" ",6813,6893
89,"""I'll have to see that,"" said the giant, and went into the stable. ",4179,4246
90,"But there stood the horse, just as the king's son had said. ",6960,7020
91,"""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl, for you could not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ",7020,7125
92,"""Yesterday the master chattered about the Master Girl, and to-day he is talking about her again. ",7125,7222
93,"I wish master would show me the creature, for I surely would like to see her,"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very simple and stupid. ",7222,7366
94,"""You will get to see her in plenty of time,"" said the giant. ",7366,7427
95,On the third morning the giant went off again with his goats. ,7427,7489
96,"""To-day you must go to the devil, and fetch me his tribute,"" said he to the king's son. ",7489,7577
97,"""When you have done that, you may rest for the remainder of the time, for you have come to a kind master, and you might as well know it,"" and with that he went off. ",7577,7742
98,"""You may be a kind master,"" said the king's son. ",7742,7791
99,"""Yet you hand over some pretty mean jobs to me in spite of it, but I think I'll look after your Master Girl a bit. ",7791,7906
100,"You claim that she belongs to you, but perhaps, in spite of it, she may tell me what to do,"" and with that he went in to her. ",7906,8032
101,"And when the Master Girl asked him what the giant had given him to do that day, he told her he must go to the devil and fetch a tribute. ",8032,8169
102,"""But how will you go about it?"" ",8169,8201
103,asked the Master Girl. ,5319,5342
104,"""You will have to tell me that,"" said the king's son, ""for I have never been to the devil's place. ",8224,8323
105,"Even though I knew the way there, I still would not know how much to ask for."" ",8323,8402
106,"""I will tell you what you must do,"" said the Master Girl. ",8402,8460
107,"""You must go to the rock behind the pasture, and take the club that is lying there, and strike the rock with it. ",8460,8573
108,"Then one will come out whose eyes flash fire, and you must tell him your business. ",8573,8656
109,"And if he asks how much you want, you must tell him as much as you can carry."" ",8656,8735
110,"He would take good note of it, said the king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl all day long until evening. ",8735,8853
111,"He might be sitting there yet, if the Master Girl had not reminded him that he must still go to the devil about the tribute before the giant came home. ",8853,9005
112,"So he set out, and did exactly as the Master Girl had told him: he went to the rock, took the club and beat against it. ",9005,9125
113,Then one came out from whose eyes and nose the sparks flew. ,9125,9185
114,"""What do you want?"" ",9185,9205
115,he asked. ,4103,4113
116,"""The giant has sent me to fetch his tribute,"" said the king's son. ",9215,9282
117,"""How much do you want?"" ",9282,9306
118,the other again inquired. ,9306,9332
119,"""I never ask for more than I can carry,"" was the reply of the king's son. ",9332,9406
120,"""It is lucky for you that you did not ask for a whole ton at once,"" said the one on the hill. ",9406,9500
121,"""But come in with me, and wait a while."" ",9500,9541
122,"This the king's son did, and saw a great deal of gold and silver lying in the hill like dead rock in an ore-pile. ",9541,9655
123,"Then as much as he could carry was packed up, and with it he went his way. ",9655,9730
124,"When the giant came home in the evening with his goats, the king's son was running about the room, whistling and singing as on the two preceding evenings. ",9730,9885
125,"""Did you go to the devil for the tribute?"" ",9885,9928
126,asked the giant. ,9928,9945
127,"""Yes, indeed, master,"" said the king's son. ",9945,9989
128,"""Where did you put it?"" ",9989,10013
129,asked the giant again. ,10013,10036
130,"""I stood the sack of gold outside on the bench,"" was the reply. ",10036,10100
131,"""I must see that at once,"" said the giant, and went over to the bench. ",10100,10171
132,"But the sack was really standing there, and it was so full that the gold and silver rolled right out when the giant loosened the string. ",10171,10308
133,"""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl,"" said the giant. ",10308,10373
134,"""If that is the case I will tear your head off."" ",10373,10422
135,"""With your Master Girl?"" ",10422,10447
136,said the king's son. ,2611,2632
137,"""Yesterday master talked about that Master Girl, and to-day he is talking about her again, and the day before yesterday he talked about her, too! ",10468,10614
138,"I only wish that I might get the chance to see her sometime!"" ",10614,10676
139,said he. ,647,656
140,"""Well, just wait until to-morrow,"" said the giant, ""and then I will lead you to her myself,"" he said. ",10685,10787
141,"""A thousand thanks, master,"" said the king's son, ""but I think you are only joking!"" ",10787,10872
142,The following day the giant took him to the Master Girl. ,10872,10929
143,"""Now you must slaughter him, and cook him in the big kettle, you know which one I mean. ",10929,11017
144,"And when the soup is ready, you can call me,"" said the giant. ",11017,11079
145,"He lay down on the bench to sleep, and at once began to snore so that the hills shook. ",11079,11166
146,"Then the Master Girl took a knife, and cut the youth's little finger, and let three drops of blood fall on the bench. ",11166,11284
147,"Then she took all the old rags, and old shoes and other rubbish she could find, and threw them all into the kettle. ",11284,11400
148,"And then she took a chest of gold-dust, and a lick-stone, and a bottle of water that hung over the door, and a golden apple, and two golden hens. ",11400,11546
149,She left the giant's castle together with the king's son as quickly as possible. ,11546,11627
150,"After a time they came to the sea, and they sailed across. ",11627,11686
151,"Though where they got the ship, I do not exactly know. ",11686,11741
152,"Now when the giant had been sleeping quite a while, he began to stretch himself on his bench. ",11741,11835
153,"""Is dinner ready yet?"" ",11835,11858
154,he asked. ,4103,4113
155,"""Just begun!""",11868,11881
156,"""said the first drop of blood on the bench. ",11880,11924
157,"Then the giant turned around, went to sleep again, and went on sleeping for quite some time. ",11924,12017
158,Then he again turned around a little. ,12017,12055
159,"""Is dinner not ready yet?"" ",12055,12082
160,"he said, but did not open his eyes--nor had he done so the first time--for he was still half asleep. ",12082,12183
161,"""It is half ready!"" ",12183,12203
162,"called out the second drop of blood, and then the giant thought it was the Master Girl. ",12203,12291
163,He turned around on the bench and took another nap. ,12291,12343
164,"After he had slept a couple of hours longer, he once more began to move about and stretch: ""Is dinner still not ready?"" ",12343,12463
165,said he. ,647,656
166,"""Ready!"" ",12472,12481
167,answered the third drop of blood. ,12481,12515
168,The giant sat up and rubbed his eyes. ,12515,12553
169,"But he could not see who had called him, and so he called out to the Master Girl. ",12553,12635
170,But no one answered him. ,12635,12660
171,"""O, I suppose she has gone out for a little,"" thought the giant, and he dipped his spoon in the kettle to try the dinner. ",12660,12782
172,"But there was nothing but leather soles and rags and like rubbish cooked together, and he did not know whether it were mush or porridge. ",12782,12919
173,"When he noticed this he began to see a light, and realize how matters had come to pass. ",12919,13007
174,"He grew so angry that he hardly knew what to do, and made after the king's son and the Master Girl in flying haste. ",13007,13123
175,"In a short time he came to the sea, and could not cross. ",13123,13180
176,"""But I know how to help myself,"" said ahe. ",13180,13223
177,"""I will fetch my sea-sucker."" ",13223,13253
178,"So the sea-sucker came, and lay down and took two or three swallows, and thus lowered the water so that the giant could see the king's son and the Master Girl out on the ship. ",13253,13429
179,"""Now you must throw the lick-stone overboard,"" said the Master Girl, and the king's son did so. ",13429,13525
180,"It turned into a tremendous large rock square across the sea, and the giant could not get over, and the sea-sucker could drink up no more of the sea. ",13525,13675
181,"""I know quite well what I must do,"" said the giant. ",13675,13727
182,"""I must now fetch my hill-borer."" ",13727,13761
183,"So the hill-borer came, and bored a hole through the rock, so the sea-sucker could get through and keep on sucking. ",13761,13877
184,"But no sooner were they thus far than the Master Girl told the king's son to pour a drop or so of the bottle overboard, and the sea grew so full that they had landed before the sea-sucker could so much as take a single swallow. ",13877,14105
185,Now they wanted to go home to the father of the king's son; ,14105,14165
186," but he would not hear of the Master Girl's going afoot, since he did not think this fitting for either of them. ",14164,14277
187,"""Wait here a little while, until I fetch the seven horses that stand in my father's stable,"" said the king's son. ",14277,14391
188,"""It is not far, and I will soon be back; ",14391,14432
189," for I will not have my bride come marching home afoot."" ",14431,14488
190,"""No, do not do so, for when you get home to the castle you will forget me, I know that positively,"" said the Master Girl. ",14488,14610
191,"""How could I forget you?"" ",14610,14636
192,said the king's son. ,2611,2632
193,"""We have passed through so many hardships together, and we love each other so dearly,"" said he. ",14657,14753
194,"He wanted to fetch the coach and seven horses at all costs, and she was to wait by the seashore. ",14753,14850
195,So at last the Master Girl had to give in. ,14850,14893
196,"""But when you get there, you must not take time to greet a single person. ",14893,14967
197,"You must at once go to the stable, harness the horses, and drive back as swiftly as you can. ",14967,15060
198,"They will all come to meet you, but you must act as though you did not see them, and must not take a single bite to eat. ",15060,15181
199,"If you do not do that, you will make both of us unhappy,"" said she. ",15181,15249
200,And he promised to do as she had said. ,15249,15288
201,"But when he got home to the castle, one of his brothers was just getting married, and the bride and all the guests were already there. ",15288,15423
202,"They all crowded around him and asked him this, and asked him that, and wanted to lead him in. ",15423,15518
203,"But he acted as though he saw none of them, led out the horses, and began to put them to the coach. ",15518,15618
204,"And since they could by no manner of means induce him to come into the castle, they came out with food and drink, and offered him the best of all that had been prepared for the wedding feast. ",15618,15810
205,"But the king's son would taste nothing, and only made haste in order to get away. ",15810,15892
206,"Yet, finally, the bride's sister rolled an apple over to him across the court-yard: ""And if you will touch nothing else, then at least you might take a bite of the apple, for you must be hungry and thirsty after your long journey,"" said she, and he took the apple and bit into it. ",15892,16173
207,"But no sooner did he have the bit of apple in his mouth than he had forgotten the Master Girl, and that he was to fetch her. ",16173,16298
208,"""I think I must be going mad! ",16298,16328
209,"What am I doing with the horses and the coach?"" ",16328,16376
210,"he said, and he led back the horses into the stable, and went back to the castle, and wanted to marry the bride's sister, the one who had thrown him the apple. ",16376,16536
211,"In the meantime the Master Girl sat by the seashore, and waited and waited; ",16536,16612
212, but no king's son came. ,16611,16636
213,"Then she went on, and after she had gone a while, she came to a little hut that lay all by itself in the forest, near the king's castle. ",16636,16773
214,She went in and asked whether she might not stay there. ,16773,16829
215,"Now the little hut belonged to an old woman, and she was an arrant and evil witch; ",16829,16912
216, at first she did not want to take in the Master Girl at all; ,16911,16973
217, but at last she agreed to do so for love of money. ,16972,17024
218,But the whole hut was as dark and dirty as a pig-sty; ,17024,17078
219," therefore the Master Girl said she would clean up a bit, so that things would look as they did in other, decent people's houses. ",17077,17207
220,"The old woman would have none of it, and was very disagreeable and angry; ",17207,17281
221, but the Master Girl paid no attention to her. ,17280,17327
222,"She took the chest of gold dust, and threw a handful into the fire, so that a ray of gold shone over the whole hut, and it was gilded outside and in. ",17327,17477
223,"But when the gold flamed up, the old woman was so terribly frightened that she ran out as though the evil one were after her, and from pure rage she forgot to duck at the threshold, and ran her head against the door-post. ",17477,17699
224,And that was the end of her. ,17699,17728
225,The following morning the bailiff came by. ,17728,17771
226,"He was much surprised to see the little golden hut, glittering and sparkling there in the forest, and was still more surprised at the girl within the hut. ",17771,17926
227,"He fell in love with her at once, and asked her whether she would not become the bailiff's lady. ",17926,18023
228,"""Yes, but have you plenty of money?"" ",18023,18060
229,said the Master Girl. ,8438,8460
230,"Yes, he had quite a little, said the bailiff. ",18082,18128
231,"Then he went home to fetch his money, and came back again at evening dragging along an enormous sack of it, which he stood on a bench before the door. ",18128,18279
232,"The Master Girl said that, seeing he had so much money, she would accept him. ",18279,18357
233,"And then she asked him to rake the fire, which she said she had forgotten to do. ",18357,18438
234,"But as soon as he had the poker in his hand, the Master Girl cried: ""May God grant that you hold the poker, and the poker hold you, and that sparks and ashes fly around you until morning!"" ",18438,18627
235,"And there the bailiff stood the whole night through, and sparks and ashes flew about him, nor were the sparks the less hot for all his complaining and begging. ",18627,18787
236,"And when morning came, and he could let go the poker, he did not stay long; ",18787,18863
237, but ran off as though the evil one were at his heels. ,18862,18917
238,"And those who saw him stared and laughed, for he ran like a madman, and looked as though he had been thrashed and tanned. ",18917,19039
239,"And all would have liked to have known where he had come from, but he said not a word, for he was ashamed. ",19039,19146
240,On the following day the clerk passed by the Master Girl's little house. ,19146,19219
241,"He saw it glistening and shining in the woods, and went in to find out who lived there. ",19219,19307
242,"When he saw the beautiful girl he fell even more deeply in love with her than the bailiff had, and lost no time in suing for her hand. ",19307,19442
243,"The Master Girl asked him, as she had asked the bailiff, whether he had plenty of money. ",19442,19531
244,"Money he had to spare, answered the clerk, and ran right home to fetch it. ",19531,19606
245,By evening he was back again with a great sack--it must have been as much again as the bailiff had brought--and stood it on the bench. ,19606,19741
246,And so she promised to take him. ,19741,19774
247,"Then she asked him to shut the house-door, which she said she had forgotten to do. ",19774,19857
248,"But when he had the door-knob in his hand, she cried: ""May God grant that you hold the door-knob and that the door-knob hold you, and that you move back and forth with it all night long until morning!"" ",19857,20059
249,"And the clerk had to dance the whole night through, such a waltz as he had never tripped before, and he had no wish to repeat the experience. ",20059,20201
250,"Sometimes he was ahead, and sometimes the door was, and so they went back and forth all night, from wall to post and post to wall, and he was nearly bruised to death. ",20201,20368
251,"First he cursed, then he wailed and pleaded; ",20368,20413
252," but the door paid no attention to him, and flung open and shut until it dawned. ",20412,20493
253,"When it at last released him, he hurried away as quickly as though he had stolen something, forgot his sackful of money, and his wish to marry, and was glad that the door did not come threshing along after him. ",20493,20704
254,"All grinned and stared at the clerk, for he ran like a madman, and looked worse than if a ram had been butting him all night long. ",20704,20835
255,"On the third day the magistrate came by, and also saw the little golden house in the forest. ",20835,20928
256,"And he, too, went in to see who lived in it. ",20928,20973
257,"And when he saw the Master Girl, he fell so deeply in love with her that he sued for her hand as soon as he bade her good-day. ",20973,21100
258,"But she told him just what she had told the others, that if he had plenty of money she would take him. ",21100,21203
259,"He had money enough, said the magistrate, and he went straight home to fetch it. ",21203,21284
260,"When he came back in the evening, he had a much bigger sack of money with him than the clerk had had, and he stood it on the bench. ",21284,21416
261,Then the Master Girl said she would take him. ,21416,21462
262,"But first she asked him to go fetch the calf, which she had forgotten to bring to the stable. ",21462,21556
263,"And when he had the calf by the tail she cried: ""May God grant that you hold the calf's tail, and the calf's tail hold you, and that you fly about the world together until morning!"" ",21556,21738
264,"And with that the race began, over stick and stone, over hill and dale, and the more the magistrate cursed and yelled, the more madly the calf ran away. ",21738,21891
265,"When it dawned there was hardly a whole bone in the magistrate's body, and he was so happy to be able to let go the calf's tail that he forgot his bag of money, and the whole occurrence. ",21891,22078
266,It is true that he went home more slowly than the bailiff and the clerk; ,22078,22151
267," but the slower he went the more time the people had to stare and grin at him, so ragged and badly beaten did he appear after his dance with the calf. ",22150,22301
268,"On the following day there was to be a wedding at the castle, and not only was the older prince to marry, but the one who had stayed with the giant as well, and he was to get the other bride's sister. ",22301,22502
269,"But when they entered the coach and were about to drive to church, one of the axles broke. ",22502,22593
270,"They took another, and then a third, but all of them broke, no matter what kind of wood they used. ",22593,22692
271,"It took a great deal of time, and they did not move from the spot, and got all out of sorts. ",22692,22785
272,"Then the bailiff said, for he had also been invited to the wedding at the castle, that a maiden lived out in the forest, and ""if they could only get the loan of her poker, it would be sure to hold."" ",22785,22984
273,"So they sent to the little house in the forest, and asked most politely whether the maiden would not loan them the poker of which the bailiff had spoken. ",22984,23138
274,"And they got it, too, and then they had an axle that would not break. ",23138,23208
275,"But when they wanted to drive on, the bottom of the coach broke. ",23208,23273
276,"They made a new bottom as well as they were able, but no matter how they put it together, nor what kind of wood they used, it kept on breaking again as soon as they had left the court-yard. ",23273,23463
277,And they were worse off than they had been with the axle. ,23463,23521
278,"Then the clerk said--for if the bailiff was one of the company, you may be sure they had not forgotten to invite the clerk--""Out in the forest lives a maiden, and if you will get the loan of her house-door, I am sure it would not break."" ",23521,23759
279,"So they sent to the little house in the forest, and asked most politely whether the maiden would not loan them the golden house-door, of which the clerk had told them. ",23759,23927
280,"And they got it, too, and were about to drive on, when suddenly the horses could not draw the coach. ",23927,24028
281,"There were six, so they put to eight, and then ten and twelve, but though they put as many as they liked to the coach and helped along with the whip, still the coach would not budge. ",24028,24211
282,"The day was already far advanced, and they simply had to get to church, and actually began to despair. ",24211,24314
283,"But then the magistrate said that out in the golden house in the forest lived a maiden, ""and if one could only get the loan of her calf, it would be sure to pull the coach, and though it were as heavy as a bowlder."" ",24314,24530
284,They did not think it quite the thing to drive to church with a calf; ,24530,24600
285," but still there was nothing to do but to send to the maiden, and to ask her most politely, with a kind greeting from the king, if she would loan them the calf of which the magistrate had spoken. ",24599,24795
286,Nor did the Master Girl refuse them this time. ,24795,24842
287,"And then, when they had put the calf to the coach, it moved from the spot quickly enough. ",24842,24932
288,"It flew over stick and stone, hill and dale, so that the people inside could hardly catch their breath. ",24932,25036
289,"First it was on the ground, and next it was in the air, and when they reached the church, it spun around it like a top, and they had the greatest difficulty in getting out and into the church. ",25036,25229
290,"And going home they went still faster, and were nearly out of their wits by the time they reached the castle. ",25229,25339
291,"When they sat down to the table the king's son--the same who had been at the giant's--said it would be no more than right to invite the maiden, too, who had lent them the poker, and the door and the calf: ""for if we had not had these things, we should not have moved from the spot."" ",25339,25622
292,"This seemed right to the king, so he sent five of his most distinguished courtiers to the little golden house. ",25622,25733
293,"They were to carry the king's kindest greetings, and ask that the maiden come up to the castle and take dinner with them. ",25733,25855
294,"""A kind greeting to the king, and if he is too good to come to me, then I am too good to go to him,"" said the Master Girl. ",25855,25978
295,"So the king had to go to her himself, and then she went along with him at once, and the king saw very well that she was more than she appeared to be, and gave her a place at the head of the table, next to the young bridegroom. ",25978,26205
296,"After they had been at dinner for a while, the Master Girl produced the rooster and the hen and the golden apple--they were the three things she had taken along from the giant's castle--and placed them on the table before her. ",26205,26432
297,At once the rooster and the hen began to fight for the golden apple. ,26432,26501
298,"""Why, just see how the two fight for the golden apple!"" ",26501,26557
299,said the king's son. ,2611,2632
300,"""Yes, that is how we had to fight the time we wanted to get out of the rock!"" ",26578,26656
301,said the Master Girl. ,8438,8460
302,"And then the king's son recognized her, and was very happy. ",26678,26738
303,The witch who had rolled the apple over to him was duly punished. ,26738,26804
304,"Then the wedding really began, and the bailiff, and the clerk and the magistrate held out to the very end, for all that their wings had been so thoroughly singed.",26804,26967
