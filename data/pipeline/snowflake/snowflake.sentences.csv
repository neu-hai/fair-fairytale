0,"Once upon a time there lived a peasant called Ivan, and he had a wife whose name was Marie. ",0,92
1,"They would have been quite happy except for one thing: they had no children to play with, and as they were now old people they did not find that watching the children of their neighbours at all made up to them for having one of their own. ",92,331
2,"One winter, which nobody living will ever forget, the snow lay so deep that it came up to the knees of even the tallest man. ",331,456
3,"When it had all fallen, and the sun was shining again, the children ran out into the street to play, and the old man and his wife sat at their window and gazed at them. ",456,625
4,"The children first made a sort of little terrace, and stamped it hard and firm, and then they began to make a snow woman. ",625,747
5,"Ivan and Marie watched them, the while thinking about many things. ",747,814
6,"Suddenly Ivan's face brightened, and, looking at his wife, he said, 'Wife, why shouldn't we make a snow woman too?' ",814,930
7,'Why not?' ,930,941
8,"replied Marie, who happened to be in a very good temper; ",941,998
9, 'it might amuse us a little. ,997,1027
10,But there is no use making a woman. ,1027,1063
11,"Let us make a little snow child, and pretend it is a living one.' ",1063,1129
12,"'Yes, let us do that,' said Ivan, and he took down his cap and went into the garden with his old wife. ",1129,1232
13,Then the two set to work with all their might to make a doll out of the snow. ,1232,1310
14,They shaped a little body and two little hands and two little feet. ,1310,1378
15,"On top of all they placed a ball of snow, out of which the head was to be. ",1378,1453
16,'What in the world are you doing?' ,1453,1488
17,asked a passer-by. ,1488,1507
18,'Can't you guess?' ,1507,1526
19,returned Ivan. ,1526,1541
20,"'Making a snow-child,' replied Marie. ",1541,1579
21,They had finished the nose and the chin. ,1579,1620
22,"Two holes were left for the eyes, and Ivan carefully shaped out the mouth. ",1620,1695
23,No sooner had he done so than he felt a warm breath upon his cheek. ,1695,1763
24,He started back in surprise and looked-and behold! ,1763,1814
25,"the eyes of the child met his, and its lips, which were as red as raspberries, smiled at him! ",1814,1908
26,'What is it?' ,1908,1922
27,"cried Ivan, crossing himself. ",1922,1952
28,"'Am I mad, or is the thing bewitched?' ",1952,1991
29,The snow-child bent its head as if it had been really alive. ,1991,2052
30,It moved its little arms and its little legs in the snow that lay about it just as the living children did theirs. ,2052,2167
31,'Ah! ,2167,2172
32,"Ivan, Ivan,' exclaimed Marie, trembling with joy, 'heaven has sent us a child at last!' ",2172,2260
33,And she threw herself upon Snowflake (for that was the snow-child's name) and covered her with kisses. ,2260,2363
34,"And the loose snow fell away from Snowflake as an egg shell does from an egg, and it was a little girl whom Marie held in her arms. ",2363,2495
35,'Oh! ,2495,2500
36,my darling Snowflake!' ,2500,2523
37,"cried the old woman, and led her into the cottage. ",2523,2574
38,And Snowflake grew fast; ,2574,2599
39," each hour as well as each day made a difference, and every day she became more and more beautiful. ",2598,2698
40,"The old couple hardly knew how to contain themselves for joy, and thought of nothing else. ",2698,2789
41,"The cottage was always full of village children, for they amused Snowflake, and there was nothing in the world they would not have done to amuse her. ",2789,2939
42,"She was their doll, and they were continually inventing new dresses for her, and teaching her songs or playing with her. ",2939,3060
43,Nobody knew how clever she was! ,3060,3092
44,"She noticed everything, and could learn a lesson in a moment. ",3092,3154
45,Anyone would have taken her for thirteen at least! ,3154,3205
46,"And, besides all that, she was so good and obedient; ",3205,3258
47," and so pretty, too! ",3257,3278
48,"Her skin was as white as snow, her eyes as blue as forget-me-nots, and her hair was long and golden. ",3278,3379
49,"Only her cheeks had no colour in them, but were as fair as her forehead. ",3379,3452
50,"So the winter went on, till at last the spring sun mounted higher in the heavens and began to warm the earth. ",3452,3562
51,"The grass grew green in the fields, and high in the air the larks were heard singing. ",3562,3648
52,"The village girls met and danced in a ring, singing, 'Beautiful spring, how came you here? ",3648,3739
53,How came you here? ,3739,3758
54,"Did you come on a plough, or was it a harrow?' ",3758,3805
55,Only Snowflake sat quite still by the window of the cottage. ,3805,3866
56,"'What is the matter, dear child?' ",3866,3900
57,asked Marie. ,3900,3913
58,'Why are you so sad? ,3913,3934
59,Are you ill? ,3934,3947
60,or have they treated you unkindly?' ,3947,3983
61,"'No,' replied Snowflake, 'it is nothing, mother; ",3983,4032
62, no one has hurt me; ,4031,4052
63, I am well.' ,4051,4064
64,The spring sun had chased away the last snow from its hiding place under the hedges; ,4064,4149
65, the fields were full of flowers; ,4148,4182
66," nightingales sang in the trees, and all the world was gay. ",4181,4241
67,But the gayer grew the birds and the flowers the sadder became Snowflake. ,4241,4315
68,"She hid herself from her playmates, and curled herself up where the shadows were deepest, like a lily amongst its leaves. ",4315,4437
69,Her only pleasure was to lie amid the green willows near some sparkling stream. ,4437,4517
70,At the dawn and at twilight only she seemed happy. ,4517,4568
71,"When a great storm broke, and the earth was white with hail, she became bright and joyous as the Snowflake of old; ",4568,4683
72," but when the clouds passed, and the hail melted beneath the sun, Snowflake would burst into tears and weep as a sister would weep over her brother. ",4682,4831
73,"The spring passed, and it was the eve of St. John, or Midsummer Day. ",4831,4900
74,"This was the greatest holiday of the year, when the young girls met in the woods to dance and play. ",4900,5000
75,"They went to fetch Snowflake, and said to Marie: 'Let her come and dance with us.' ",5000,5083
76,But Marie was afraid; ,5083,5105
77," she could not tell why, only she could not bear the child to go. ",5104,5170
78,"Snowflake did not wish to go either, but they had no excuse ready. ",5170,5237
79,"So Marie kissed the girl and said: 'Go, my Snowflake, and be happy with your friends, and you, dear children, be careful of her. ",5237,5366
80,You know she is the light of my eyes to me.' ,5366,5411
81,"'Oh, we will take care of her,' cried the girls gaily, and they ran off to the woods. ",5411,5497
82,"There they wore wreaths, gathered nosegays, and sang songs some sad, some merry. ",5497,5578
83,And whatever they did Snowflake did too. ,5578,5619
84,"When the sun set they lit a fire of dry grass, and placed themselves in a row, Snowflake being the last of all. ",5619,5731
85,"'Now, watch us,' they said, 'and run just as we do.' ",5731,5784
86,And they all began to sing and to jump one after another across the fire. ,5784,5858
87,"Suddenly, close behind them, they heard a sigh, then a groan. ",5858,5920
88,'Ah!' ,5920,5926
89,They turned hastily and looked at each other. ,5926,5972
90,There was nothing. ,5972,5991
91,They looked again. ,5991,6010
92,Where was Snowflake? ,6010,6031
93,"She has hidden herself for fun, they thought, and searched for her everywhere. ",6031,6110
94,'Snowflake! ,6110,6122
95,Snowflake!' ,2511,2523
96,But there was no answer. ,6134,6159
97,'Where can she be? ,6159,6178
98,"Oh, she must have gone home.' ",6178,6208
99,"They returned to the village, but there was no Snowflake. ",6208,6266
100,For days after that they sought her high and low. ,6266,6316
101,"They examined every bush and every hedge, but there was no Snowflake. ",6316,6386
102,"And long after everyone else had given up hope Ivan and Marie would wander through the woods crying 'Snowflake, my dove, come back, come back!' ",6386,6530
103,"And sometimes they thought they heard a call, but it was never the voice of Snowflake. ",6530,6617
104,And what had become of her? ,6617,6645
105,Had a fierce wild beast seized her and dragged her into his lair in the forest? ,6645,6725
106,Had some bird carried her off across the wide blue sea? ,6725,6781
107,"No, no beast had touched her, no bird had borne her away. ",6781,6839
108,"With the first breath of flame that swept over her when she ran with her friends Snowflake had melted away, and a little soft haze floating upwards was all that remained of her.",6839,7017
