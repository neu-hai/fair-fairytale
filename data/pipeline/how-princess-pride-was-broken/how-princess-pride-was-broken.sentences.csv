0,"There was a princess who was as pretty as a picture, and she was so proud of that that she would not so much as look at a body; ",0,128
1," all the same, there was no lack of lads who came a-wooing, and who would have liked nothing so much as to have had her for a sweetheart because she was so good-looking. ",127,297
2,"But, no, she would have nothing to do with any of them; ",297,353
3, this one was too young and that one was too old; ,352,402
4, this one was too lean and that one was too fat; ,401,450
5, this one was too little and that one was too big; ,449,500
6, this one was too dark and that one was too fair. ,499,549
7,"So there was never a white sheep in the whole flock, as one might say. ",549,620
8,"Now there was one came who was a king in his own country, and a fine one at that. ",620,702
9,The only blemish about him was a mole on his chin; ,702,753
10, apart from that he was as fresh as milk and rose leaves. ,752,810
11,But when the princess saw him she burst out laughing; ,810,864
12," ""Who would choose a specked apple from the basket?"" ",863,916
13,said she; ,916,926
14," and that was all the cake the prince bought at that shop, for off he was packed. ",925,1007
15,"But he was not for giving up, not he; ",1007,1045
16, he went and dressed himself up in rags and tatters; ,1044,1097
17," then back he came again, and not a soul knew him. ",1096,1147
18,Rap! ,1147,1152
19,tap! ,1152,1157
20,"rap!-he knocked at the door, and did they want a stout lad about the place? ",1157,1233
21,"Well, yes; ",1233,1244
22," they were wanting a gooseherd, and if he liked the place he might have it. ",1243,1319
23,"Oh, that fitted his wants like a silk stocking, and the next day he drove the geese up on the hill back of the king's house, so that they might eat grass where it was fresh and green. ",1319,1503
24,"By and by he took a golden ball out of his pocket and began tossing it up and catching it, and as he played with it the sun shone on it so that it dazzled one's eyes to look at it. ",1503,1684
25,"The princess sat at her window, and it was not long before she saw it, I can tell you. ",1684,1771
26,"Dear, dear, but it was a pretty one, the golden ball. ",1771,1825
27,"The princess would like to have such a plaything, that she would; ",1825,1891
28, so she sent one of the maids out to ask whether the gooseherd had a mind to sell it. ,1890,1976
29,"Oh, yes, it was for sale, and cheap at that; ",1976,2021
30, the princess should have it for the kerchief which she wore about her neck. ,2020,2097
31,Prut! ,2097,2103
32,but the lad was a saucy one; ,2103,2132
33, that was what the princess said. ,2131,2165
34,"But, after all, a kerchief was only a kerchief; ",2165,2213
35," fetch the gooseherd over and she would give it to him, for she wanted the pretty golden ball for her own, and she would have it if it were to be had. ",2212,2363
36,"But, no; ",2363,2372
37, the gooseherd would not come at the princess's bidding. ,2371,2428
38,"If she wanted to buy the golden ball she must come up on the hill and pay him, for he was not going to leave his flock of geese, and have them waddling into the garden perhaps; ",2428,2605
39, that is what the gooseherd said. ,2604,2638
40,"So the upshot of the matter was that the princess went out with her women, and gave the lad the kerchief up on the hill behind the hedge, and brought back the golden ball with her for her own. ",2638,2831
41,As for the gooseherd he just tied the kerchief around his arm so that everybody might see it; ,2831,2925
42," and all the folks said, ""Hi! ",2924,2954
43,"that is the princess's kerchief."" ",2954,2988
44,"The next day, when he drove his flock of geese up on the hill, he took a silver looking-glass and a golden comb out of his pocket and began to comb his hair, and you should have seen how the one and the other glistened in the sun. ",2988,3219
45,"It took the princess no longer to see the comb and the looking-glass than it had the golden ball, and then she must and would have them. ",3219,3356
46,"So she sent one to find whether the lad was of a mind to sell them, for she thought that she had never seen anything so pretty in all of her life before. ",3356,3510
47,"""Yes,"" said he, ""I will sell them, but the princess must come up on the hill back of the hedge and give me the necklace she wears about her neck."" ",3510,3657
48,"The princess made a sour enough face at this, but, as the gooseherd would take nothing more nor less than what he had said, she and her maids had to tuck up their dresses and go up on the hill; ",3657,3851
49," there she paid him his price, and brought home the silver looking-glass and the golden comb. ",3850,3944
50,"The lad clasped the necklace about his throat, and, dear, dear, how all the folks did goggle and stare. ",3944,4048
51,"""See,"" said they, ""the princess has been giving the gooseherd the necklace from about her own throat."" ",4048,4151
52,"The third day it was a new thing the gooseherd had, for he brought out a musical box with figures on it, dressed up, and looking for all the world like real little men and women. ",4151,4330
53,"He turned the handle, and when the music played it was sweeter than drops of honey. ",4330,4414
54,"And all the while the little men and women bowed to one another and went through with a dance, for all the world as though they knew what they were about, and were doing it with their own wits. ",4414,4608
55,Good gracious! ,4608,4623
56,how the princess did wonder at the pretty musical box! ,4623,4678
57,She must and would have it at any price; ,4678,4719
58," but this time it was five-and-twenty kisses that the lad was wanting for his musical box, and he would take nothing more nor less than just that much for it. ",4718,4877
59,"Moreover, she would have to come up on the hillside and give them to him, for he could not leave his geese even for five-and-twenty kisses. ",4877,5017
60,But you should have seen what a stew the princess was in at this! ,5017,5083
61,"Five-and-twenty kisses, indeed! ",5083,5115
62,And did the fellow think that it was for the likes of her to be kissing a poor gooseherd? ,5115,5205
63,He might keep his musical box if that was the price he asked for it; ,5205,5274
64, that was what she said. ,5273,5298
65,"As for the lad, he just played the music and played the music, and the more the princess heard and saw the more she wanted it. ",5298,5425
66,"""After all,"" said she, at last, ""a kiss is only a kiss, and I will be none the poorer for giving one or two of them; ",5425,5542
67," I'll just let him have them, since he will take nothing else."" ",5541,5605
68,"So off she marched, with all of her maidens, to pay the gooseherd his price, though it was a sour face she made of it, and that is the truth. ",5605,5747
69,"Now, somebody had been buzzing in the king's ear, and had told him that the gooseherd over yonder was wearing the princess's kerchief and her golden necklace, and folks said she had given them to him of her own free will. ",5747,5969
70,"""What!"" ",5969,5977
71,"says the king, ""is that so? ",5977,6005
72,her kerchief! ,6005,6019
73,golden necklace! ,6019,6036
74,"we will have to look into this business."" ",6036,6078
75,"So off he marched, with his little dog at his heels, to find out what he could about it. ",6078,6167
76,Up the hill he went to where the gooseherd watched his flock; ,6167,6229
77," and when he came near the hedge where the kissing was going on, he heard them counting-""Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three-"" and he wondered what in the world they were all about. ",6228,6411
78,"So he just peeped over the bushes, and there he saw the whole business. ",6411,6483
79,Mercy on us! ,6483,6496
80,what a rage he was in! ,6496,6519
81,So; ,6519,6523
82," the princess would turn up her nose at folks as good as herself, would she? ",6522,6599
83,And here she was kissing the gooseherd back of the hedge. ,6599,6657
84,If he was the kind she liked she should have him for good and all. ,6657,6724
85,"So the minister was called in, and the princess and the gooseherd were married then and there, and that was the end of the business. ",6724,6857
86,"Then off they were packed to shift for themselves in the wide world, for they were not to live at the king's castle, and that was the long and the short of it. ",6857,7017
87,"But the lad did nothing but grumble and growl, and seemed as sore over his bargain as though he had been trying to trick a Jew. ",7017,7145
88,What did he want with a lass for a wife who could neither brew nor bake nor boil blue beans? ,7145,7238
89,That is what he said. ,7238,7260
90,"All the same, they were hitched to the same plough, and there was nothing for it but to pull together the best they could. ",7260,7383
91,"So off they packed, and the poor princess trudged after him and carried his bundle. ",7383,7467
92,"So they went on until they came to a poor, mean little hut. ",7467,7527
93,There she had to take off her fine clothes and put on rags and tatters; ,7527,7599
94, and that was the way she came home. ,7598,7635
95,"""Well,"" said the gooseherd one day, ""it's not the good end of the bargain that I have had in marrying; ",7635,7738
96," all the same, one must make the best one can of a crooked stick when there is none other to be cut in the hedge. ",7737,7851
97,It is little or nothing you are fit for; ,7851,7892
98," but here is a basket of eggs, and you shall take them to the market and sell them."" ",7891,7976
99,"So off the poor princess went to the great town, and stood in the corner of the market with her eggs. ",7976,8078
100,By and by there came along a tipsy countryman-tramp! ,8078,8131
101,tramp! ,8124,8131
102,tramp! ,8124,8131
103,"As for the basket of eggs, he minded them no more than so many green apples. ",8145,8222
104,Smash! ,8222,8229
105,"and there they lay on the ground, and were fit for nothing but to patch broken promises, as we say in our town. ",8229,8341
106,"Then how the poor princess did wring her hands and cry and cry, for she was afraid to go home to her husband, because of the hard words he would be sure to fling at her. ",8341,8511
107,"All the same, there was no other place for her to go; ",8511,8565
108, so back she went. ,8564,8583
109,"""There!"" ",8583,8592
110,"said he, ""I always knew that you were good for nothing but to look at, and now I am more sure of it than ever. ",8592,8703
111,"The china pitcher was never fit to send to the well, and it was a rainy day for me when I married such a left-handed wife;""",8703,8826
112,""" that was what the gooseherd said. ",8825,8861
113,"All the same, the princess should try again; ",8861,8906
114, this time she should take a basket of apples to the market to sell; ,8905,8974
115, for whatever happened she could not break them; ,8973,9022
116, so off she went again. ,9021,9045
117,"Well, by and by came a fellow driving swine, and there sat the princess in the way; ",9045,9129
118," that was bad luck for her, for over tumbled the basket, and the apples went rolling all about the street. ",9128,9235
119,"When the drove had passed there was not a single apple to be seen, for the pigs had eaten every one of them. ",9235,9344
120,"So there was nothing for the princess but to go home crying, with her apron to her eyes. ",9344,9433
121,"""Yes, yes,"" said the gooseherd, ""it is as plain as reading and writing and the nose on your face that you are just fit for nothing at all! ",9433,9572
122,"All the same, we'll make one more try to mend the crack in your luck. ",9572,9642
123,The king up in the castle yonder is married and is going to give a grand feast. ,9642,9722
124,They are wanting a body in the kitchen to draw the water and chop the wood; ,9722,9798
125, and you shall go and try your hand at that; ,9797,9842
126," and see, here is a basket; ",9841,9869
127," you shall take it along and bring home the kitchen scrapings for supper."" ",9868,9943
128,"So off went the princess to the castle kitchen, and there she drew the water and chopped the wood for the cook. ",9943,10055
129,"After her work was done she begged so prettily for the kitchen scrapings that the cook filled her basket full of the leavings from the pots and the pans, for they were about having a grand dinner up-stairs and the king was going to bring home his wife that day. ",10055,10317
130,"By and by it was time for her to be going home, so she picked up her basket and off she went. ",10317,10411
131,Just outside stood two tall soldiers. ,10411,10449
132,"""Halt!"" ",10449,10457
133,said they. ,10457,10468
134,And was she the lass who had been chopping the wood and drawing the water for the cook that day? ,10468,10565
135,Yes? ,10565,10570
136,"Then she must go along with them, for she was wanted up-stairs. ",10570,10634
137,No; ,10634,10638
138," it did no good for her to beg and to pray and to cry and to wring her hands, and it mattered nothing if her good man was waiting for her at home. ",10637,10784
139,"She had been sent for, and she must go, willy-nilly. ",10784,10837
140,"So she had only just time to fling her apron over her basket of kitchen scrapings, and off they marched her. ",10837,10946
141,"There sat the king on his golden throne, dressed all in splendid golden robes, and with a golden crown glittering upon his head. ",10946,11075
142,"But the poor princess was so frightened that she neither looked at anything nor saw anything, but only stood there trembling. ",11075,11201
143,"""What have you under your apron?"" ",11201,11235
144,said the king. ,11235,11250
145,But to this the princess could not answer a single word. ,11250,11307
146,"Then somebody who stood near snatched away her apron, and there was the basket full of kitchen scrapings, and all the time the princess stood so heart-struck with shame that she saw nothing but the cracks in the floor. ",11307,11526
147,"But the king stepped down from his golden throne, dressed all in his golden robes, just as he was, and took the princess by the hand. ",11526,11660
148,"""And do you not know me?"" ",11660,11686
149,said he; ,11686,11695
150," ""look! ",11694,11702
151,"I am the gooseherd."" ",11702,11723
152,And so he was! ,11723,11738
153,"She could see it easily enough now, but that made her more ashamed than ever. ",11738,11816
154,And listen: the king had more to tell her yet. ,11816,11863
155,"He was the tipsy countryman and had knocked over her basket of eggs himself, and more than that he was the swineherd who had driven his pigs over her basket of apples so that they were spilled on the ground. ",11863,12071
156,"But the princess only bowed her head lower and lower, for her pride was broken. ",12071,12151
157,"""Come,"" says the king, ""you are my own sweetheart now;""",12151,12206
158,""" and he kissed her on the cheek and seated her beside himself, and if the princess cried any more the king wiped away her tears with his own pocket-handkerchief. ",12205,12368
159,"As for the poor and rough clothes in which she was dressed, he thought nothing of them, for they were nothing to him. ",12368,12486
160,"That is the end of this story, for everything ends aright in a story worth the telling. ",12486,12574
161,"But if the princess was proud and haughty before, she never was again; ",12574,12645
162," and that is the plain truth, fresh from the churn and no hairs in it, and a lump of it is worth spreading your bread with, I can tell you.",12644,12784
