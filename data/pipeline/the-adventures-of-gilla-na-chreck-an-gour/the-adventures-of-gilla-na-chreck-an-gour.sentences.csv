0,"Long ago a poor widow woman lived down by the iron forge near Enniscorthy, and she was so poor, she had no clothes to put on her son. ",0,134
1,"So, she used to fix him in the ash-hole, near the fire, and pile the warm ashes about him. ",134,225
2,"Accordingly, as he grew up, she sunk the pit deeper. ",225,278
3,"At last, by hook or by crook, she got a goat-skin, and fastened it round his waist, and he felt quite grand, and took a walk down the street. ",278,420
4,"So says she to him next morning, ""Tom, you thief, you never done any good yet, and six-foot high, and past nineteen. ",420,537
5,"Take that rope and bring me a bresna from the wood."" ",537,590
6,"""Never say't twice, mother,"" says Tom; ",590,629
7," ""here goes."" ",628,642
8,"When he had it gathered and tied, what should come up but a big joiant, nine-foot high, and made a lick of a club at him. ",642,764
9,"Well become Tom, he jumped a-one side and picked up a ram-pike. ",764,828
10,The first crack he gave the big fellow he made him kiss the clod. ,828,894
11,"""If you have e'er a prayer,"" says Tom, ""now's the time to say it, before I make brishe of you."" ",894,990
12,"""I have no prayers,"" says the giant, ""but if you spare my life I'll give you that club. ",990,1078
13,"As long as you keep from sin you'll win every battle you ever fight with it."" ",1078,1156
14,Tom made no bones about letting him off. ,1156,1197
15,"As soon as he got the club in his hands he sat down on the bresna and gave it a tap with the kippeen, and says, ""Bresna, I had a great trouble gathering you, and run the risk of my life for you. ",1197,1392
16,"The least you can do is to carry me home."" ",1392,1435
17,"And, sure enough, the wind of the word was all it wanted. ",1435,1493
18,"It went off through the wood, groaning and cracking till it came to the widow's door. ",1493,1579
19,"Well, when the sticks were all burned Tom was sent off again to pick more. ",1579,1654
20,This time he had to fight with a giant with two heads on him. ,1654,1716
21,Tom had a little more trouble with him--that's all. ,1716,1768
22,The prayers he said was to give Tom a fife that nobody could help dancing when he was playing it. ,1768,1866
23,"Begonies, he made the big faggot dance home, with himself sitting on it. ",1866,1939
24,"Well, if you were to count all the steps from this to Dublin, dickens a bit you'd ever arrive there. ",1939,2040
25,The next giant was a beautiful boy with three heads on him. ,2040,2100
26,He had neither prayers nor catechism no more nor the others. ,2100,2161
27,"So he gave Tom a bottle of green ointment that wouldn't let you be burned, nor scalded, nor wounded. ",2161,2262
28,"""And now,"" says he, ""there's no more of us. ",2262,2306
29,"You may come and gather sticks here till little Lunacy Day in harvest without giant or fairy man to disturb you."" ",2306,2420
30,"Well, now, Tom was prouder nor ten paycocks, and used to take a walk down street in the heel of the evening. ",2420,2529
31,"Some of the little boys had no more manners nor if they were Dublin jackeens, and put out their tongues at Tom's club and Tom's goat-skin. ",2529,2668
32,"He didn't like that at all, and it would be mean to give one of them a clout. ",2668,2746
33,"At last, what should come through the town but a kind of bellman, only it's a big bugle he had, and a huntsman's cap on his head, and a kind of painted shirt. ",2746,2905
34,"So this--he wasn't a bellman, and I don't know what to call him--bugleman, maybe--proclaimed that the King of Dublin's daughter was so melancholy that she didn't give a laugh for seven years, and that her father would grant her in marriage to whoever would make her laugh three times. ",2905,3190
35,"""That's the very thing for me to try,"" says Tom. ",3190,3239
36,"So, without burning any more daylight, he kissed his mother, curled his club at the little boys, and he set off along the yalla highroad to the town of Dublin. ",3239,3399
37,"At last Tom came to one of the city gates, and the guards laughed and cursed at him instead of letting him through. ",3399,3515
38,"Tom stood it all for a little time, but at last one of them--out of fun, as he said--drove his bagnet half an inch or so into his side. ",3515,3651
39,Tom did nothing but take the fellow by the scruff of his neck and the waistband of his corduroys and fling him into the canal. ,3651,3778
40,"Some ran to pull the fellow out, and others to let manners into the vulgarian with their swords and daggers. ",3778,3887
41,"But a tap from his club sent them headlong into the moat or down on the stones, and they were soon begging him to stay his hands. ",3887,4017
42,So at last one of them was glad enough to show Tom the way to the palace yard. ,4017,4096
43,"There was the King and the Queen, and the princess in a gallery, looking at all sorts of wrestling and sword-playing, and rinka-fadhas (long dances) and mumming, all to please the princess. ",4096,4286
44,But not a smile came over her handsome face. ,4286,4331
45,"Well, they all stopped when they seen the young giant, with his boy's face and long black hair, and his short curly beard--for his poor mother couldn't afford to buy razhurs--and his great strong arms and bare legs, and no covering but the goat-skin that reached from his waist to his knees. ",4331,4623
46,"But an envious wizened basthard of a fellow, with a red head, that wished to be married to the princess, and didn't like how she opened her eyes at Tom, came forward, and asked his business very snappishly. ",4623,4830
47,"""My business,"" says Tom, says he, ""is to make the beautiful princess, God bless her, laugh three times."" ",4830,4935
48,"""Do you see all them merry fellows and skilful swordsmen,"" says the other, ""that could eat you up with a grain of salt, and not a mother's soul of them ever got a laugh from her these seven years?"" ",4935,5133
49,"So the fellows gathered round Tom, and the bad man aggravated him till he told them he didn't care a pinch of snuff for the whole bilin' of 'em. ",5133,5278
50,"Let 'em come on, six at a time, and try what they could do. ",5278,5338
51,"The King, that was too far off to hear what they were saying, asked what did the stranger want. ",5338,5434
52,"""He wants,"" says the red-headed fellow, ""to make hares of your best men."" ",5434,5508
53,"""Oh!"" ",5508,5514
54,"says the King, ""if that's the way, let one of 'em turn out and try his mettle."" ",5514,5594
55,"So one stood forward, with sword and pot-lid, and made a cut at Tom. ",5594,5663
56,"He struck the fellow's elbow with the club, and up over their heads flew the sword, and down went the owner of it on the gravel from a thump he got on the helmet. ",5663,5826
57,"Another took his place, and another, and another, and then half a dozen at once, and Tom sent swords, helmets, shields, and bodies rolling over and over, and themselves bawling out that they were kilt, and disabled, and damaged, and rubbing their poor elbows and hips, and limping away. ",5826,6113
58,Tom contrived not to kill anyone. ,6113,6147
59,The princess was so amused that she let a great sweet laugh out of her that was heard all over the yard. ,6147,6252
60,"""King of Dublin,"" says Tom, ""I've quarter of your daughter."" ",6252,6313
61,"And the King didn't know whether he was glad or sorry, and all the blood in the princess's heart run into her cheeks. ",6313,6431
62,"So there was no more fighting that day, and Tom was invited to dine with the royal family. ",6431,6522
63,"Next day Redhead told Tom of a wolf, the size of a yearling heifer, that used to be serenading (sauntering) about the walls, and eating people and cattle; ",6522,6677
64, and said what a pleasure it would give the King to have it killed. ,6676,6744
65,"""With all my heart,"" says Tom. ",6744,6775
66,"""Send a jackeen to show me where he lives, and we'll see how he behaves to a stranger."" ",6775,6863
67,"The princess was not well pleased, for Tom looked a different person with fine clothes and a nice green birredh over his long, curly hair; ",6863,7002
68," and besides, he'd got one laugh out of her. ",7001,7046
69,"However, the King gave his consent. ",7046,7082
70,"In an hour and a half the horrible wolf was walking in the palace yard, and Tom a step or two behind, with his club on his shoulder, just as a shepherd would be walking after a pet lamb. ",7082,7269
71,"The King and Queen and princess were safe up in their gallery, but the officers and people of the court that were padrowling about the great bawn, when they saw the big baste coming in gave themselves up, and began to make for doors and gates. ",7269,7513
72,"The wolf licked his chops, as if he was saying, ""Wouldn't I enjoy a breakfast off a couple of yez!"" ",7513,7613
73,"The King shouted out, ""O Gilla na Chreck an Gour, take away that terrible wolf, and you must have all my daughter."" ",7613,7729
74,But Tom didn't mind him a bit. ,7729,7760
75,He pulled out his flute and began to play like vengeance. ,7760,7818
76,"Dickens a man or boy in the yard but began shovelling away heel and toe, and the wolf himself was obliged to get on his hind legs and dance Tatther Jack Walsh along with the rest. ",7818,7998
77,"A good deal of the people got inside and shut the doors, the way the hairy fellow wouldn't pin them. ",7998,8099
78,"But Tom kept playing, and the outsiders kept shouting and dancing, and the wolf kept dancing and roaring with the pain his legs were giving him: and all the time he had his eyes on Redhead, who was shut out along with the rest. ",8099,8327
79,"Wherever Redhead went the wolf followed, and kept one eye on him and the other on Tom, to see if he would give him leave to eat him. ",8327,8460
80,"But Tom shook his head, and never stopped the tune. ",8460,8512
81,"Redhead never stopped dancing and bawling and the wolf dancing and roaring, one leg up and the other down, and he ready to drop out of his standing from fair tiresomeness. ",8512,8684
82,When the princess seen that there was no fear of anyone being kilt she was so divarted by the stew that Redhead was in that she gave another great laugh; ,8684,8838
83," and well become Tom, out he cried, ""King of Dublin, I have two quarters of your daughter."" ",8837,8929
84,"""Oh, quarters or alls,"" says the King, ""put away that divel of a wolf and we'll see about it."" ",8929,9024
85,"So Gilla put his flute in his pocket, and says he to the baste that was sittin' on his currabingo ready to faint, ""Walk off to your mountains, my fine fellow, and live like a respectable baste. ",9024,9218
86,"If ever I find you come within seven miles of any town----"" He said no more, but spit in his fist, and gave a flourish of his club. ",9218,9350
87,It was all the poor divel wanted. ,9350,9384
88,"He put his tail between his legs and took to his pumps without looking at man nor mortial, and neither sun, moon, nor stars ever saw him in sight of Dublin again. ",9384,9547
89,At dinner everyone laughed but the foxy fellow. ,9547,9595
90,"Sure enough, he was laying out how he'd settle poor Tom next day. ",9595,9661
91,"""Well, to be sure!"" ",9661,9681
92,"says he, ""King of Dublin, you are in luck. ",9681,9724
93,There's the Danes moidhering us to no end. ,9724,9767
94,D---- run to Lusk wid 'em! ,9767,9794
95,and if anyone can save us from 'em it is this gentleman with the goat-skin. ,9794,9870
96,"There is a flail hangin' on the collar-beam in Hell, and neither Dane nor Devil can stand before it."" ",9870,9972
97,"""So,"" says Tom to the King, ""will you let me have the other half of the princess if I bring you the flail?"" ",9972,10080
98,"""No, no,"" says the princess, ""I'd rather never be your wife than see you in that danger."" ",10080,10170
99,But Redhead whispered and nudged Tom about how shabby it would look to reneague the adventure. ,10170,10265
100,"So he asked him which way he was to go, and Redhead directed him through a street where a great many bad women lived, and a great many shibbeen houses were open, and away he set. ",10265,10444
101,"Well, he travelled and travelled till he came in sight of the walls of Hell; ",10444,10521
102," and, bedad, before he knocked at the gates, he rubbed himself over with the greenish ointment. ",10520,10616
103,"When he knocked a hundred little imps popped their heads out through the bars, and axed him what he wanted. ",10616,10724
104,"""I want to speak to the big divel of all,"" says Tom: ""open the gate."" ",10724,10794
105,"It wasn't long till the gate was thrune open, and the Ould Boy received Tom with bows and scrapes, and axed his business. ",10794,10916
106,"""My business isn't much,"" says Tom. ",10916,10952
107,"""I only came for the loan of that flail that I see hanging on the collar-beam for the King of Dublin to give a thrashing to the Danes."" ",10952,11088
108,"""Well,"" says the other, ""the Danes is much better customers to me. ",11088,11155
109,"But, since you walked so far, I won't refuse. ",11155,11201
110,"Hand that flail,"" says he to a young imp. ",11201,11243
111,He winked the far-off eye at the same time. ,11243,11287
112,"So while some were barring the gates, the young devil climbed up and took down the iron flail that had the handstaff and booltheen both made out of red-hot iron. ",11287,11449
113,"The little vagabond was grinning to think how it would burn the hands off of Tom, but the dickens a burn it made on him, no more nor if it was a good oak sapling. ",11449,11612
114,"""Thankee,"" says Tom; ",11612,11633
115," ""now would you open the gate for a body and I'll give you no more trouble."" ",11632,11709
116,"""Oh, tramp!"" ",11709,11722
117,"says Ould Nick, ""is that the way? ",11722,11756
118,It is easier getting inside them gates than getting out again. ,11756,11819
119,"Take that tool from him, and give him a dose of the oil of stirrup."" ",11819,11888
120,"So one fellow put out his claws to seize on the flail, but Tom gave him such a welt of it on the side of his head that he broke off one of his horns, and made him roar like a divel as he was. ",11888,12080
121,"Well, they rushed at Tom, but he gave them, little and big, such a thrashing as they didn't forget for a while. ",12080,12192
122,"At last says the ould thief of all, rubbing his elbows, ""Let the fool out; ",12192,12267
123," and woe to whoever lets him in again, great or small."" ",12266,12322
124,"So out marched Tom and away with him, without minding the shouting and cursing they kept up at him from the tops of the walls. ",12322,12449
125,"And when he got home to the big bawn of the palace, there never was such running and racing as to see himself and the flail. ",12449,12574
126,"When he had his story told he laid down the flail on the stone steps, and bid no one for their lives to touch it. ",12574,12688
127,If the King and Queen and princess made much of him before they made ten times as much of him now; ,12688,12787
128," but Redhead, the mean scruff-hound, stole over, and thought to catch hold of the flail to make an end of him. ",12786,12897
129,"His fingers hardly touched it, when he let a roar out of him as if heaven and earth were coming together, and kept flinging his arms about and dancing that it was pitiful to look at him. ",12897,13084
130,"Tom run at him as soon as he could rise, caught his hands in his own two, and rubbed them this way and that, and the burning pain left them before you could reckon one. ",13084,13253
131,"Well, the poor fellow, between the pain that was only just gone, and the comfort he was in, had the comicalest face that ever you see; ",13253,13388
132, it was such a mixerum-gatherum of laughing and crying. ,13387,13443
133,"Everyone burst out a laughing--the princess could not stop no more than the rest--and then says Gilla, or Tom, ""Now, ma'am, if there were fifty halves of you I hope you'll give me them all."" ",13443,13634
134,"Well, the princess had no mock modesty about her. ",13634,13684
135,"She looked at her father, and, by my word, she came over to Gilla and put her two delicate hands into his two rough ones, and I wish it was myself was in his shoes that day! ",13684,13858
136,Tom would not bring the flail into the palace. ,13858,13905
137,You may be sure no other body went near it; ,13905,13949
138," and when the early risers were passing next morning they found two long clefts in the stone where it was, after burning itself an opening downwards, nobody could tell how far. ",13948,14125
139,But a messenger came in at noon and said that the Danes were so frightened when they heard of the flail coming into Dublin that they got into their ships and sailed away. ,14125,14296
140,"Well, I suppose before they were married Gilla got some man like Pat Mara of Tomenine to larn him the ""principles of politeness,"" fluxions, gunnery, and fortifications, decimal fractions, practice, and the rule-of-three direct, the way he'd be able to keep up a conversation with the royal family. ",14296,14594
141,"Whether he ever lost his time larning them sciences, I'm not sure, but it's as sure as fate that his mother never more saw any want till the end of her days.",14594,14752
