0,"Long, long ago there lived, in Japan a brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda, or ""My Lord Bag of Rice."" ",0,108
1,"His true name was Fujiwara Hidesato, and there is a very interesting story of how he came to change his name. ",108,218
2,"One day he sallied forth in search of adventures, for he had the nature of a warrior and could not bear to be idle. ",218,334
3,"So he buckled on his two swords, took his huge bow, much taller than himself, in his hand, and slinging his quiver on his back started out. ",334,474
4,He had not gone far when he came to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa. ,474,585
5,No sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent-dragon. ,585,688
6,Its body was so big that it looked like the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the whole width of the bridge. ,688,805
7,"One of its huge claws rested on the parapet of one side of the bridge, while its tail lay right against the other. ",805,920
8,"The monster seemed to be asleep, and as it breathed, fire and smoke came out of its nostrils. ",920,1014
9,"At first Hidesato could not help feeling alarmed at the sight of this horrible reptile lying in his path, for he must either turn back or walk right over its body. ",1014,1178
10,"He was a brave man, however, and putting aside all fear went forward dauntlessly. ",1178,1260
11,"Crunch, crunch! ",1260,1276
12,"he stepped now on the dragon's body, now between its coils, and without even one glance backward he went on his way. ",1276,1393
13,He had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind. ,1393,1470
14,"On turning back he was much surprised to see that the monster dragon had entirely disappeared and in its place was a strange-looking man, who was bowing most ceremoniously to the ground. ",1470,1657
15,"His red hair streamed over his shoulders and was surmounted by a crown in the shape of a dragon's head, and his sea-green dress was patterned with shells. ",1657,1812
16,Hidesato knew at once that this was no ordinary mortal and he wondered much at the strange occurrence. ,1812,1915
17,Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time? ,1915,1972
18,"Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean? ",1972,2051
19,"While these thoughts passed through his mind he had come up to the man on the bridge and now addressed him: ""Was it you that called me just now?"" ",2051,2197
20,"""Yes, it was I,"" answered the man: ""I have an earnest request to make to you. ",2197,2275
21,"Do you think you can grant it to me?"" ",2275,2313
22,"""If it is in my power to do so I will,"" answered Hidesato, ""but first tell me who you are?"" ",2313,2405
23,"""I am the Dragon King of the Lake, and my home is in these waters just under this bridge."" ",2405,2496
24,"""And what is it you have to ask of me?"" ",2496,2536
25,said Hidesato. ,2536,2551
26,"""I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede, who lives on the mountain beyond,"" and the Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake. ",2551,2715
27,"""I have lived now for many years in this lake and I have a large family of children and grand-children. ",2715,2819
28,"For some time past we have lived in terror, for a monster centipede has discovered our home, and night after night it comes and carries off one of my family. ",2819,2977
29,I am powerless to save them. ,2977,3006
30,"If it goes on much longer like this, not only shall I lose all my children, but I myself must fall a victim to the monster. ",3006,3130
31,"I am, therefore, very unhappy, and in my extremity I determined to ask the help of a human being. ",3130,3228
32,"For many days with this intention I have waited on the bridge in the shape of the horrible serpent-dragon that you saw, in the hope that some strong brave man would come along. ",3228,3405
33,"But all who came this way, as soon as they saw me were terrified and ran away as fast as they could. ",3405,3506
34,"You are the first man I have found able to look at me without fear, so I knew at once that you were a man of great courage. ",3506,3630
35,I beg you to have pity upon me. ,3630,3662
36,"Will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede?"" ",3662,3717
37,"Hidesato felt very sorry for the Dragon King on hearing his story, and readily promised to do what he could to help him. ",3717,3838
38,"The warrior asked where the centipede lived, so that he might attack the creature at once. ",3838,3929
39,"The Dragon King replied that its home was on the mountain Mikami, but that as it came every night at a certain hour to the palace of the lake, it would be better to wait till then. ",3929,4110
40,"So Hidesato was conducted to the palace of the Dragon King, under the bridge. ",4110,4188
41,"Strange to say, as he followed his host downwards the waters parted to let them pass, and his clothes did not even feel damp as he passed through the flood. ",4188,4345
42,Never had Hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake. ,4345,4446
43,"He had often heard of the Sea King's palace at the bottom of the sea, where all the servants and retainers were salt-water fishes, but here was a magnificent building in the heart of Lake Biwa. ",4446,4640
44,"The dainty goldfishes, red carp, and silvery trout, waited upon the Dragon King and his guest. ",4640,4735
45,Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him. ,4735,4797
46,"The dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers, and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony. ",4797,4897
47,"As soon as they sat down, the sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish dancers came out, and behind them followed ten red-carp musicians with the koto and the samisen. ",4897,5069
48,"Thus the hours flew by till midnight, and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede. ",5069,5187
49,"The Dragon King was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken by a tramp, tramp! ",5187,5313
50,as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away. ,5313,5366
51,"Hidesato and his host both rose to their feet and rushed to the balcony, and the warrior saw on the opposite mountain two great balls of glowing fire coming nearer and nearer. ",5366,5542
52,The Dragon King stood by the warrior's side trembling with fear. ,5542,5607
53,"""The centipede! ",5607,5623
54,The centipede! ,5608,5623
55,Those two balls of fire are its eyes. ,5638,5676
56,It is coming for its prey! ,5676,5703
57,"Now is the time to kill it."" ",5703,5732
58,"Hidesato looked where his host pointed, and, in the dim light of the starlit evening, behind the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an enormous centipede winding round the mountains, and the light in its hundred feet glowed like so many distant lanterns moving slowly towards the shore. ",5732,6026
59,Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear. ,6026,6070
60,He tried to calm the Dragon King. ,6070,6104
61,"""Don't be afraid. ",6104,6122
62,I shall surely kill the centipede. ,6122,6157
63,"Just bring me my bow and arrows."" ",6157,6191
64,"The Dragon King did as he was bid, and the warrior noticed that he had only three arrows left in his quiver. ",6191,6300
65,"He took the bow, and fitting an arrow to the notch, took careful aim and let fly. ",6300,6382
66,"The arrow hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of penetrating, it glanced off harmless and fell to the ground. ",6382,6519
67,"Nothing daunted, Hidesato took another arrow, fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly. ",6519,6612
68,"Again the arrow hit the mark, it struck the centipede right in the middle of its head, only to glance off and fall to the ground. ",6612,6742
69,The centipede was invulnerable to weapons! ,6742,6785
70,"When the Dragon King saw that even this brave warrior's arrows were powerless to kill the centipede, he lost heart and began to tremble with fear. ",6785,6932
71,"The warrior saw that he had now only one arrow left in his quiver, and if this one failed he could not kill the centipede. ",6932,7055
72,He looked across the waters. ,7055,7084
73,The huge reptile had wound its horrid body seven times round the mountain and would soon come down to the lake. ,7084,7196
74,"Nearer and nearer gleamed fireballs of eyes, and the light of its hundred feet began to throw reflections in the still waters of the lake. ",7196,7335
75,Then suddenly the warrior remembered that he had heard that human saliva was deadly to centipedes. ,7335,7434
76,But this was no ordinary centipede. ,7434,7470
77,This was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature made one creep with horror. ,7470,7558
78,Hidesato determined to try his last chance. ,7558,7602
79,"So taking his last arrow and first putting the end of it in his mouth, he fitted the notch to his bow, took careful aim once more and let fly. ",7602,7745
80,"This time the arrow again hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of glancing off harmlessly as before, it struck home to the creature's brain. ",7745,7912
81,"Then with a convulsive shudder the serpentine body stopped moving, and the fiery light of its great eyes and hundred feet darkened to a dull glare like the sunset of a stormy day, and then went out in blackness. ",7912,8124
82,"A great darkness now overspread the heavens, the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, and the wind roared in fury, and it seemed as if the world were coming to an end. ",8124,8297
83,"The Dragon King and his children and retainers all crouched in different parts of the palace, frightened to death, for the building was shaken to its foundation. ",8297,8459
84,At last the dreadful night was over. ,8459,8496
85,Day dawned beautiful and clear. ,8496,8528
86,The centipede was gone from the mountain. ,8528,8570
87,"Then Hidesato called to the Dragon King to come out with him on the balcony, for the centipede was dead and he had nothing more to fear. ",8570,8707
88,"Then all the inhabitants of the palace came out with joy, and Hidesato pointed to the lake. ",8707,8799
89,"There lay the body of the dead centipede floating on the water, which was dyed red with its blood. ",8799,8898
90,The gratitude of the Dragon King knew no bounds. ,8898,8947
91,"The whole family came and bowed down before the warrior, calling him their preserver and the bravest warrior in all Japan. ",8947,9070
92,"Another feast was prepared, more sumptuous than the first. ",9070,9129
93,"All kinds of fish, prepared in every imaginable way, raw, stewed, boiled and roasted, served on coral trays and crystal dishes, were put before him, and the wine was the best that Hidesato had ever tasted in his life. ",9129,9347
94,"To add to the beauty of everything the sun shone brightly, the lake glittered like a liquid diamond, and the palace was a thousand times more beautiful by day than by night. ",9347,9521
95,"His host tried to persuade the warrior to stay a few days, but Hidesato insisted on going home, saying that he had now finished what he had come to do, and must return. ",9521,9690
96,"The Dragon King and his family were all very sorry to have him leave so soon, but since he would go they begged him to accept a few small presents (so they said) in token of their gratitude to him for delivering them forever from their horrible enemy the centipede. ",9690,9956
97,"As the warrior stood in the porch taking leave, a train of fish was suddenly transformed into a retinue of men, all wearing ceremonial robes and dragon's crowns on their heads to show that they were servants of the great Dragon King. ",9956,10190
98,"The presents that they carried were as follows: First, a large bronze bell. ",10190,10266
99,"Second, a bag of rice. ",10266,10289
100,"Third, a roll of silk. ",10289,10312
101,"Fourth, a cooking pot. ",10312,10335
102,"Fifth, a bell. ",10335,10350
103,"Hidesato did not want to accept all these presents, but as the Dragon King insisted, he could not well refuse. ",10350,10461
104,"The Dragon King himself accompanied the warrior as far as the bridge, and then took leave of him with many bows and good wishes, leaving the procession of servants to accompany Hidesato to his house with the presents. ",10461,10679
105,"The warrior's household and servants had been very much concerned when they found that he did not return the night before, but they finally concluded that he had been kept by the violent storm and had taken shelter somewhere. ",10679,10905
106,"When the servants on the watch for his return caught sight of him they called to every one that he was approaching, and the whole household turned out to meet him, wondering much what the retinue of men, bearing presents and banners, that followed him, could mean. ",10905,11170
107,"As soon as the Dragon King's retainers had put down the presents they vanished, and Hidesato told all that had happened to him. ",11170,11298
108,The presents which he had received from the grateful Dragon King were found to be of magic power. ,11298,11396
109,"The bell only was ordinary, and as Hidesato had no use for it he presented it to the temple near by, where it was hung up, to boom out the hour of day over the surrounding neighborhood. ",11396,11582
110,"The single bag of rice, however much was taken from it day after day for the meals of the knight and his whole family, never grew less-the supply in the bag was inexhaustible. ",11582,11758
111,"The roll of silk, too, never grew shorter, though time after time long pieces were cut off to make the warrior a new suit of clothes to go to Court in at the New Year. ",11758,11926
112,"The cooking pot was wonderful, too. ",11926,11962
113,"No matter what was put into it, it cooked deliciously whatever was wanted without any firing-truly a very economical saucepan. ",11962,12089
114,"The fame of Hidesato's fortune spread far and wide, and as there was no need for him to spend money on rice or silk or firing, he became very rich and prosperous, and was henceforth known as My Lord Bag of Rice.",12089,12301
