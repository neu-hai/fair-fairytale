0,DID you ever hear the story of the old street lamp? ,0,52
1,"It is not remarkably interesting, but for once you may as well listen to it. ",52,129
2,"It was a most respectable old lamp, which had seen many, many years of service and now was to retire with a pension. ",129,246
3,"It was this very evening at its post for the last time, giving light to the street. ",246,330
4,"Its feelings were something like those of an old dancer at the theater who is dancing for the last time and knows that on the morrow she will be in her garret, alone and forgotten. ",330,511
5,"The lamp had very great anxiety about the next day, for it knew that it had to appear for the first time at the town hall to be inspected by the mayor and the council, who were to decide whether it was fit for further service; ",511,738
6," whether it was good enough to be used to light the inhabitants of one of the suburbs, or in the country, at some factory. ",737,860
7,"If the lamp could not be used for one of these purposes, it would be sent at once to an iron foundry to be melted down. ",860,980
8,"In this latter case it might be turned into anything, and it wondered very much whether it would then be able to remember that it had once been a street lamp. ",980,1139
9,This troubled it exceedingly. ,1139,1169
10,"Whatever might happen, it seemed certain that the lamp would be separated from the watchman and his wife, whose family it looked upon as its own. ",1169,1315
11,"The lamp had first been hung up on the very evening that the watchman, then a robust young man, had entered upon the duties of his office. ",1315,1454
12,"Ah, well! ",1454,1464
13,it was a very long time since one became a lamp and the other a watchman. ,1464,1538
14,His wife had some little pride in those days; ,1538,1584
15, she condescended to glance at the lamp only when she passed by in the evening--never in the daytime. ,1583,1685
16,"But in later years, when all of them--the watchman, the wife, and the lamp--had grown old, she had attended to it, cleaning it and keeping it supplied with oil. ",1685,1846
17,The old people were thoroughly honest; ,1846,1885
18, they had never cheated the lamp of a single drop of the oil provided for it. ,1884,1962
19,"This was the lamp's last night in the street, and to-morrow it must go to the town hall--two very dark things to think of. ",1962,2085
20,No wonder it did not burn brightly. ,2085,2121
21,"How many persons it had lighted on their way, and how much it had seen! ",2121,2193
22,"As much, very likely, as the mayor and corporation themselves! ",2193,2256
23,"None of these thoughts were uttered aloud, however, for the lamp was good and honorable and would not willingly do harm to any one, especially to those in authority. ",2256,2422
24,"As one thing after another was recalled to its mind, the light would flash up with sudden brightness. ",2422,2524
25,At such moments the lamp had a conviction that it would be remembered. ,2524,2595
26,"""There was a handsome young man, once,"" thought the lamp; ",2595,2653
27," ""it is certainly a long while ago, but I remember that he had a little note, written on pink paper with a gold edge. ",2652,2770
28,"The writing was elegant, evidently a lady's. ",2770,2815
29,"Twice he read it through, and kissed it, and then looked up at me with eyes that said quite plainly, 'I am the happiest of men!' ",2815,2944
30,"Only he and I know what was written on this, his first letter from his lady-love. ",2944,3026
31,"Ah, yes, and there was another pair of eyes that I remember; ",3026,3087
32, it is really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thing to another! ,3086,3159
33,A funeral passed through the street. ,3159,3196
34,"A young and beautiful woman lay on a bier decked with garlands of flowers, and attended by torches which quite overpowered my light. ",3196,3329
35,"All along the street stood the people from the houses, in crowds, ready to join the procession. ",3329,3425
36,"But when the torches had passed from before me and I could look around, I saw one person standing alone, leaning against my post and weeping. ",3425,3567
37,"Never shall I forget the sorrowful eyes that looked up at me."" ",3567,3630
38,These and similar reflections occupied the old street lamp on this the last time that its light would shine. ,3630,3739
39,"The sentry, when he is relieved from his post, knows, at least, who will be his successor, and may whisper a few words to him. ",3739,3866
40,"But the lamp did not know its successor, or it might have given him a few hints respecting rain or mist and might have informed him how far the moon's rays would reach, and from which side the wind generally blew, and so on. ",3866,4091
41,"On the bridge over the canal stood three persons who wished to recommend themselves to the lamp, for they thought it could give the office to whomsoever it chose. ",4091,4254
42,"The first was a herring's head, which could emit light in the darkness. ",4254,4326
43,He remarked that it would be a great saving of oil if they placed him on the lamp-post. ,4326,4414
44,"Number two was a piece of rotten wood, which also shines in the dark. ",4414,4484
45,"He considered himself descended from an old stem, once the pride of the forest. ",4484,4564
46,"The third was a glowworm, and how he found his way there the lamp could not imagine; ",4564,4649
47," yet there he was, and could really give light as well as the others. ",4648,4718
48,"But the rotten wood and the herring's head declared most solemnly, by all they held sacred, that the glowworm only gave light at certain times and must not be allowed to compete with them. ",4718,4907
49,"The old lamp assured them that not one of them could give sufficient light to fill the position of a street lamp, but they would believe nothing that it said. ",4907,5066
50,"When they discovered that it had not the power of naming its successor, they said they were very glad to hear it, for the lamp was too old and worn out to make a proper choice. ",5066,5243
51,At this moment the wind came rushing round the corner of the street and through the air-holes of the old lamp. ,5243,5354
52,"""What is this I hear?"" ",5354,5377
53,it asked. ,5377,5387
54,"""Are you going away to-morrow? ",5387,5418
55,Is this evening the last time we shall meet? ,5418,5463
56,Then I must present you with a farewell gift. ,5463,5509
57,"I will blow into your brain, so that in future not only shall you be able to remember all that you have seen or heard in the past, but your light within shall be so bright that you will be able to understand all that is said or done in your presence."" ",5509,5761
58,"""Oh, that is really a very, very great gift,"" said the old lamp. ",5761,5826
59,"""I thank you most heartily. ",5826,5854
60,"I only hope I shall not be melted down."" ",5854,5895
61,"""That is not likely to happen yet,"" said the wind. ",5895,5946
62,"""I will also blow a memory into you, so that, should you receive other similar presents, your old age will pass very pleasantly."" ",5946,6076
63,"""That is, if I am not melted down,"" said the lamp. ",6076,6127
64,"""But should I, in that case, still retain my memory?"" ",6127,6181
65,"""Do be reasonable, old lamp,"" said the wind, puffing away. ",6181,6240
66,At this moment the moon burst forth from the clouds. ,6240,6293
67,"""What will you give the old lamp?"" ",6293,6328
68,asked the wind. ,6328,6344
69,"""I can give nothing,"" she replied. ",6344,6379
70,"""I am on the wane, and no lamps have ever given me light, while I have frequently shone upon them."" ",6379,6479
71,"With these words the moon hid herself again behind the clouds, that she might be saved from further importunities. ",6479,6594
72,"Just then a drop fell upon the lamp from the roof of the house, but the drop explained that it was a gift from those gray clouds and perhaps the best of all gifts. ",6594,6758
73,"""I shall penetrate you so thoroughly,"" it said, ""that you will have the power of becoming rusty, and, if you wish it, can crumble into dust in one night."" ",6758,6913
74,"But this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present, and the wind thought so, too. ",6913,6994
75,"""Does no one give any more? ",6994,7022
76,"Will no one give any more?"" ",7022,7050
77,"shouted the breath of the wind, as loud as it could. ",7050,7103
78,"Then a bright, falling star came down, leaving a broad, luminous streak behind it. ",7103,7186
79,"""What was that?"" ",7186,7203
80,cried the herring's head. ,7203,7229
81,"""Did not a star fall? ",7229,7251
82,I really believe it went into the lamp. ,7251,7291
83,"Certainly, when such high-born personages try for the office we may as well go home."" ",7291,7377
84,"And so they did, all three, while the old lamp threw a wonderfully strong light all around. ",7377,7469
85,"""This is a glorious gift,"" it said. ",7469,7505
86,"""The bright stars have always been a joy to me and have always shone more brilliantly than I ever could shine, though I have tried with my whole might. ",7505,7657
87,"Now they have noticed me, a poor old lamp, and have sent me a gift that will enable me to see clearly everything that I remember, as if it still stood before me, and to let it be seen by all those who love me. ",7657,7867
88,"And herein lies the truest happiness, for pleasures which we cannot share with others are only half enjoyed."" ",7867,7977
89,"""That sentiment does you honor,"" said the wind; ",7977,8025
90," ""but for this purpose wax lights will be necessary. ",8024,8077
91,"If these are not lighted in you, your peculiar faculties will not benefit others in the least. ",8077,8172
92,The stars have not thought of this. ,8172,8208
93,They suppose that you and every other light must be a wax taper. ,8208,8273
94,"But I must go down now."" ",8273,8298
95,So it laid itself to rest. ,8298,8325
96,"""Wax tapers, indeed!"" ",8325,8347
97,said the lamp; ,8347,8362
98," ""I have never yet had these, nor is it likely I ever shall. ",8361,8422
99,"If I could only be sure of not being melted down!"" ",8422,8473
100,"The next day--well, perhaps we had better pass over the next day. ",8473,8539
101,"The evening had come, and the lamp was resting in a grandfather's chair; ",8539,8612
102, and guess where! ,8611,8629
103,"Why, at the old watchman's house. ",8629,8663
104,"He had begged as a favor that the mayor and corporation would allow him to keep the street lamp in consideration of his long and faithful service, as he had himself hung it up and lighted it on the day he first commenced his duties, four and twenty years ago. ",8663,8923
105,He looked upon it almost as his own child. ,8923,8966
106,"He had no children, so the lamp was given to him. ",8966,9016
107,There lay the lamp in the great armchair near the warm stove. ,9016,9078
108,"It seemed almost to have grown larger, for it appeared quite to fill the chair. ",9078,9158
109,"The old people sat at their supper, casting friendly glances at it, and would willingly have admitted it to a place at the table. ",9158,9288
110,"It is quite true that they dwelt in a cellar two yards below ground, and had to cross a stone passage to get to their room. ",9288,9412
111,"But within, it was warm and comfortable, and strips of list had been nailed round the door. ",9412,9504
112,"The bed and the little window had curtains, and everything looked clean and neat. ",9504,9586
113,"On the window seat stood two curious flowerpots, which a sailor named Christian had brought from the East or West Indies. ",9586,9708
114,"They were of clay, and in the form of two elephants with open backs; ",9708,9777
115," they were filled with earth, and through the open space flowers bloomed. ",9776,9850
116,In one grew some very fine chives or leeks; ,9850,9894
117, this was the kitchen garden. ,9893,9923
118,"The other, which contained a beautiful geranium, they called their flower garden. ",9923,10005
119,"On the wall hung a large colored print, representing the Congress of Vienna and all the kings and emperors. ",10005,10113
120,"A clock with heavy weights hung on the wall and went ""tick, tick,"" steadily enough; ",10113,10197
121," yet it was always rather too fast, which, however, the old people said was better than being too slow. ",10196,10300
122,"They were now eating their supper, while the old street lamp, as we have heard, lay in the grandfather's armchair near the stove. ",10300,10430
123,It seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned round. ,10430,10492
124,"But after a while the old watchman looked at the lamp and spoke of what they had both gone through together--in rain and in fog, during the short, bright nights of summer or in the long winter nights, through the drifting snowstorms when he longed to be at home in the cellar. ",10492,10769
125,Then the lamp felt that all was well again. ,10769,10813
126,"It saw everything that had happened quite clearly, as if the events were passing before it. ",10813,10905
127,Surely the wind had given it an excellent gift! ,10905,10953
128,The old people were very active and industrious; ,10953,11002
129, they were never idle for even a single hour. ,11001,11047
130,"On Sunday afternoons they would bring out some books, generally a book of travels which they greatly liked. ",11047,11155
131,"The old man would read aloud about Africa, with its great forests and the wild elephants, while his wife would listen attentively, stealing a glance now and then at the clay elephants which served as flowerpots. ",11155,11367
132,"""I can almost imagine I am seeing it all,"" she said. ",11367,11420
133,Ah! ,11420,11424
134,"how the lamp wished for a wax taper to be lighted in it, for then the old woman would have seen the smallest detail as clearly as it did itself; ",11424,11569
135," the lofty trees, with their thickly entwined branches, the naked negroes on horseback, and whole herds of elephants treading down bamboo thickets with their broad, heavy feet. ",11568,11745
136,"""What is the use of all my capabilities,"" sighed the old lamp, ""when I cannot obtain any wax lights? ",11745,11846
137,"They have only oil and tallow here, and these will not do."" ",11846,11906
138,One day a great heap of wax-candle ends found their way into the cellar. ,11906,11979
139,"The larger pieces were burned, and the smaller ones the old woman kept for waxing her thread. ",11979,12073
140,"So there were now candles enough, but it never occurred to any one to put a little piece in the lamp. ",12073,12175
141,"""Here I am now, with my rare powers,"" thought the lamp. ",12175,12231
142,"""I have faculties within me, but I cannot share them. ",12231,12285
143,"They do not know that I could cover these white walls with beautiful tapestry, or change them into noble forests or, indeed, to anything else they might wish."" ",12285,12445
144,"The lamp, however, was always kept clean and shining in a corner, where it attracted all eyes. ",12445,12540
145,"Strangers looked upon it as lumber, but the old people did not care for that; ",12540,12618
146, they loved it. ,12617,12633
147,"One day--it was the watchman's birthday--the old woman approached the lamp, smiling to herself, and said, ""I will have an illumination to-day, in honor of my old man."" ",12633,12801
148,"The lamp rattled in its metal frame, for it thought, ""Now at last I shall have a light within me."" ",12801,12900
149,"But, after all, no wax light was placed in the lamp--only oil, as usual. ",12900,12973
150,The lamp burned through the whole evening and began to perceive too clearly that the gift of the stars would remain a hidden treasure all its life. ,12973,13121
151,Then it had a dream; ,13121,13142
152," for to one with its faculties, dreaming was not difficult. ",13141,13201
153,It dreamed that the old people were dead and that it had been taken to the iron foundry to be melted down. ,13201,13308
154,This caused the lamp quite as much anxiety as on the day when it had been called upon to appear before the mayor and the council at the town hall. ,13308,13455
155,"But though it had been endowed with the power of falling into decay from rust when it pleased, it did not make use of this power. ",13455,13585
156,It was therefore put into the melting furnace and changed into as elegant an iron candlestick as you could wish to see--one intended to hold a wax taper. ,13585,13739
157,"The candlestick was in the form of an angel holding a nosegay, in the center of which the wax taper was to be placed. ",13739,13857
158,"It was to stand on a green writing table in a very pleasant room, where there were many books scattered about and splendid paintings on the walls. ",13857,14004
159,The owner of the room was a poet and a man of intellect. ,14004,14061
160,Everything he thought or wrote was pictured around him. ,14061,14117
161,"Nature showed herself to him sometimes in the dark forests, sometimes in cheerful meadows where the storks were strutting about, or on the deck of a ship sailing across the foaming sea, with the clear, blue sky above, or at night in the glittering stars. ",14117,14372
162,"""What powers I possess!"" ",14372,14397
163,"said the lamp, awaking from its dream. ",14397,14436
164,"""I could almost wish to be melted down; ",14436,14476
165," but no, that must not be while the old people live. ",14475,14528
166,They love me for myself alone; ,14528,14559
167, they keep me bright and supply me with oil. ,14558,14603
168,"I am as well off as the picture of the Congress, in which they take so much pleasure."" ",14603,14690
169,"And from that time it felt at rest in itself, and not more so than such an honorable old lamp really deserved to be.",14690,14807
