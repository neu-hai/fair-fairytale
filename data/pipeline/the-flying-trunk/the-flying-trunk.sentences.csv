0,"There was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street, and perhaps even a little side-street besides, with silver. ",0,145
1,But he did not do that; ,145,169
2, he knew another way of spending his money. ,168,212
3,If he spent a shilling he got back a florin-such an excellent merchant he was till he died. ,212,304
4,Now his son inherited all this money. ,304,342
5,He lived very merrily; ,342,365
6," he went every night to the theatre, made paper kites out of five-pound notes, and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones. ",364,506
7,"In this way the money was likely to come soon to an end, and so it did. ",506,578
8,"At last he had nothing left but four shillings, and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing-gown. ",578,700
9,His friends did not trouble themselves any more about him; ,700,759
10, they would not even walk down the street with him. ,758,810
11,"But one of them who was rather good-natured sent him an old trunk with the message, ""Pack up!"" ",810,905
12,"That was all very well, but he had nothing to pack up, so he got into the trunk himself. ",905,994
13,"It was an enchanted trunk, for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly. ",994,1071
14,"He pressed it, and away he flew in it up the chimney, high into the clouds, further and further away. ",1071,1173
15,"But whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces, for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault-just think of it! ",1173,1340
16,In this way he arrived at the land of the Turks. ,1340,1389
17,"He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves, and then walked into the town. ",1389,1470
18,"He could do that quite well, for all the Turks were dressed just as he was-in a dressing-gown and slippers. ",1470,1578
19,He met a nurse with a little child. ,1578,1614
20,'Halloa! ,1614,1623
21,"you Turkish nurse,' said he, 'what is that great castle there close to the town? ",1623,1704
22,The one with the windows so high up?' ,1704,1742
23,"'The sultan's daughter lives there,' she replied. ",1742,1792
24,"'It is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband, and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by.' ",1792,1936
25,"'Thank you,' said the merchant's son, and he went into the wood, sat himself in his trunk, flew on to the roof, and crept through the window into the princess's room. ",1936,2103
26,"She was lying on the sofa asleep, and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her. ",2103,2199
27,"Then she woke up and was very much frightened, but he said he was a Turkish god who had come through the air to see her, and that pleased her very much. ",2199,2352
28,"They sat close to each other, and he told her a story about her eyes. ",2352,2422
29,They were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids. ,2422,2501
30,"And her forehead was a snowy mountain, grand and shining. ",2501,2559
31,These were lovely stories. ,2559,2586
32,"Then he asked the princess to marry him, and she said yes at once. ",2586,2653
33,"'But you must come here on Saturday,' she said, 'for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me. ",2653,2765
34,They will be indeed proud that I receive the god of the Turks. ,2765,2828
35,"But mind you have a really good story ready, for my parents like them immensely. ",2828,2909
36,"My mother likes something rather moral and high-flown, and my father likes something merry to make him laugh.' ",2909,3020
37,"'Yes, I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry,' said he, and so they parted. ",3020,3103
38,But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use. ,3103,3178
39,"Then he flew away, bought himself a new dressing-gown, and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story, for it had to be ready by Saturday, and that was no easy matter. ",3178,3353
40,When he had it ready it was Saturday. ,3353,3391
41,"The sultan, the sultana, and the whole court were at tea with the princess. ",3391,3467
42,He was most graciously received. ,3467,3500
43,'Will you tell us a story?' ,3500,3528
44,said the sultana; ,3528,3546
45, 'one that is thoughtful and instructive?' ,3545,3588
46,"'But something that we can laugh at,' said the sultan. ",3588,3643
47,"'Oh, certainly,' he replied, and began: 'Now, listen attentively. ",3643,3709
48,"There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot, and they told the story of their youth.' ",3709,3834
49,"""We used to be on the green fir-boughs. ",3834,3874
50,"Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea, which was the dew, and the whole day long we had sunshine, and the little birds used to tell us stories. ",3874,4025
51,"We were very rich, because the other trees only dressed in summer, but we had green dresses in summer and in winter. ",4025,4142
52,"Then the woodcutter came, and our family was split up. ",4142,4197
53,We have now the task of making light for the lowest people. ,4197,4257
54,"That is why we grand people are in the kitchen."" ",4257,4306
55,"""My fate was quite different,"" said the iron pot, near which the matches lay. ",4306,4384
56,"""Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured, and have cooked much. ",4384,4467
57,"My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner."" ",4467,4584
58,"""Now you are talking too fast,"" spluttered the fire. ",4584,4637
59,"""Yes, let us decide who is the grandest!"" ",4637,4679
60,said the matches. ,4679,4697
61,"""No, I don't like talking about myself,"" said the pot. ",4697,4752
62,"""Let us arrange an evening's entertainment. ",4752,4796
63,"I will tell the story of my life."" ",4796,4831
64,"""On the Baltic by the Danish shore-"" ""What a beautiful beginning!"" ",4831,4898
65,said all the plates. ,4898,4919
66,"""That's a story that will please us all."" ",4919,4961
67,And the end was just as good as the beginning. ,4961,5008
68,All the plates clattered for joy. ,5008,5042
69,"""Now I will dance,"" said the tongs, and she danced. ",5042,5094
70,Oh! ,5094,5098
71,how high she could kick! ,5098,5123
72,The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her. ,5123,5180
73,The urn would have sung but she said she had a cold; ,5180,5233
74, she could not sing unless she boiled. ,5232,5271
75,In the window was an old quill pen. ,5271,5307
76,There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink. ,5307,5403
77,But she was very proud of that. ,5403,5435
78,"""If the urn will not sing,"" said she, ""outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing."" ",5435,5537
79,"""I don't think it's proper,"" said the kettle, ""that such a foreign bird should be heard."" ",5537,5627
80,"""Oh, let us have some acting,"" said everyone. ",5627,5673
81,"""Do let us!"" ",5673,5686
82,Suddenly the door opened and the maid came in. ,5686,5733
83,Everyone was quite quiet. ,5733,5759
84,There was not a sound. ,5759,5782
85,"But each pot knew what he might have done, and how grand he was. ",5782,5847
86,The maid took the matches and lit the fire with them. ,5847,5901
87,"How they spluttered and flamed, to be sure! ",5901,5945
88,"""Now everyone can see,"" they thought, ""that we are the grandest! ",5945,6010
89,How we sparkle! ,6010,6026
90,"What a light-"" 'But here they were burnt out.' ",6026,6073
91,'That was a delightful story!' ,6073,6104
92,said the sultana. ,6104,6122
93,'I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches. ,6122,6176
94,"Yes, now you shall marry our daughter.' ",6176,6216
95,"'Yes, indeed,' said the sultan, 'you shall marry our daughter on Monday.' ",6216,6290
96,And they treated the young man as one of the family. ,6290,6343
97,"The wedding was arranged, and the night before the whole town was illuminated. ",6343,6422
98,"Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people, the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers. ",6422,6562
99,It was all splendid. ,6562,6583
100,"'Now I must also give them a treat,' thought the merchant's son. ",6583,6648
101,"And so he bought rockets, crackers, and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of, put them in his trunk, and flew up with them into the air. ",6648,6792
102,"Whirr-r-r, how they fizzed and blazed! ",6792,6831
103,All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads; ,6831,6904
104, such a splendid glitter they had never seen before. ,6903,6956
105,Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess. ,6956,7065
106,"As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought, 'Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken.' ",7065,7218
107,And it was quite natural that he should want to do this. ,7218,7275
108,Oh! ,5094,5098
109,what stories the people had to tell! ,7279,7316
110,"Each one whom he asked had seen it differently, but they had all found it beautiful. ",7316,7401
111,"'I saw the Turkish god himself,' said one. ",7401,7444
112,"'He had eyes like glittering stars, and a beard like foaming water.' ",7444,7513
113,"'He flew away in a cloak of fire,' said another. ",7513,7562
114,"They were splendid things that he heard, and the next day was to be his wedding day. ",7562,7647
115,Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk; ,7647,7700
116, but what had become of it? ,7699,7727
117,The trunk had been burnt. ,7727,7753
118,"A spark of the fireworks had set it alight, and the trunk was in ashes. ",7753,7825
119,"He could no longer fly, and could never reach his bride. ",7825,7882
120,She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited; ,7882,7935
121, perhaps she is waiting there still. ,7934,7971
122,But he wandered through the world and told stories; ,7971,8023
123, though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches.,8022,8090
