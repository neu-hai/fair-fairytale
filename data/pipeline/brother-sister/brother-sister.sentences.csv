0,"THE brother took his sister's hand and said to her, ""Since our mother died we have had no good days; ",0,101
1," our stepmother beats us every day, and if we go near her she kicks us away; ",100,177
2, we have nothing to eat but hard crusts of bread left over; ,176,236
3, the dog under the table fares better; ,235,274
4, he gets a good piece every now and then. ,273,315
5,"If our mother only knew, how she would pity us! ",315,363
6,"Come, let us go together out into the wide world!"" ",363,414
7,"So they went, and journeyed the whole day through fields and meadows and stony places, and if it rained the sister said, ""The skies and we are weeping together."" ",414,576
8,"In the evening they came to a great wood, and they were so weary with hunger and their long journey, that they climbed up into a high tree and fell asleep. ",576,732
9,"The next morning, when they awoke, the sun was high in heaven, and shone brightly through the leaves. ",732,834
10,"Then said the brother, ""Sister, I am thirsty; ",834,880
11," if I only knew where to find a brook, that I might go and drink! ",879,945
12,"I almost think that I hear one rushing."" ",945,986
13,"So the brother got down and led his sister by the hand, and they went to seek the brook. ",986,1075
14,"But their wicked stepmother was a witch, and had known quite well that the two children had run away, and had sneaked after them, as only witches can, and had laid a spell on all the brooks in the forest. ",1075,1280
15,"So when they found a little stream flowing smoothly over its pebbles, the brother was going to drink of it; ",1280,1388
16," but the sister heard how it said in its rushing, ""He a tiger will be who drinks of me, Who drinks of me a tiger will be!"" ",1387,1510
17,"Then the sister cried, ""Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and will tear me in pieces."" ",1510,1630
18,"So the brother refrained from drinking, though his thirst was great, and he said he would wait till he came to the next brook. ",1630,1757
19,"When they came to a second brook the sister heard it say, ""He a wolf will be who drinks of me, Who drinks of me a wolf will be!"" ",1757,1886
20,"Then the sister cried, ""Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will be turned into a wolf, and will eat me up!"" ",1886,2000
21,"So the brother refrained from drinking, and said, ""I will wait until we come to the next brook, and then I must drink, whatever you say; ",2000,2137
22," my thirst is so great."" ",2136,2161
23,"And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how in its rushing it said, ""Who drinks of me a fawn will be, He a fawn will be who drinks of me!"" ",2161,2315
24,"Then the sister said, ""O my brother, I pray drink not, or you will be turned into a fawn, and run away far from me."" ",2315,2432
25,"But he had already kneeled by the side of the brook and stooped and drunk of the water, and as the first drops passed his lips he became a fawn. ",2432,2577
26,"And the sister wept over her poor lost brother, and the fawn wept also, and stayed sadly beside her. ",2577,2678
27,"At last the maiden said, ""Be comforted, dear fawn, indeed I will never leave you."" ",2678,2761
28,"Then she untied her golden girdle and bound it round the fawn's neck, and went and gathered rushes to make a soft cord, which she fastened to him; ",2761,2908
29," and then she led him on, and they went deeper into the forest. ",2907,2971
30,"And when they had gone a long long way, they came at last to a little house, and the maiden looked inside, and as it was empty she thought, ""We might as well live here."" ",2971,3141
31,"And she fetched leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn, and every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and fresh grass for the fawn, who ate out of her hand with joy, frolicking round her. ",3141,3376
32,"At night, when the sister was tired, and had said her prayers, she laid her head on the fawn's back, which served her for a pillow, and softly fell asleep. ",3376,3532
33,"And if only the brother could have got back his own shape again, it would have been a charming life. ",3532,3633
34,So they lived a long while in the wilderness alone. ,3633,3685
35,Now it happened that the King of that country held a great hunt in the forest. ,3685,3764
36,"The blowing of the horns, the barking of the dogs, and the lusty shouts of the huntsmen sounded through the wood, and the fawn heard them and was eager to be among them. ",3764,3934
37,"""Oh,"" said he to his sister, ""do let me go to the hunt; ",3934,3990
38," I cannot stay behind any longer,"" and begged so long that at last she consented. ",3989,4071
39,"""But mind,"" said she to him, ""come back to me at night. ",4071,4127
40,"I must lock my door against the wild hunters, so, in order that I may know you, you must knock and say, 'Little sister, let me in,' and unless I hear that I shall not unlock the door."" ",4127,4312
41,"Then the fawn sprang out, and felt glad and merry in the open air. ",4312,4379
42,"The King and his huntsmen saw the beautiful animal, and began at once to pursue him, but they could not come within reach of him, for when they thought they were certain of him he sprang away over the bushes and disappeared. ",4379,4604
43,"As soon as it was dark he went back to the little house, knocked at the door, and said, ""Little sister, let me in."" ",4604,4720
44,"Then the door was opened to him, and he went in, and rested the whole night long on his soft bed. ",4720,4818
45,"The next morning the hunt began anew, and when the fawn heard the hunting-horns and the tally-ho of the huntsmen he could rest no longer, and said, ""Little sister, let me out, I must go."" ",4818,5006
46,"The sister opened the door and said, ""Now, mind you must come back at night and say the same words."" ",5006,5107
47,"When the King and his hunters saw the fawn with the golden collar again, they chased him closely, but he was too nimble and swift for them. ",5107,5247
48,"This lasted the whole day, and at last the hunters surrounded him, and one of them wounded his foot a little, so that he was obliged to limp and to go slowly. ",5247,5406
49,"Then a hunter slipped after him to the little house, and heard how he called out, ""Little sister, let me in,"" and saw the door open and shut again after him directly. ",5406,5573
50,"The hunter noticed all this carefully, went to the King, and told him all he had seen and heard. ",5573,5670
51,"Then said the King, ""To-morrow we will hunt again."" ",5670,5722
52,But the sister was very terrified when she saw that her fawn was wounded. ,5722,5796
53,"She washed his foot, laid cooling leaves round it, and said, ""Lie down on your bed, dear fawn, and rest, that you may be soon well."" ",5796,5929
54,"The wound was very slight, so that the fawn felt nothing of it the next morning. ",5929,6010
55,"And when he heard the noise of the hunting outside, he said, ""I cannot stay in, I must go after them; ",6010,6112
56," I shall not be taken easily again!"" ",6111,6148
57,"The sister began to weep, and said, ""I know you will be killed, and I left alone here in the forest, and forsaken of everybody. ",6148,6276
58,"I cannot let you go!"" ",6276,6298
59,"""Then I shall die here with longing,"" answered the fawn; ",6298,6355
60," ""when I hear the sound of the horn I feel as if I should leap out of my skin."" ",6354,6434
61,"Then the sister, seeing there was no help for it, unlocked the door with a heavy heart, and the fawn bounded away into the forest, well and merry. ",6434,6581
62,"When the King saw him, he said to his hunters, ""Now, follow him up all day long till the night comes, and see that you do him no hurt."" ",6581,6717
63,"So as soon as the sun had gone down, the King said to the huntsmen: ""Now, come and show me the little house in the wood."" ",6717,6839
64,"And when he got to the door he knocked at it, and cried, ""Little sister, let me in!"" ",6839,6924
65,"Then the door opened, and the King went in, and there stood a maiden more beautiful than any he had seen before. ",6924,7037
66,"The maiden shrieked out when she saw, instead of the fawn, a man standing there with a gold crown on his head. ",7037,7148
67,"But the King looked kindly on her, took her by the hand, and said, ""Will you go with me to my castle, and be my dear wife?"" ",7148,7272
68,"""Oh yes,"" answered the maiden, ""but the fawn must come too. ",7272,7332
69,"I could not leave him."" ",7332,7356
70,"And the King said, ""He shall remain with you as long as you live, and shall lack nothing."" ",7356,7447
71,"Then the fawn came bounding in, and the sister tied the cord of rushes to him, and led him by her own hand out of the little house. ",7447,7579
72,"The King put the beautiful maiden on his horse, and carried her to his castle, where the wedding was held with great pomp; ",7579,7702
73," so she became lady Queen, and they lived together happily for a long while; ",7701,7778
74," the fawn was well tended and cherished, and he gambolled about the castle garden. ",7777,7860
75,"Now the wicked stepmother, whose fault it was that the children were driven out into the world, never dreamed but that the sister had been eaten up by wild beasts in the forest, and that the brother, in the likeness of a fawn, had been slain by the hunters. ",7860,8118
76,"But when she heard that they were so happy, and that things had gone so well with them, jealousy and envy arose in her heart, and left her no peace, and her chief thought was how to bring misfortune upon them. ",8118,8328
77,"Her own daughter, who was as ugly as sin, and had only one eye, complained to her, and said, ""I never had the chance of being a Queen."" ",8328,8464
78,"""Never mind,"" said the old woman, to satisfy her; ",8464,8514
79," ""when the time comes, I shall be at hand."" ",8513,8557
80,"After a while the Queen brought a beautiful baby-boy into the world, and that day the King was out hunting. ",8557,8665
81,"The old witch took the shape of the bedchamber woman, and went into the room where the Queen lay, and said to her, ""Come, the bath is ready; ",8665,8806
82, it will give you refreshment and new strength. ,8805,8853
83,"Quick, or it will be cold."" ",8853,8881
84,"Her daughter was within call, so they carried the sick Queen into the bath-room, and left her there. ",8881,8982
85,"And in the bath-room they had made a great fire, so as to suffocate the beautiful young Queen. ",8982,9077
86,"When that was managed, the old woman took her daughter, put a cap on her, and laid her in the bed in the Queen's place, gave her also the Queen's form and countenance, only she could not restore the lost eye. ",9077,9286
87,"So, in order that the King might not remark it, she had to lie on the side where there was no eye. ",9286,9385
88,"In the evening, when the King came home and heard that a little son was born to him, he rejoiced with all his heart, and was going at once to his dear wife's bedside to see how she did. ",9385,9571
89,"Then the old woman cried hastily, ""For your life, do not draw back the curtains, to let in the light upon her; ",9571,9682
90," she must be kept quiet."" ",9681,9707
91,"So the King went away, and never knew that a false Queen was lying in the bed. ",9707,9786
92,"Now, when it was midnight, and every one was asleep, the nurse, who was sitting by the cradle in the nursery and watching there alone, saw the door open, and the true Queen come in. ",9786,9968
93,"She took the child out of the cradle, laid it in her bosom, and fed it. ",9968,10040
94,"Then she shook out its little pillow, put the child back again, and covered it with the coverlet. ",10040,10138
95,"She did not forget the fawn either: she went to him where he lay in the corner, and stroked his back tenderly. ",10138,10249
96,"Then she went in perfect silence out at the door, and the nurse next morning asked the watchmen if any one had entered the castle during the night, but they said they had seen no one. ",10249,10433
97,"And the Queen came many nights, and never said a word; ",10433,10488
98," the nurse saw her always, but she did not dare speak of it to any one. ",10487,10559
99,"After some time had gone by in this manner, the Queen seemed to find voice, and said one night, ""My child my fawn twice more I come to see, Twice more I come, and then the end must be."" ",10559,10745
100,"The nurse said nothing, but as soon as the Queen had disappeared she went to the King and told him all. ",10745,10849
101,"The King said, ""Ah, heaven! ",10849,10877
102,what do I hear! ,10877,10893
103,"I will myself watch by the child to-morrow night."" ",10893,10944
104,"So at evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the Queen appeared, and said, ""My child my fawn once more I come to see, Once more I come, and then the end must be."" ",10944,11118
105,"And she tended the child, as she was accustomed to do, before she vanished. ",11118,11194
106,"The King dared not speak to her, but he watched again the following night, and heard her say, ""My child my fawn this once I come to see, This once I come, and now the end must be."" ",11194,11375
107,"Then the King could contain himself no longer, but rushed towards her, saying, ""You are no other than my dear wife!"" ",11375,11492
108,"Then she answered, ""Yes, I am your dear wife,"" and in that moment, by the grace of heaven, her life returned to her, and she was once more well and strong. ",11492,11648
109,Then she told the King the snare that the wicked witch and her daughter had laid for her. ,11648,11738
110,"The King had them both brought to judgment, and sentence was passed upon them. ",11738,11817
111,"The daughter was sent away into the wood, where she was devoured by the wild beasts, and the witch was burned, and ended miserably. ",11817,11949
112,"And as soon as her body was in ashes the spell was removed from the fawn, and he took human shape again; ",11949,12054
113, and then the sister and brother lived happily together until the end.,12053,12124
