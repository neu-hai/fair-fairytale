0,"ONCE on a time the cock and the hen went to the nut mountain, and they agreed beforehand that whichever of them should find a nut was to divide it with the other. ",0,163
1,"Now the hen found a great big nut, but said nothing about it, and was going to eat it all alone, but the kernel was such a fat one that she could not swallow it down, and it stuck in her throat, so that she was afraid she should choke. ",163,399
2,"""Cock!"" ",399,407
3,"cried she, ""run as fast as you can and fetch me some water, or I shall choke!"" ",407,486
4,"So the cock ran as fast as he could to the brook, and said, ""Brook, give me some water, the hen is up yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat."" ",486,640
5,"But the brook answered, ""First run to the bride and ask her for some red silk."" ",640,720
6,"So the cock ran to the bride and said, ""Bride, give me some red silk; ",720,790
7, the brook wants me to give him some red silk; ,789,836
8," I want him to give me some water, for the hen lies yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat."" ",835,939
9,"But the bride answered, ""First go and fetch me my garland that hangs on a willow."" ",939,1022
10,"And the cock ran to the willow and pulled the garland from the bough and brought it to the bride, and the bride gave him red silk, and he brought it to the brook, and the brook gave him water. ",1022,1215
11,"So then the cock brought the water to the hen, but alas, it was too late; ",1215,1289
12," the hen had choked in the meanwhile, and lay there dead. ",1288,1346
13,"And the cock was so grieved that he cried aloud, and all the beasts came and lamented for the hen; ",1346,1445
14," and six mice built a little waggon, on which to carry the poor hen to her grave, and when it was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove. ",1444,1601
15,On the way they met the fox. ,1601,1630
16,"""Halloa, cock,"" cried he, ""where are you off to?"" ",1630,1680
17,"""To bury my hen,"" answered the cock. ",1680,1717
18,"""Can I come too?"" ",1717,1735
19,said the fox. ,1735,1749
20,"""Yes, if you follow behind,"" said the cock. ",1749,1793
21,"So the fox followed behind and he was soon joined by the wolf, the bear, the stag, the lion, and all the beasts in the wood. ",1793,1918
22,And the procession went on till they came to a brook. ,1918,1972
23,"""How shall we get over?"" ",1972,1997
24,said the cock. ,1778,1793
25,"Now in the brook there was a straw, and he said, ""I will lay myself across, so that you may pass over on me."" ",2012,2122
26,"But when the six mice had got upon this bridge, the straw slipped and fell into the water and they all tumbled in and were drowned. ",2122,2254
27,"So they were as badly off as ever, when a coal came up and said he would lay himself across and they might pass over him; ",2254,2376
28," but no sooner had he touched the water than he hissed, went out, and was dead. ",2375,2455
29,"A stone seeing this was touched with pity, and, wishing to help the cock, he laid himself across the stream. ",2455,2564
30,"And the cock drew the waggon with the dead hen in it safely to the other side, and then began to draw the others who followed behind across too, but it was too much for him, the waggon turned over, and all tumbled into the water one on the top of another, and were drowned. ",2564,2838
31,"So the cock was left all alone with the dead hen, and he digged a grave and laid her in it, and he raised a mound above her, and sat himself down and lamented so sore that at last he died. ",2838,3027
32,And so they were all dead together.,3027,3063
