0,Once upon a time there was a couple who had an only son named Halvor. ,0,70
1,"While he was still but a little lad, he would do nothing at all; ",70,135
2," but was always sitting at the hearth, digging in the ashes. ",134,195
3,"His parents apprenticed him here and apprenticed him there, to be taught something, but Halvor never stayed. ",195,304
4,"When he had been anywhere for a few days, he ran away again, went back home, sat down at the hearth, and dug in the ashes. ",304,427
5,"But once a master mariner came along and asked whether Halvor would not like to go with him, and sail the seas, and see foreign lands. ",427,562
6,"Indeed, Halvor would like to do so very much, and it did not take him long to make up his mind. ",562,658
7,"How long they sailed the seas I do not know, but suddenly a powerful storm arose, and when it had passed, and all had grown quiet once more, they did not know where they were. ",658,834
8,"They had been driven off their course to a foreign shore, which none among them recognized. ",834,926
9,"And then, since not a breeze was stirring, they lay there, and Halvor begged the master mariner for permission to go ashore, and look around, for he would rather do that than lie down and sleep. ",926,1121
10,"""Do you think you are fit to appear before people?"" ",1121,1173
11,asked the master mariner. ,1173,1199
12,"""The only clothes you have are the rags in which you stand and walk!"" ",1199,1269
13,"Yet Halvor insisted, and finally he was given permission. ",1269,1327
14,But he was to come back when the wind blew up. ,1327,1374
15,"Halvor went, and it was a fair land. ",1374,1411
16,"No matter where he came, there were great plains, with fields and pastures; ",1411,1487
17, but he saw no people at all. ,1486,1516
18,"The wind blew up again, but Halvor decided that he had not yet seen enough, and wanted to go a little further, and see whether there were no people to be found at all. ",1516,1684
19,"After a time he came to a great highway, which was so even one could have rolled an egg along it with ease. ",1684,1792
20,"Halvor went on along this highway, and as evening drew near, he saw a great castle in the distance, that shone afar. ",1792,1909
21,"Since he had been wandering all day long, without much in the way of food, he had a fine appetite; ",1909,2008
22," but the nearer he came to the castle, the more frightened he grew. ",2007,2075
23,"In the castle there was a fire on the hearth, and Halvor went into the kitchen, which was beautiful. ",2075,2176
24,The kitchenware was all of silver and gold; ,2176,2220
25, but there were no human beings to be seen. ,2219,2263
26,"After Halvor had waited a while, and no one came out, he went and opened a door. ",2263,2344
27,There he saw a princess sitting and spinning. ,2344,2390
28,"""Alas, no!"" ",2390,2402
29,cried she. ,2402,2413
30,"""Has a Christian soul really come here! ",2413,2453
31,"But it would be best for you to go again, if you do not want the troll to swallow you; ",2453,2540
32," for a troll with three heads lives here."" ",2539,2582
33,"""And though he had four, I should like to see him,"" said the youth. ",2582,2650
34,"""And I am not going away, for I have done no wrong. ",2650,2702
35,"But you must give me something to eat, for I am terribly hungry."" ",2702,2768
36,"When Halvor had eaten his fill, the princess told him to try and see whether he could swing the sword that hung on the wall. ",2768,2893
37,"But he could not swing it, nor even raise it. ",2893,2939
38,"""Well,"" said the princess, ""you must take a swallow from the bottle that hangs beside it, for that is what the troll does when he wants to use the sword."" ",2939,3094
39,"Halvor took the swallow, and then could swing the sword at once as though it were nothing at all. ",3094,3192
40,"Now, thought he, the troll could just come along any time. ",3192,3251
41,"And sure enough, he did come along, roaring. ",3251,3296
42,Halvor placed himself behind the door. ,3296,3335
43,"""Hu! ",3335,3340
44,"it smells like Christian blood here!"" ",3340,3378
45,"said the troll, and poked his head in through the door. ",3378,3434
46,"""Yes, you shall find out it is here and at once,"" cried Halvor, and hewed off all his heads. ",3434,3527
47,"The princess was filled with joy at her deliverance, and danced and sang. ",3527,3601
48,"But then she happened to think of her sisters, and said: ""If only my sisters could also be delivered!"" ",3601,3704
49,"""Where are they?"" ",3704,3722
50,asked Halvor. ,3722,3736
51,"So she told him that one of them had been carried off by a troll to a castle six miles further away, and the other to a castle that lay nine miles away from the other. ",3736,3904
52,"""But now,"" said she, ""you must first help me get this body out."" ",3904,3969
53,"Halvor was very strong, so he quickly cleared everything out, cleaned up, and put all in order. ",3969,4065
54,"Then they ate, and the following morning he started off at dawn. ",4065,4130
55,"He did not rest for a moment, but wandered all day long. ",4130,4187
56,"When he spied the castle, he once more felt a little afraid; ",4187,4248
57, it was even handsomer than the other one; ,4247,4290
58," but here, too, there was not a human being to be seen. ",4289,4345
59,"Then Halvor went into the kitchen, yet did not stop at all, but stepped right into the next room. ",4345,4443
60,"""No, it cannot be possible that a Christian should venture here!"" ",4443,4509
61,cried the princess. ,4509,4529
62,"""I do not know how long I have been here; ",4529,4571
63, but during all that time I have not seen a single Christian soul. ,4570,4637
64,It would probably be best if you went away quickly; ,4637,4689
65," for a troll with six heads lives here."" ",4688,4729
66,"""No, I am not going,"" said Halvor, ""not even if he had six heads more."" ",4729,4801
67,"""He will seize you and swallow you alive!"" ",4801,4844
68,said the princess. ,4844,4863
69,"But that made no difference, Halvor would not go, and he did not fear the troll. ",4863,4944
70,"But he would have to eat and drink, for he was hungry and thirsty after his long tramp. ",4944,5032
71,He had as much as he wanted; ,5032,5061
72, and then the princess wanted to send him away again. ,5060,5114
73,"""No,"" cried Halvor, ""I am not going. ",5114,5151
74,"I have done no wrong, and need not fear any one."" ",5151,5201
75,"""That will not worry the troll,"" said the princess. ",5201,5253
76,"""He will seize you without any questions asked. ",5253,5301
77,"Yet, if you positively will not go, why, try and see whether you can swing the sword that the troll uses in war."" ",5301,5415
78,He could not swing it; ,5415,5438
79," but then the princess told him to take a swallow from the bottle that hung beside it, and when he had done so he could swing the sword. ",5437,5574
80,"Suddenly the troll came, and he was so large and so fat that he had to move sideways in order to get through the door. ",5574,5693
81,"When he had thrust in his first head, he cried: ""Huhu! ",5693,5748
82,"I smell the blood of a Christian!"" ",5748,5783
83,"And that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and then all the rest. ",5783,5860
84,The princess was pleased beyond measure; ,5860,5901
85," but then she happened to think of her sisters, and she wished that they also might be delivered. ",5900,5998
86,"Halvor thought this might be done, and wanted to start out at once. ",5998,6066
87,"But first he had to help the princess get the dead troll out of the way and then, the following morning, he set out. ",6066,6183
88,"It was a long way to the castle, and he hurried and ran in order to get there in good time. ",6183,6275
89,"Toward evening he spied the castle, and it was much handsomer than both the others. ",6275,6359
90,This time he felt hardly any fear at all; ,6359,6401
91, but went through the kitchen and right on in. ,6400,6447
92,There sat a princess who was extraordinarily beautiful. ,6447,6503
93,"Like the others, she said that no Christian soul had ever come to the castle since she had been there, and told him to go away again, as otherwise the troll would swallow him alive, for he had nine heads. ",6503,6708
94,"""And though he had nine more, and nine on top of those, I will not go,"" said Halvor, and stood by the stove. ",6708,6817
95,"The princess earnestly begged him to go, so that the troll would not devour him, but Halvor said: ""Let him come whenever he wishes!"" ",6817,6950
96,"Then she gave him the troll sword, and told him to take a swallow from the bottle, so that he could swing it. ",6950,7060
97,Suddenly the troll came roaring along. ,7060,7099
98,"He was even larger and more powerful than both the others, and he also had to squeeze himself in at the door sideways. ",7099,7218
99,"""Hu! ",3335,3340
100,"I smell the blood of a Christian!"" ",5748,5783
101,"That very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and then all of the others; ",7258,7336
102," but the last clung to life most toughly, and it cost Halvor a good deal of trouble to cut it off, though he found himself so very strong. ",7335,7474
103,"Now all the princesses met at the castle, and were happy as they never had been before, in all their lives, and they fell in love with Halvor and he with them, and he was to choose the one whom he loved best; ",7474,7683
104, but it was the youngest who loved him the most of all. ,7682,7738
105,"Yet Halvor acted strangely, and grew quite silent and uncommunicative; ",7738,7809
106," so the princess asked him what he was longing for, and whether he did not enjoy being with them. ",7808,7906
107,"Yes, he enjoyed it very much, for they had enough to live on, and he was well enough off, but yet he was homesick, for his parents were still living, and he would like to see them again. ",7906,8093
108,"That could easily be arranged, said the princess. ",8093,8143
109,"""You shall go and return without harm, if you will follow our advice."" ",8143,8214
110,"Indeed, and he would surely do nothing against their wishes, said Halvor. ",8214,8288
111,"Then they dressed him up until he looked as handsome as a king's son, and put a ring on his finger that made it possible for the one wearing it to wish himself away, and back again. ",8288,8470
112,"But he must not throw the ring away, and he must not mention their names, said the princesses, otherwise its power would be gone, all their joy would come to an end, and he would never see them again. ",8470,8671
113,"""I wish I might be back at the house at home!"" ",8671,8718
114,"said Halvor, and his wish was at once realized, and he was standing in front of his parents' house before he knew it. ",8718,8836
115,"It was dusk, and when the old folk saw such a handsome, well-dressed stranger coming, it embarrassed them so that it seemed as though their bowing and scraping would never end. ",8836,9013
116,Halvor now asked them whether they could not give him a night's lodging. ,9013,9086
117,"""No, they really could not do so, for they were quite unprepared for it,"" said they, ""and we are lacking one thing, and another, which such a distinguished gentleman would wish to have. ",9086,9272
118,"It would be best if the gentleman went up to the castle, whose chimney he can see from here, where the folk are well prepared."" ",9272,9400
119,"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I'll not go there until to-morrow morning. ",9400,9463
120,And now let me stay here overnight. ,9463,9499
121,"I will be content to sit by the hearth."" ",9499,9540
122,"The old folk could make no objection to this, and so Halvor sat down by the hearth, and began to dig in the ashes, as he used to when he was the lazybones at home. ",9540,9704
123,"Then they chatted about all sorts of matters, and told Halvor about one thing and another, and finally he asked them whether they had no children. ",9704,9851
124,"Yes, they had a son; ",9851,9872
125," but did not know whither he had wandered, or even whether he were still alive, or already dead. ",9871,9968
126,"""Could I not be this Halvor?"" ",9968,9998
127,said Halvor. ,8275,8288
128,"""No, I am quite sure you could not,"" said the woman, starting up. ",10011,10077
129,"""Halvor was so slow and lazy, and never wanted to do anything, and beside, he was so tattered that one rag got in the way of the other. ",10077,10213
130,"He could never have turned into so fine a looking gentleman as yourself."" ",10213,10287
131,"After a time the woman had to go to the hearth, and rake the fire, and as the firelight fell on Halvor, just as it used to when he dug in the ashes, she recognized him. ",10287,10456
132,"""No, can it really be you, Halvor?"" ",10456,10492
133,"she cried, and then the two old folk were happy beyond all power of words, and Halvor had to tell all that had happened to him, while his mother was so pleased with him, that she wanted to take him up to the castle at once, and show him to the girls who had always been so proud, and had turned up their noses at her son. ",10492,10814
134,So she went first and Halvor followed. ,10814,10853
135,"When they came up, she told how Halvor had come back, and that they ought to see how fine he looked, just like a prince, said she. ",10853,10984
136,"""We can imagine that,"" said the girls, and tossed their heads. ",10984,11047
137,"""He is probably the same ragged fellow that he used to be."" ",11047,11107
138,"At that moment Halvor stepped in, and then the girls were so embarrassed that they ran out of the house without their caps. ",11107,11231
139,"And when they came in again, they were so ashamed that they did not venture to look at Halvor, whom they had always treated with such scorn and contempt. ",11231,11385
140,"""Well, you always acted as though you were so fine and handsome that no one on earth could compare with you. ",11385,11494
141,"But you ought to see the oldest princess, whom I delivered,"" said Halvor. ",11494,11568
142,"""Compared to her you look like dairy-maids, and the middle princess is still handsomer; ",11568,11656
143," while the youngest princess, who is my sweetheart, is more beautiful than the sun and moon. ",11655,11748
144,"Would to God she were here, so that you might see her!"" ",11748,11804
145,said Halvor. ,8275,8288
146,No sooner had he finished speaking than there they stood; ,11817,11875
147," but then he was very much upset, for now he remembered what they had told him. ",11874,11954
148,"At the castle they gave a great feast in honor of the princesses, and made a great deal of them. ",11954,12051
149,But they would not stay. ,12051,12076
150,"""We want to go to your parents,"" they said to Halvor, ""and then we want to go out and look around."" ",12076,12176
151,"He went with them, and they came to a big sheet of water beyond the court-yard. ",12176,12256
152,"Close beside it was a fair green hill, and there the princesses decided to sit and rest a while, ""for it was so pleasant to look out over the water,"" said they. ",12256,12417
153,"They sat down, and after they had rested a while, the youngest princess said: ""Let me stroke your hair a little, Halvor!"" ",12417,12539
154,"Halvor laid his head in her lap, and she stroked his hair, and before very long Halvor fell asleep. ",12539,12639
155,"Then she drew the ring from his finger, and gave him another in place of it, and said: ""All hold on to me--I wish we were in Soria-Moria Castle!"" ",12639,12785
156,"When Halvor woke up he saw very well that he had lost the princesses, and began to weep and wail, and was so beside himself with despair that no one could comfort him. ",12785,12953
157,"And no matter how hard his parents begged him, he would not stay at home, but bade them farewell, and said that he would probably never see them again, for if he did not find his princesses, then it would not be worth his while to go on living. ",12953,13198
158,"He still had three hundred dollars, and these he put in his pocket and started out. ",13198,13282
159,After he had gone a while he met a man with a nice-looking horse. ,13282,13348
160,"He decided to buy it, and began to talk with the man. ",13348,13402
161,"""It is true I did not intend to sell the horse,"" said the man, ""but perhaps we can come to an understanding."" ",13402,13512
162,Halvor asked him what he wanted for it. ,13512,13552
163,"""I did not pay much for it, nor is it worth very much: it is a good saddle horse, but as a draft horse it does not amount to much. ",13552,13683
164,"Yet it could carry you and your knapsack without difficulty, if you were to walk a bit from time to time,"" said the man. ",13683,13804
165,"At last they agreed on the price, and Halvor slung his knapsack across the horse, and from time to time he walked, and then he rode again. ",13804,13943
166,"Toward evening he came to a green hill on which stood a large tree, beneath which he seated himself. ",13943,14044
167,"He turned the horse loose, yet did not lie down to sleep, but took out his knapsack instead. ",14044,14137
168,"When day came he wandered on again, for it seemed to him as though there were no place in which he could rest. ",14137,14248
169,"He walked and rode all day long through a great forest, in which were many green clearings, that shimmered cheerfully among the trees. ",14248,14383
170,"He did not know where he was, nor did he know whither he was going; ",14383,14451
171," but he allowed himself no more time to rest than his horse needed to feed in one of the green clearings, and himself to eat from his knapsack. ",14450,14594
172,"He walked and rode, on and on, and thought the forest would never end. ",14594,14665
173,But on the evening of the following day he saw something gleaming among the trees. ,14665,14748
174,"""If the people there are still up, I could warm myself a little, and get something to eat!"" ",14748,14840
175,thought Halvor. ,14840,14856
176,"When he got there it was a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old couple sitting in it, as ancient and gray-headed as doves, and the woman had so long a nose that she used it at the hearth for a poker. ",14856,15077
177,"""Good evening! ",15077,15092
178,"Good evening!"" ",15092,15107
179,said the old woman. ,15107,15127
180,"""But what are you doing here? ",15127,15157
181,"No Christian soul has come this way for the past hundred years."" ",15157,15222
182,"Halvor told her he was looking for Soria-Moria Castle, and asked whether she knew the way to it. ",15222,15319
183,"""No,"" was the woman's answer, ""I do not know, but here comes the moon, I will ask him. ",15319,15406
184,"He ought to know, for he shines on everything."" ",15406,15454
185,"And then, when the moon rose bright and clear above the tree-tops, the woman went out. ",15454,15541
186,"""You moon, you moon,"" she cried, ""can you tell me the way to Soria-Moria Castle?"" ",15541,15623
187,"""No,"" said the moon, ""I cannot do that, because when I was shining there, a cloud lay in my way."" ",15623,15721
188,"""Just wait a little while,"" said the old woman to Halvor. ",15721,15779
189,"""The West Wind will be right along, and he is sure to know, for he sweeps and blows about in every corner. ",15779,15886
190,"Well, I declare, you have a horse, too!"" ",15886,15927
191,said the old woman when she came in again. ,15927,15970
192,"""Now don't let the poor beast stand by the door there and starve to death; ",15970,16045
193, but take it out to the pasture instead. ,16044,16085
194,Or would you like to change with me? ,16085,16122
195,"We have a pair of old boots, that carry you twelve miles further with every step. ",16122,16204
196,"I will give them to you in exchange for the horse, and then you will reach Soria-Moria Castle more quickly."" ",16204,16313
197,"Halvor at once agreed, and the old woman was so pleased with the horse, that she almost started dancing then and there. ",16313,16433
198,"""For now I can ride to church, too,"" said she. ",16433,16480
199,"Halvor was very restless, and wanted to go right on again, but the woman said there was no need to hurry. ",16480,16586
200,"""Lie down on the bench by the stove, and take a nap, for we have no bed for you,"" said she. ",16586,16678
201,"""I will watch for the West Wind's coming."" ",16678,16721
202,All of a sudden the West Wind came rushing along so that the walls creaked. ,16721,16797
203,"The woman ran out: ""You West Wind! ",16797,16832
204,You West Wind! ,16817,16832
205,Can you tell me the way to Soria-Moria Castle? ,16847,16894
206,"There is a fellow here who wants to know."" ",16894,16937
207,"""Yes, indeed,"" said the West Wind, ""I have to go to that very place, and dry the wash for the wedding soon to be held. ",16937,17056
208,"If he is quick afoot, he may come along with me."" ",17056,17106
209,Halvor ran out. ,17106,17122
210,"""You must hurry if you are going with me,"" said the West Wind; ",17122,17185
211," and at once he was up and off over hill and dale, land and sea, so that Halvor could hardly keep up with him. ",17184,17295
212,"""Now I have no more time to keep you company,"" said the West Wind, ""because I have first to tear down a stretch of pine forest, before I come to the bleaching-field and dry the wash. ",17295,17478
213,"But if you keep going along the hills, you will meet some girls standing there and washing, and then you will not be far from Soria-Moria Castle."" ",17478,17625
214,"After a time Halvor came to the girls who were washing, and they asked him whether he had seen anything of the West Wind, who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding. ",17625,17800
215,"""Yes,"" said Halvor. ",17800,17820
216,"""He is only tearing down a stretch of pine forest, and will soon be here,"" and then he asked the way to Soria-Moria Castle. ",17820,17944
