0,'How astonishingly cold it is! ,0,31
1,My body is cracking all over!' ,31,62
2,said the Snow-man. ,62,81
3,'The wind is really cutting one's very life out! ,81,130
4,And how that fiery thing up there glares!' ,130,173
5,"He meant the sun, which was just setting. ",173,215
6,"'It sha'n't make me blink, though, and I shall keep quite cool and collected.' ",215,294
7,Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head; ,294,371
8," his mouth consisted of an old rake, so that he had teeth as well. ",370,437
9,"He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys, and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges. ",437,562
10,"The sun went down, the full moon rose, large, round, clear and beautiful, in the dark blue sky. ",562,658
11,'There it is again on the other side!' ,658,697
12,"said the Snow-man, by which he meant the sun was appearing again. ",697,763
13,'I have become quite accustomed to its glaring. ,763,811
14,"I hope it will hang there and shine, so that I may be able to see myself. ",811,885
15,"I wish I knew, though, how one ought to see about changing one's position. ",885,960
16,I should very much like to move about. ,960,999
17,"If I only could, I would glide up and down the ice there, as I saw the boys doing; ",999,1082
18," but somehow or other, I don't know how to run.' ",1081,1130
19,'Bow-wow!' ,1130,1141
20,barked the old yard-dog; ,1141,1166
21, he was rather hoarse and couldn't bark very well. ,1165,1216
22,His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove. ,1216,1302
23,'The sun will soon teach you to run! ,1302,1339
24,"I saw that last winter with your predecessor, and farther back still with his predecessors! ",1339,1431
25,They have all run away!' ,1431,1456
26,"'I don't understand you, my friend,' said the Snow-man. ",1456,1512
27,'That thing up there is to teach me to run?' ,1512,1557
28,He meant the moon. ,1557,1576
29,"'Well, it certainly did run just now, for I saw it quite plainly over there, and now here it is on this side.' ",1576,1687
30,"'You know nothing at all about it,' said the yard-dog. ",1687,1742
31,"'Why, you have only just been made. ",1742,1778
32,The thing you see there is the moon; ,1778,1815
33, the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun. ,1814,1878
34,"He will come up again tomorrow morning, and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter. ",1878,1975
35,The weather is going to change; ,1975,2007
36, I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg; ,2006,2058
37, the weather is certainly going to change.' ,2057,2101
38,"'I can't understand him,' said the Snow-man; ",2101,2146
39, 'but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant. ,2145,2211
40,"That thing that glares so, and then disappears, the sun, as he calls it, is not my friend. ",2211,2302
41,I know that by instinct.' ,2302,2328
42,'Bow-wow!' ,1130,1141
43,"barked the yard-dog, and walked three times round himself, and then crept into his kennel to sleep. ",2339,2439
44,The weather really did change. ,2439,2470
45,Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood; ,2470,2537
46," later on came an icy wind, which sent the frost packing. ",2536,2594
47,"But when the sun rose, it was a glorious sight. ",2594,2642
48,"The trees and shrubs were covered with rime, and looked like a wood of coral, and every branch was thick with long white blossoms. ",2642,2773
49,"The most delicate twigs, which are lost among the foliage in summer-time, came now into prominence, and it was like a spider's web of glistening white. ",2773,2925
50,The lady-birches waved in the wind; ,2925,2961
51," and when the sun shone, everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust, and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet. ",2960,3113
52,'Isn't it wonderful?' ,3113,3135
53,exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden. ,3135,3200
54,"They stopped near the Snow-man, and looked at the glistening trees. ",3200,3268
55,"'Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,' she said, with her eyes shining. ",3268,3346
56,"'And one can't get a fellow like this in summer either,' said the young man, pointing to the Snow-man. ",3346,3449
57,'He's a beauty!' ,3449,3466
58,"The girl laughed, and nodded to the Snow-man, and then they both danced away over the snow. ",3466,3558
59,'Who were those two?' ,3558,3580
60,asked the Snow-man of the yard-dog. ,3580,3616
61,'You have been in this yard longer than I have. ,3616,3664
62,Do you know who they are?' ,3664,3691
63,'Do I know them indeed?' ,3691,3716
64,answered the yard-dog. ,3716,3739
65,"'She has often stroked me, and he has given me bones. ",3739,3793
66,I don't bite either of them!' ,3793,3823
67,'But what are they?' ,3823,3844
68,asked the Snow-man. ,3844,3864
69,'Lovers!' ,3864,3874
70,replied the yard-dog. ,3874,3896
71,'They will go into one kennel and gnaw the same bone!' ,3896,3951
72,'Are they the same kind of beings that we are?' ,3951,3999
73,asked the Snow-man. ,3844,3864
74,"'They are our masters,' answered the yard-dog. ",4019,4066
75,'Really people who have only been in the world one day know very little. ,4066,4139
76,That's the conclusion I have come to. ,4139,4177
77,Now I have age and wisdom; ,4177,4204
78," I know everyone in the house, and I can remember a time when I was not lying here in a cold kennel. ",4203,4304
79,Bow-wow!' ,1131,1141
80,"'The cold is splendid,' said the Snow-man. ",4314,4357
81,'Tell me some more. ,4357,4377
82,"But don't rattle your chain so, it makes me crack!' ",4377,4429
83,'Bow-wow!' ,1130,1141
84,barked the yard-dog. ,4440,4461
85,'They used to say I was a pretty little fellow; ,4461,4509
86, then I lay in a velvet-covered chair in my master's house. ,4508,4568
87,"My mistress used to nurse me, and kiss and fondle me, and call me her dear, sweet little Alice! ",4568,4664
88,"But by-and-by I grew too big, and I was given to the housekeeper, and I went into the kitchen. ",4664,4759
89,You can see into it from where you are standing; ,4759,4808
90," you can look at the room in which I was master, for so I was when I was with the housekeeper. ",4807,4902
91,"Of course it was a smaller place than upstairs, but it was more comfortable, for I wasn't chased about and teased by the children as I had been before. ",4902,5054
92,"My food was just as good, or even better. ",5054,5096
93,"I had my own pillow, and there was a stove there, which at this time of year is the most beautiful thing in the world. ",5096,5215
94,I used to creep right under that stove. ,5215,5255
95,Ah me! ,5255,5262
96,I often dream of that stove still! ,5262,5297
97,Bow-wow!' ,1131,1141
98,'Is a stove so beautiful?' ,5307,5334
99,asked the Snow-man. ,3844,3864
100,'Is it anything like me?' ,5354,5380
101,'It is just the opposite of you! ,5380,5413
102,"It is coal-black, and has a long neck with a brass pipe. ",5413,5470
103,"It eats firewood, so that fire spouts out of its mouth. ",5470,5526
104,One has to keep close beside it-quite underneath is the nicest of all. ,5526,5597
105,You can see it through the window from where you are standing.' ,5597,5661
106,"And the Snow-man looked in that direction, and saw a smooth polished object with a brass pipe. ",5661,5756
107,The flicker from the fire reached him across the snow. ,5756,5811
108,"The Snow-man felt wonderfully happy, and a feeling came over him which he could not express; ",5811,5904
109, but all those who are not snow-men know about it. ,5903,5954
110,'Why did you leave her?' ,5954,5979
111,asked the Snow-man. ,3844,3864
112,He had a feeling that such a being must be a lady. ,5999,6050
113,'How could you leave such a place?' ,6050,6086
114,'I had to!' ,6086,6098
115,said the yard-dog. ,1723,1742
116,"'They turned me out of doors, and chained me up here. ",6117,6171
117,"I had bitten the youngest boy in the leg, because he took away the bone I was gnawing; ",6171,6258
118," a bone for a bone, I thought! ",6257,6288
119,"But they were very angry, and from that time I have been chained here, and I have lost my voice. ",6288,6385
120,Don't you hear how hoarse I am? ,6385,6417
121,Bow-wow!',1131,1140
122,I can't speak like other dogs. ,6426,6457
123,Bow-wow!',1131,1140
124,That was the end of happiness!' ,6466,6498
125,"The Snow-man, however, was not listening to him any more; ",6498,6556
126," he was looking into the room where the housekeeper lived, where the stove stood on its four iron legs, and seemed to be just the same size as the Snow-man. ",6555,6712
127,'How something is cracking inside me!' ,6712,6751
128,he said. ,6751,6760
129,'Shall I never be able to get in there? ,6760,6800
130,"It is certainly a very innocent wish, and our innocent wishes ought to be fulfilled. ",6800,6885
131,"I must get there, and lean against the stove, if I have to break the window first!' ",6885,6969
132,'You will never get inside there!' ,6969,7004
133,said the yard-dog; ,7004,7023
134, 'and if you were to reach the stove you would disappear. ,7022,7080
135,Bow-wow!' ,1131,1141
136,'I'm as good as gone already!' ,7090,7121
137,answered the Snow-man. ,7121,7144
138,'I believe I'm breaking up!' ,7144,7173
139,The whole day the Snow-man looked through the window; ,7173,7227
140, towards dusk the room grew still more inviting; ,7226,7275
141," the stove gave out a mild light, not at all like the moon or even the sun; ",7274,7350
142," no, as only a stove can shine, when it has something to feed upon. ",7349,7417
143,"When the door of the room was open, it flared up-this was one of its peculiarities; ",7417,7501
144, it flickered quite red upon the Snow-man's white face. ,7500,7556
145,'I can't stand it any longer!' ,7556,7587
146,he said. ,6751,6760
147,'How beautiful it looks with its tongue stretched out like that!' ,7596,7662
148,"It was a long night, but the Snow-man did not find it so; ",7662,7720
149," there he stood, wrapt in his pleasant thoughts, and they froze, so that he cracked. ",7719,7804
150,"Next morning the panes of the kitchen window were covered with ice, and the most beautiful ice-flowers that even a snow-man could desire, only they blotted out the stove. ",7804,7975
151,The window would not open; ,7975,8002
152, he couldn't see the stove which he thought was such a lovely lady. ,8001,8069
153,There was a cracking and cracking inside him and all around; ,8069,8130
154, there was just such a frost as a snow-man would delight in. ,8129,8190
155,But this Snow-man was different: how could he feel happy? ,8190,8248
156,'Yours is a bad illness for a Snow-man!' ,8248,8289
157,said the yard-dog. ,1723,1742
158,"'I also suffered from it, but I have got over it. ",8308,8358
159,Bow-wow!' ,1131,1141
160,he barked. ,8368,8379
161,'The weather is going to change!' ,8379,8413
162,he added. ,8413,8423
163,The weather did change. ,8423,8447
164,There came a thaw. ,8447,8466
165,When this set in the Snow-man set off. ,8466,8505
166,"He did not say anything, and he did not complain, and those are bad signs. ",8505,8580
167,One morning he broke up altogether. ,8580,8616
168,And lo! ,8616,8624
169,"where he had stood there remained a broomstick standing upright, round which the boys had built him! ",8624,8725
170,'Ah! ,8725,8730
171,"now I understand why he loved the stove,' said the yard-dog. ",8730,8791
172,'That is the raker they use to clean out the stove! ,8791,8843
173,The Snow-man had a stove-raker in his body! ,8843,8887
174,That's what was the matter with him! ,8887,8924
175,And now it's all over with him! ,8924,8956
176,Bow-wow!' ,1131,1141
177,And before long it was all over with the winter too! ,8966,9019
178,'Bow-wow!' ,1130,1141
179,barked the hoarse yard-dog. ,9030,9058
180,"But the young girl sang: Woods, your bright green garments don! ",9058,9122
181,"Willows, your woolly gloves put on! ",9122,9158
182,"Lark and cuckoo, daily sing- February has brought the spring! ",9158,9220
183,My heart joins in your song so sweet; ,9220,9258
184," Come out, dear sun, the world to greet! ",9257,9298
185,And no one thought of the Snow-man.,9298,9334
