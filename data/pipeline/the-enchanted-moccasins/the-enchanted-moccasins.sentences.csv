0,"A long, long time ago, a little boy was living with his sister entirely alone in an uninhabited country, far out in the north-west. ",0,132
1,"He was called the Boy that carries the Ball on his Back, from an idea that he possessed supernatural powers. ",132,241
2,"This boy was in the habit of meditating alone, and asking within himself, whether there were other beings similar to themselves on the earth. ",241,383
3,"When he grew up to manhood, he inquired of his sister whether she knew of any human beings beside themselves. ",383,493
4,She replied that she did; ,493,519
5," and that there was, at a great distance, a large village. ",518,577
6,"As soon as he heard this, he said to his sister, ""I am now a young man and very much in want of a companion;""",577,686
7,""" and he asked his sister to make him several pairs of moccasins. ",685,751
8,She complied with his request; ,751,782
9," and as soon as he received the moccasins, he took up his war-club and set out in quest of the distant village. ",781,893
10,"He traveled on till he came to a small wigwam, and on looking into it he discovered a very old woman sitting alone by the fire. ",893,1021
11,"As soon as she saw the stranger, she invited him in, and thus addressed him: ""My poor grandchild, I suppose you are one of those who seek for the distant village, from which no person has ever yet returned. ",1021,1228
12,"Unless your guardian is more powerful than the guardians of those who have gone before you, you will share a similar fate to theirs. ",1228,1361
13,"Be careful to provide yourself with the invisible bones they use in the medicine-dance, for without these you can not succeed."" ",1361,1489
14,"After she had thus spoken, she gave him the following directions for his journey: ""When you come near to the village which you seek, you will see in the center a large lodge, in which the chief of the village, who has two daughters, resides. ",1489,1731
15,"Before the door there is a great tree, which is smooth and without bark. ",1731,1804
16,"On this tree, about the height of a man from the ground, is hung a small lodge, in which these two false daughters dwell. ",1804,1926
17,"It is here that so many have been destroyed, and among them your two elder brothers. ",1926,2011
18,"Be wise, my grandchild, and abide strictly by my directions."" ",2011,2073
19,The old woman then gave to the young man the bones which were to secure his success; ,2073,2158
20, and she informed him with great care how he was to proceed. ,2157,2218
21,"Placing them in his bosom, Onwee Bahmondang, or the Wearer of the Ball, continued his journey, and kept eagerly on until he arrived at the village of which he was in search; ",2218,2392
22," and as he was gazing around him, he saw both the tree and the lodge which the old woman had mentioned. ",2391,2495
23,"He at once bent his steps for the tree, and approaching, he endeavored to reach the suspended lodge. ",2495,2596
24,But all his efforts were in vain; ,2596,2630
25," for as often as he attempted to reach it, the tree began to tremble, and it soon shot up so that the lodge could hardly be perceived. ",2629,2764
26,"He bethought him of his guardian, and invoking his aid, and changing himself into a squirrel, he mounted nimbly up again, in the hope that the lodge would not now escape him. ",2764,2939
27,"Away shot the lodge, climb as briskly as he might. ",2939,2990
28,"Panting, and out of breath, he remembered the instructions of the old woman, and drawing from his bosom one of the bones, he thrust it into the trunk of the tree, and rested himself to be ready to start again. ",2990,3200
29,"As often as he wearied of climbing, for even a squirrel can not climb forever, he repeated the little ceremony of the bones; ",3200,3325
30," but whenever he came near the lodge and put forth his hand to touch it, the tree would shoot up as before, and carry the lodge up far beyond his reach. ",3324,3477
31,"At length the bones being all gone, and the lodge well-nigh out of sight, he began to despair, for the earth, too, had long since vanished entirely from his view. ",3477,3640
32,"Summoning his whole heart, he resolved to try once more. ",3640,3697
33,"On and up he went, and, as soon as he put forth his hand to touch it, the tree again shook, and away went the lodge. ",3697,3814
34,"One more endeavor, brave Onwee, and in he goes; ",3814,3862
35," for having now reached the arch of heaven, the fly-away lodge could go no higher. ",3861,3944
36,"Onwee entered the lodge with a fearless step, and he beheld the two wicked sisters sitting opposite each other. ",3944,4056
37,He asked their names. ,4056,4078
38,"The one on his left hand called herself Azhabee, and the one on the right, Negahnabee. ",4078,4165
39,"After talking with them a little while, he discovered that whenever he addressed the one on his left hand, the tree would tremble as before and settle down to its former place; ",4165,4342
40," but when he addressed the one on his right hand, it would again shoot upward. ",4341,4420
41,"When he thus perceived that by addressing the one on his left hand that the tree would descend, he continued to do so until it had again settled down to its place near the earth. ",4420,4599
42,"Then seizing his war-club, he said to the sisters: ""You who have caused the death of so many of my brethren I will now put an end to, and thus have revenge for those you have destroyed."" ",4599,4786
43,"As he spoke this he raised the club, and with one blow laid the two wicked women dead at his feet. ",4786,4885
44,"Onwee then descended, and learning that these sisters had a brother living with their father, who had shared all together in the spoils of all such as the wicked sisters had betrayed, and who would now pursue him for having put an end to their wicked profits, Onwee set off at random, not knowing whither he went. ",4885,5199
45,"The father coming in the evening to visit the lodge of his daughters, discovered what had happened. ",5199,5299
46,"He immediately sent word to his son that his sisters had been slain, and that there were no more spoils to be had, which greatly inflamed the young man's temper, especially the woeful announcement at the close. ",5299,5510
47,"""The person who has done this,"" said the brother, as soon as he had reached the spot, chafing and half beside himself at the gloomy prospect of having no more travelers to strip, ""must be that boy who carries the ball on his back. ",5510,5741
48,"I know his mode of going about his business, and since he would not allow himself to be killed by my sisters, he shall have the honor of dying by my hand. ",5741,5896
49,"I will pursue him and have revenge."" ",5896,5933
50,"""It is well, my son,"" replied the father; ",5933,5975
51," ""the spirit of your life grant you success. ",5974,6019
52,I counsel you to be wary in the pursuit. ,6019,6060
53,Bahmondang is a cunning youth. ,6060,6091
54,"It is a strong spirit who has put him on to do this injury to us, and he will try to deceive you in every way. ",6091,6202
55,"Above all, avoid tasting food till you succeed; ",6202,6250
56," for if you break your fast before you see his blood, your power will be destroyed."" ",6249,6334
57,"The son took this fatherly advice all in good part, except that portion which enjoined upon him to abstain from staying his stomach; ",6334,6467
58," but over that he made a number of wry faces, for the brother of the two wicked sisters had, among numerous noble gifts, a very noble appetite. ",6466,6610
59,"Nevertheless, he took up his weapons and departed in pursuit of Onwee Bahmondang, at the top of his speed. ",6610,6717
60,"Onwee finding that he was closely followed, climbed up into one of the tallest trees, and shot forth the magic arrows with which he had provided himself. ",6717,6871
61,"Seeing that his pursuer was not turned back by his arrows, Onwee renewed his flight; ",6871,6956
62," and when he found himself hard pressed, and his enemy close behind him, he transformed himself into the skeleton of a moose that had been killed, whose flesh had come off from his bones. ",6955,7143
63,"He then remembered the moccasins which his sister had given him, and which were enchanted. ",7143,7234
64,"Taking a pair of them, he placed them near the skeleton. ",7234,7291
65,"""Go,"" said he to them, ""to the end of the earth."" ",7291,7341
66,"The moccasins then left him, and their tracks remained. ",7341,7397
67,"The angry brother at length came to the skeleton of the moose, when he perceived that the track he had been long pursuing did not stop there, so he continued to follow it up till he arrived at the end of the earth, where, for all his trouble, he found only a pair of moccasins. ",7397,7675
68,"Vexed that he had been outwitted by following a pair of moccasins instead of their owner, who was the object of his pursuit, he bitterly complained, resolving not to give up his revenge, and to be more wary in scrutinizing signs. ",7675,7905
69,"He then called to mind the skeleton he had met with on his way, and concluded that it must be the object of his search. ",7905,8025
70,"He retraced his steps toward the skeleton, but to his surprise it had disappeared, and the tracks of the wearer of the ball were in another direction. ",8025,8176
71,"He now became faint with hunger, and lost heart; ",8176,8225
72," but when he remembered the blood of his sisters, and that he should not be allowed to enjoy a meal, nor so much as a mouthful, until he had put an end to Onwee Bahmondang, he plucked up his spirits and determined again to pursue. ",8224,8455
73,"Onwee, finding that he was closely followed, and that the hungry brother was approaching very fast, changed himself into a very old man, with two daughters, and living in a large lodge in the center of a beautiful garden, which was filled with every thing that could delight the eye, or was pleasant to the taste. ",8455,8769
74,"He made himself appear so very old as to be unable to leave his lodge, and to require his daughters to bring him food and wait on him, as though he had been a mere child. ",8769,8940
75,"The garden also had the appearance of old age, with its ancient bushes and hanging branches and decrepit vines loitering lazily about in the sun. ",8940,9086
76,The brother kept on until he was nearly starved and ready to sink to the earth. ,9086,9166
77,"He exclaimed, with a long-drawn and most mournful sigh, ""Oh! ",9166,9227
78,"I will forget the blood of my sisters, for I am starving. ",9227,9285
79,Oh! ,9223,9227
80,"oh!"" ",9289,9294
81,"But again he thought of the blood of his sisters, and what a fine appetite he would have if he should ever be allowed to eat any thing again, and once more he resolved to pursue, and to be content with nothing short of the amplest revenge. ",9294,9534
82,He pushed on till he came to the beautiful garden. ,9534,9585
83,He advanced toward the lodge. ,9585,9615
84,As soon as the fairy daughters perceived him they ran and told their father that a stranger approached. ,9615,9719
85,"Their father replied, ""Invite him in, my children, invite him in."" ",9719,9786
86,"They did so promptly, and, by the command of their father, they boiled some corn, and prepared several other palatable dishes. ",9786,9913
87,"The savor was most delicious to the nostrils of the hungry brother, who had not the least suspicion of the sport that was going on at his expense. ",9913,10060
88,"He was faint and weary with travel, and he felt that he could endure fasting no longer; ",10060,10148
89, for his appetite was terribly inflamed by the sight of the choice food that was steaming before him. ,10147,10249
90,He fell to and partook heartily of the meal; ,10249,10294
91," and, by so doing, he was overcome, and lost his right of revenge. ",10293,10360
92,"All at once he forgot the blood of his sisters, and even the village of his nativity, and his father's lodge, and his whole past life. ",10360,10495
93,"He ate so keenly, and came and went to the choice dishes so often, that drowsiness at length overpowered him, and he soon fell into a profound sleep. ",10495,10645
94,"Onwee Bahmondang watched his opportunity, and as soon as he saw that the false brother's sleep was sound, he resumed his youthful form, and sent off the two fairy daughters and the old garden; ",10645,10838
95," and drawing the magic-ball from his back, which turned out to be a great war-club, he fetched the slumbering brother a mighty blow, which sent him away too; ",10837,10995
96, and thus did Onwee Bahmondang vindicate his title as the Wearer of the Ball. ,10994,11072
97,"When Onwee swung around, with the great force and weight of the club with which he had dispatched the brother of the two wicked women, he found himself in a large village, surrounded by a great crowd of people. ",11072,11283
98,"At the door of a beautiful lodge stood his sister, smiling, and ready to invite him in. ",11283,11371
99,"Onwee entered, and hanging up his war-club and the enchanted moccasins, which he had recovered, he rested from his labors, and smoked his evening pipe, with the admiration and approval of the whole world. ",11371,11576
100,"With one exception only, Onwee Bahmondang had the hearty praises of all the people. ",11576,11660
101,"Now it happened that there lived in this same village an envious and boastful fellow, who had been once a chief, but coming home always badly whipped, he was put out of office, and now spent his time about the place mainly, in proclaiming certain great things which he had in his eye, and which he meant to do-one of these days. ",11660,11989
102,"This man's name was Ko-ko, the Owl; ",11989,12025
103," and hearing much of the wonderful achievements of the Wearer of the Ball, Ko-ko put on a big look, and announced that he was going to do something extraordinary himself. ",12024,12195
104,"Onwee Bahmondang, he said, had not half done his work, and he, Ko-ko, meant to go on the ground and finish it up as it should be. ",12195,12325
105,"He began by procuring an oak ball, which he thrust down his back, and, confident in its magical powers, he, too, called himself the Wearer of the Ball. ",12325,12477
106,"In fact it was the self-same ball that Onwee had employed, except that the magic had entirely gone out of it. ",12477,12587
107,"Coming by night in the shadow of the lodge, he thrust his arm in at the door, and stealthily possessed himself of the enchanted moccasins. ",12587,12726
108,"He would have taken away Onwee's war-club too, if he could have carried it; ",12726,12802
109," but although he was twice the size and girth of Onwee, he had not the strength to lift it; ",12801,12893
110," so he borrowed a club from an old chief, who was purblind, and mistook Ko-ko for his brother who was a brave man; ",12892,13007
111," and raising a terrible tumult with his voice, and a great dust with his heels, Ko-ko set out. ",13006,13101
112,"He had traveled all day, when he came to a small wigwam, and on looking into it, he discovered a very old woman sitting alone by the fire; ",13101,13240
113, just as Onwee had before. ,13239,13266
114,"This is the wigwam, said Ko-ko, and this is the old woman. ",13266,13325
115,"""What are you looking for?"" ",13325,13353
116,asked the old woman. ,13353,13374
117,"""I want to find the lodge with the wicked young women in it, who slay travellers and steal their trappings,"" answered Ko-ko. ",13374,13499
118,"""You mean the two young women who lived in the flying lodge?"" ",13499,13561
119,said the old woman. ,13561,13581
120,"""The same,"" answered Ko-ko. ",13581,13609
121,"""I am going to kill them."" ",13609,13636
122,"With this he gave a great flourish with his borrowed club, and looked desperate and murderous as he could. ",13636,13743
123,"""They were slain yesterday by the Wearer of the Ball,"" said the old woman. ",13743,13818
124,"Ko-ko looked around for the door in a very owlish way, and heaving a short hem from his chest, he acknowledged that he had heard something to that effect down in one of the villages. ",13818,14001
125,"""But there's the brother. ",14001,14027
126,"I'll have a chance at him,"" said Ko-ko. ",14027,14067
127,"""He is dead too,"" said the old woman. ",14067,14105
128,"""Is there nobody then left for me to kill?"" ",14105,14149
129,cried Ko-ko. ,14149,14162
130,"""Must I then go back without any blood upon my hands?"" ",14162,14217
131,He made as if he could shed tears over his sad mishap. ,14217,14272
132,"""The father is still living; ",14272,14301
133," and you will find him in the lodge, if you have a mind to call on him. ",14300,14372
134,"He would like to see the Owl,"" the old woman added. ",14372,14424
135,"""He shall,"" replied Ko-ko. ",14424,14451
136,"""Have you any bones about the house; ",14451,14488
137," for I suppose I shall have to climb that tree."" ",14487,14536
138,"""Oh, yes; ",14536,14546
139," plenty,"" answered the old woman. ",14545,14579
140,"""You can have as many as you want."" ",14579,14615
141,"And she gave him a handful of fish-bones, which Ko-ko, taking them to be the Invisible Tallies which had helped Onwee Bahmondang in climbing the magical tree, thrust into his bosom. ",14615,14797
142,"""Thank you,"" said Ko-ko; ",14797,14822
143, taking up his club and striding toward the door. ,14821,14871
144,"""Will you not have a little advice,"" said the old woman. ",14871,14928
145,"""This is a dangerous business you are going on."" ",14928,14977
146,"Ko-ko turned about and laughed to scorn the proposal, and putting forth his right foot from the lodge first, an observance in which he had great hopes, he started for the lodge of the wicked father. ",14977,15176
147,"Ko-ko ran very fast, as if he feared he should lose the chance of massacring any member of the wicked family, until he came in sight of the lodge hanging upon the tree. ",15176,15345
148,"He then slackened his pace, and crept forward with a wary eye lest somebody might chance to be looking out at the door. ",15345,15465
149,"All was, however, still up there; ",15465,15499
150, and Ko-ko clasped the tree and began to climb. ,15498,15546
151,"Away went the lodge, and up went Ko-ko, puffing and panting, after it. ",15546,15617
152,And it was not a great while before the Owl had puffed and panted away all the wind he had to spare; ,15617,15718
153," and yet the lodge kept flying aloft, higher, higher. ",15717,15771
154,What was to be done! ,15771,15792
155,"Ko-ko of course bethought him of the bones, for that was just what, as he knew, had occurred to Onwee Bahmondang under the like circumstances. ",15792,15935
156,He had the bones in his bosom; ,15935,15966
157, and now it was necessary for him to be a squirrel. ,15965,16017
158,"He immediately called on several guardian spirits whom he knew of by name, and requested them to convert him into a squirrel. ",16017,16143
159,But not one of all them seemed to pay the slightest attention to his request; ,16143,16221
160," for there he hung, the same heavy-limbed, big-headed, be-clubbed, and be-blanketed Ko-ko as ever. ",16220,16319
161,He then desired that they would turn him into an opossum; ,16319,16377
162, an application which met with the same luck as the previous one. ,16376,16442
163,"After this he petitioned to be a wolf, a gophir, a dog, or a bear-if they would be so obliging. ",16442,16538
164,"The guardian spirits were either all deaf, or indifferent to his wishes, or absent on some other business. ",16538,16645
165,"Ko-ko, in spite of all his begging and supplication and beseeching, was obliged to be still Ko-ko. ",16645,16744
166,"""The bones, however,"" he said, to himself, ""are good. ",16744,16798
167,"I shall get a nice rest, at any rate, if I am forced to climb as I am."" ",16798,16870
168,"With this he drew out one of the bones from his bosom, and shouting aloud, ""Ho! ",16870,16950
169,ho! ,16950,16954
170,"who is there?"" ",16954,16969
171,"he thrust it into the trunk of the tree, and would have indulged himself in a rest; ",16969,17053
172," but being no more than a common fish-bone, without the slightest savor of magic in it, it snapped with Ko-ko, who came tumbling down, with the door of the lodge which he had shaken loose, rattling after him. ",17052,17261
173,"""Ho! ",16945,16950
174,ho! ,16950,16954
175,"who is there?"" ",16954,16969
176,"cried the wicked father, making his appearance at the opening and looking down. ",17285,17365
177,"""It is I, Onwee Bahmondang!"" ",17365,17394
178,"cried Ko-koor, thinking to frighten the wicked father. ",17394,17449
179,"""Ah! ",17449,17454
180,"it is you, is it? ",17454,17472
181,"I will be there presently,"" called the old man. ",17472,17520
182,"""Do not be in haste to go away!"" ",17520,17553
183,"Ko-ko, observing that the old man was in earnest, scrambled up from the ground, and set off promptly at his highest rate of speed. ",17553,17684
184,"When he looked back and saw that the wicked father was gaining upon him, Ko-koor mounted a tree, as had Onwee Bahmondang before, and fired off a number of arrows, but as they were no more than common arrows, he got nothing by it, but was obliged to descend, and run again for life. ",17684,17966
185,"As he hurried on he encountered the skeleton of a moose, into which he would have transformed himself, but not having the slightest confidence in any one of all the guardians who should have helped him, he passed on. ",17966,18183
186,"The wicked father was hot in pursuit, and Ko-koor was suffering terribly for lack of wind, when luckily he remembered the enchanted moccasins. ",18183,18326
187,"He could not send them to the end of the earth, as had Onwee Bahmondang. ",18326,18399
188,"""I will improve on that dull fellow,"" said Ko-ko. ",18399,18449
189,"""I will put them on myself."" ",18449,18478
190,"Accordingly, Ko-ko had just time to draw on the moccasins when the wicked father came in sight. ",18478,18574
191,"""Go now!"" ",18574,18584
192,"cried Ko-ko, giving orders to the enchanted moccasins; ",18584,18639
193, and go they did; ,18638,18656
194," but to the astonishment of the Owl, they turned immediately about in the way in which the wicked father, now, very furious, was approaching. ",18655,18797
195,"""The other way! ",18797,18813
196,"the other way!"" ",18813,18829
197,cried Ko-ko. ,14149,14162
198,"Cry as loud as he would, the enchanted moccasins would keep on in their own course; ",18842,18926
199," and before he could shake himself out of them, they had run him directly into the face of the wicked father. ",18925,19035
200,"""What do you mean, you Owl?"" ",19035,19064
201,"cried the wicked father, falling upon Ko-ko with a huge club, and counting his ribs at every stroke. ",19064,19165
202,"""I can not help it, good man,"" answered Ko-ko. ",19165,19212
203,"""I tried my best-"" Ko-ko would have gone the other way, but the enchanted moccasins kept hurrying him forward. ",19212,19323
204,"""Stand off, will you?"" ",19323,19346
