0,"Long, long ago, there once lived a king and a queen who had a daughter. ",0,72
1,"One day, when the daughter went walking in the garden, a tremendous storm suddenly came up and carried her away with it. ",72,193
2,"Now the storm had come from the bird with nine heads, who had robbed the princess, and brought her to his cave. ",193,305
3,"The king did not know whither his daughter had disappeared, so he had proclaimed throughout the land: ""Whoever brings back the princess may have her for his bride!"" ",305,470
4,Now a youth had seen the bird as he was carrying the princess to his cave. ,470,545
5,"This cave, though, was in the middle of a sheer wall of rock. ",545,607
6,"One could not climb up to it from below, nor could one climb down to it from above. ",607,691
7,"And as the youth was walking around the rock, another youth came along and asked him what he was doing there. ",691,801
8,"So the first youth told him that the bird with nine heads had carried off the king's daughter, and had brought her up to his cave. ",801,932
9,The other chap knew what he had to do. ,932,971
10,"He called together his friends, and they lowered the youth to the cave in a basket. ",971,1055
11,"And when he went into the cave, he saw the king's daughter sitting there, and washing the wound of the bird with nine heads; ",1055,1180
12," for the hound of heaven had bitten off his tenth head, and his wound was still bleeding. ",1179,1269
13,"The princess, however, motioned to the youth to hide, and he did so. ",1269,1338
14,"When the king's daughter had washed his wound and bandaged it, the bird with nine heads felt so comfortable, that one after another, all his nine heads fell asleep. ",1338,1503
15,"Then the youth stepped forth from his hiding-place, and cut off his nine heads with a sword. ",1503,1596
16,"But the king's daughter said: ""It would be best if you were hauled up first, and I came after."" ",1596,1692
17,"""No,"" said the youth. ",1692,1714
18,"""I will wait below here, until you are in safety."" ",1714,1765
19,At first the king's daughter was not willing; ,1765,1811
20," yet at last she allowed herself to be persuaded, and climbed into the basket. ",1810,1889
21,"But before she did so, she took a long pin from her hair, broke it into two halves and gave him one and kept the other. ",1889,2009
22,"She also divided her silken kerchief with him, and told him to take good care of both her gifts. ",2009,2106
23,"But when the other man had drawn up the king's daughter, he took her along with him, and left the youth in the cave, in spite of all his calling and pleading. ",2106,2265
24,The youth now took a walk about the cave. ,2265,2307
25,"There he saw a number of maidens, all of whom had been carried off by the bird with nine heads, and who had perished there of hunger. ",2307,2441
26,"And on the wall hung a fish, nailed against it with four nails. ",2441,2505
27,"When he touched the fish, the latter turned into a handsome youth, who thanked him for delivering him, and they agreed to regard each other as brothers. ",2505,2658
28,Soon the first youth grew very hungry. ,2658,2697
29,"He stepped out in front of the cave to search for food, but only stones were lying there. ",2697,2787
30,"Then, suddenly, he saw a great dragon, who was licking a stone. ",2787,2851
31,"The youth imitated him, and before long his hunger had disappeared. ",2851,2919
32,"He next asked the dragon how he could get away from the cave, and the dragon nodded his head in the direction of his tail, as much as to say he should seat himself upon it. ",2919,3092
33,"So he climbed up, and in the twinkling of an eye he was down on the ground, and the dragon had disappeared. ",3092,3200
34,He then went on until he found a tortoise-shell full of beautiful pearls. ,3200,3274
35,"But they were magic pearls, for if you flung them into the fire, the fire ceased to burn and if you flung them into the water, the water divided and you could walk through the midst of it. ",3274,3463
36,"The youth took the pearls out of the tortoise-shell, and put them in his pocket. ",3463,3544
37,Not long after he reached the sea-shore. ,3544,3585
38,"Here he flung a pearl into the sea, and at once the waters divided and he could see the sea-dragon. ",3585,3685
39,"The sea-dragon cried: ""Who is disturbing me here in my own kingdom?"" ",3685,3754
40,"The youth answered: ""I found pearls in a tortoise-shell, and have flung one into the sea, and now the waters have divided for me."" ",3754,3885
41,"""If that is the case,"" said the dragon, ""then come into the sea with me and we will live there together."" ",3885,3991
42,Then the youth recognized him for the same dragon whom he had seen in the cave. ,3991,4071
43,And with him was the youth with whom he had formed a bond of brotherhood: He was the dragon's son. ,4071,4170
44,"""Since you have saved my son and become his brother, I am your father,"" said the old dragon. ",4170,4263
45,And he entertained him hospitably with food and wine. ,4263,4317
46,"One day his friend said to him: ""My father is sure to want to reward you. ",4317,4391
47,"But accept no money, nor any jewels from him, but only the little gourd flask over yonder. ",4391,4482
48,"With it you can conjure up whatever you wish."" ",4482,4529
49,"And, sure enough, the old dragon asked him what he wanted by way of a reward, and the youth answered: ""I want no money, nor any jewels. ",4529,4665
50,"All I want is the little gourd flask over yonder."" ",4665,4716
51,"At first the dragon did not wish to give it up, but at last he did let him have it, after all. ",4716,4811
52,And then the youth left the dragon's castle. ,4811,4856
53,When he set his foot on dry land again he felt hungry. ,4856,4911
54,"At once a table stood before him, covered with a fine and plenteous meal. ",4911,4985
55,He ate and drank. ,4985,5003
56,"After he had gone on a while, he felt weary. ",5003,5048
57,"And there stood an ass, waiting for him, on which he mounted. ",5048,5110
58,"After he had ridden for a while, the ass's gait seemed too uneven, and along came a wagon, into which he climbed. ",5110,5224
59,"But the wagon shook him up too, greatly, and he thought: ""If I only had a litter! ",5224,5306
60,"That would suit me better."" ",5306,5334
61,"No more had he thought so, than the litter came along, and he seated himself in it. ",5334,5418
62,"And the bearers carried him to the city in which dwelt the king, the queen and their daughter. ",5418,5513
63,"When the other youth had brought back the king's daughter, it was decided to hold the wedding. ",5513,5608
64,"But the king's daughter was not willing, and said: ""He is not the right man. ",5608,5685
65,"My deliverer will come and bring with him half of the long pin for my hair, and half my silken kerchief as a token."" ",5685,5802
66,"But when the youth did not appear for so long a time, and the other one pressed the king, the king grew impatient and said: ""The wedding shall take place to-morrow!"" ",5802,5968
67,"Then the king's daughter went sadly through the streets of the city, and searched and searched in the hope of finding her deliverer. ",5968,6101
68,And this was on the very day that the litter arrived. ,6101,6155
69,"The king's daughter saw the half of her silken handkerchief in the youth's hand, and filled with joy, she led him to her father. ",6155,6284
70,"There he had to show his half of the long pin, which fitted the other exactly, and then the king was convinced that he was the right, true deliverer. ",6284,6434
71,"The false bridegroom was now punished, the wedding celebrated, and they lived in peace and happiness till the end of their days.",6434,6563
