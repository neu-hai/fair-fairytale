0,It generally happens that people's surroundings reflect more or less accurately their minds and dispositions. ,0,110
1,"Perhaps that is why the Flower Fairy lived in a lovely palace, with the most delightful garden you can imagine. ",110,222
2,"It was full of flowers, and trees, and fountains, and fish-ponds, and everything nice. ",222,309
3,For the Fairy herself was so kind and charming that everybody loved her. ,309,382
4,"All the young princes and princesses who formed her court, were as happy as the day was long, simply because they were near her. ",382,511
5,"They came to her when they were quite tiny, and never left her until they were grown up and had to go away into the great world. ",511,640
6,When that time came she gave to each whatever gift he asked of her. ,640,708
7,But it is chiefly of the Princess Sylvia that you are going to hear now. ,708,781
8,"The Fairy loved her with all her heart, for she was at once original and gentle. ",781,862
9,She had nearly reached the age at which the gifts were generally bestowed. ,862,937
10,"However, the Fairy had a great wish to know how the other princesses who had grown up and left her, were prospering. ",937,1054
11,"Before the time came for Sylvia to go herself, she resolved to send her to some of them. ",1054,1143
12,"So one day her chariot, drawn by butterflies, was made ready, and the Fairy said: 'Sylvia, I am going to send you to the court of Iris. ",1143,1279
13,She will receive you with pleasure for my sake as well as for your own. ,1279,1351
14,"In two months you may come back to me again, and I shall expect you to tell me what you think of her.' ",1351,1454
15,"Sylvia was very unwilling to go away, but as the Fairy wished it she said nothing. ",1454,1537
16,Only when the two months were over she stepped joyfully into the butterfly chariot. ,1537,1621
17,"She could not get back quickly enough to the Flower-Fairy, who, for her part, was equally delighted to see her again. ",1621,1739
18,"'Now, child,' said she, 'tell me what impression you have received.' ",1739,1808
19,"'You sent me, madam,' answered Sylvia, 'to the Court of Iris, on whom you had bestowed the gift of beauty. ",1808,1915
20,"She never tells anyone, however, that it was your gift, though she often speaks of your kindness in general. ",1915,2024
21,"It seemed to me that her loveliness, which fairly dazzled me at first, had absolutely deprived her of the use of any of her other gifts or graces. ",2024,2171
22,"In allowing herself to be seen, she appeared to think that she was doing all that could possibly be required of her. ",2171,2288
23,"But, unfortunately, while I was still with her she became seriously ill. ",2288,2361
24,"Though she presently recovered, her beauty is entirely gone, so that she hates the very sight of herself, and is in despair. ",2361,2486
25,"She entreated me to tell you what had happened, and to beg you, in pity, to give her beauty back to her. ",2486,2591
26,"And, indeed, she does need it terribly, for all the things in her that were tolerable, and even agreeable, when she was so pretty, seem quite different now she is ugly. ",2591,2760
27,"It is so long since she thought of using her mind or her natural cleverness, that I really don't think she has any left now. ",2760,2885
28,"She is quite aware of all this herself, so you may imagine how unhappy she is, and how earnestly she begs for your aid.' ",2885,3006
29,"'You have told me what I wanted to know,' cried the Fairy, 'but alas! ",3006,3076
30,I cannot help her. ,3076,3095
31,My gifts can be given but once.' ,3095,3128
32,"Some time passed in all the usual delights of the Flower-Fairy's palace, and then she sent for Sylvia again. ",3128,3237
33,She told her she was to stay for a little while with the Princess Daphne. ,3237,3311
34,"Accordingly the butterflies whisked her off, and set her down in quite a strange kingdom. ",3311,3401
35,"She had only been there a very little time before a wandering butterfly brought a message from her to the Fairy, begging that she might be sent for as soon as possible. ",3401,3570
36,Before very long she was allowed to return. ,3570,3614
37,'Ah! ,3614,3619
38,"madam,' cried she, 'what a place you sent me to that time!' ",3619,3679
39,"'Why, what was the matter?' ",3679,3707
40,asked the Fairy. ,3707,3724
41,"'Daphne was one of the princesses who asked for the gift of eloquence, if I remember rightly.' ",3724,3819
42,"'And very ill the gift of eloquence becomes a woman,' replied Sylvia, with an air of conviction. ",3819,3916
43,"'It is true that she speaks well, and her expressions are well chosen. ",3916,3987
44,"But then she never leaves off talking, and though at first one may be amused, one ends by being wearied to death. ",3987,4101
45,Above all things she loves any assembly for settling the affairs of her kingdom. ,4101,4182
46,On those occasions she can talk and talk without fear of interruption. ,4182,4253
47,"Even then, the moment it is over she is ready to begin again about anything or nothing, as the case may be. ",4253,4361
48,Oh! ,4361,4365
49,how glad I was to come away I cannot tell you.' ,4365,4413
50,The Fairy smiled at Sylvia's unfeigned disgust at her late experience. ,4413,4484
51,"After allowing her a little time to recover she sent her to the Court of the Princess Cynthia, where she left her for three months. ",4484,4616
52,At the end of that time Sylvia came back to her with all the joy and contentment that one feels at being once more beside a dear friend. ,4616,4753
53,"The Fairy, as usual, was anxious to hear what she thought of Cynthia, who had always been amiable, and to whom she had given the gift of pleasing. ",4753,4900
54,"'I thought at first,' said Sylvia, 'that she must be the happiest Princess in the world. ",4900,4989
55,She had a thousand lovers who vied with one another in their efforts to please and gratify her. ,4989,5085
56,"Indeed, I had nearly decided that I would ask a similar gift.' ",5085,5148
57,"'Have you altered your mind, then?' ",5148,5184
58,interrupted the Fairy. ,5184,5207
59,"'Yes, indeed, madam,' replied Sylvia. ",5207,5245
60,'and I will tell you why. ,5245,5271
61,The longer I stayed the more I saw that Cynthia was not really happy. ,5271,5341
62,"In her desire to please everyone she ceased to be sincere, and degenerated into a mere coquette. ",5341,5438
63,"Even her lovers felt that the charms and fascinations which were exercised upon all who approached her without distinction were valueless, so that in the end they ceased to care for them, and went away disdainfully.' ",5438,5655
64,"'I am pleased with you, child,' said the Fairy; ",5655,5703
65, 'enjoy yourself here for awhile and presently you shall go to Phyllida.' ,5702,5776
66,"Sylvia was glad to have leisure to think, for she could not make up her mind at all what she should ask for herself, and the time was drawing very near. ",5776,5929
67,"However, before very long the Fairy sent her to Phyllida, and waited for her report with unabated interest. ",5929,6037
68,"'I reached her court safely,' said Sylvia, 'and she received me with much kindness, and immediately began to exercise upon me that brilliant wit which you had bestowed upon her. ",6037,6215
69,"I confess that I was fascinated by it, and for a week thought that nothing could be more desirable. ",6215,6315
70,"The time passed like magic, so great was the charm of her society. ",6315,6382
71,"But I ended by ceasing to covet that gift more than any of the others I have seen, for, like the gift of pleasing, it cannot really give satisfaction. ",6382,6533
72,"By degrees I wearied of what had so delighted me at first, especially as I perceived more and more plainly that it is impossible to be constantly smart and amusing without being frequently ill-natured, and too apt to turn all things, even the most serious, into mere occasions for a brilliant jest.' ",6533,6833
73,"The Fairy in her heart agreed with Sylvia's conclusions, and felt pleased with herself for having brought her up so well. ",6833,6955
74,"But now the time was come for Sylvia to receive her gift, and all her companions were assembled. ",6955,7052
75,The Fairy stood in the midst and in the usual manner asked what she would take with her into the great world. ,7052,7162
76,"Sylvia paused for a moment, and then answered: 'A quiet spirit.' ",7162,7227
77,And the Fairy granted her request. ,7227,7262
78,"This lovely gift makes life a constant happiness to its possessor, and to all who are brought into contact with her. ",7262,7379
79,She has all the beauty of gentleness and contentment in her sweet face. ,7379,7451
80,"If at times it seems less lovely through some chance grief or disquietude, the hardest thing that one ever hears said is: 'Sylvia's dear face is pale to-day. ",7451,7609
81,It grieves one to see her so.' ,7609,7640
82,"And when, on the contrary, she is gay and joyful, the sunshine of her presence rejoices all who have the happiness of being near her.",7640,7774
