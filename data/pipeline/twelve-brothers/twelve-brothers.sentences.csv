0,"THERE were once upon a time a King and a Queen who lived happily together, and they had twelve children, all of whom were boys. ",0,128
1,"One day the King said to his wife: 'If our thirteenth child is a girl, all her twelve brothers must die, so that she may be very rich and the kingdom hers alone.' ",128,291
2,"Then he ordered twelve coffins to be made, and filled them with shavings, and placed a little pillow in each. ",291,401
3,"These he put away in an empty room, and, giving the key to his wife, he bade her tell no one of it. ",401,501
4,"The Queen grieved over the sad fate of her sons and refused to be comforted, so much so that the youngest boy, who was always with her, and whom she had christened Benjamin, said to her one day: 'Dear mother, why are you so sad?' ",501,731
5,"'My child,' she answered, 'I may not tell you the reason.' ",731,790
6,"But he left her no peace, till she went and unlocked the room and showed him the twelve coffins filled with shavings, and with the little pillow laid in each. ",790,949
7,"Then she said: 'My dearest Benjamin, your father has had these coffins made for you and your eleven brothers, because if I bring a girl into the world you are all to be killed and buried in them.' ",949,1146
8,"She wept bitterly as she spoke, but her son comforted her and said: 'Don't cry, dear mother; ",1146,1239
9," we'll manage to escape somehow, and will fly for our lives.' ",1238,1300
10,"'Yes,' replied his mother, 'that is what you must do-go with your eleven brothers out into the wood, and let one of you always sit on the highest tree you can find, keeping watch on the tower of the castle. ",1300,1507
11,"If I give birth to a little son I will wave a white flag, and then you may safely return; ",1507,1597
12," but if I give birth to a little daughter I will wave a red flag, which will warn you to fly away as quickly as you can, and may the kind Heaven have pity on you. ",1596,1759
13,"Every night I will get up and pray for you, in winter that you may always have a fire to warm yourselves by, and in summer that you may not languish in the heat.' ",1759,1922
14,Then she blessed her sons and they set out into the wood. ,1922,1980
15,"They found a very high oak tree, and there they sat, turn about, keeping their eyes always fixed on the castle tower. ",1980,2098
16,"On the twelfth day, when the turn came to Benjamin, he noticed a flag waving in the air, but alas! ",2098,2197
17,"it was not white, but blood red, the sign which told them they must all die. ",2197,2274
18,"When the brothers heard this they were very angry, and said: 'Shall we forsooth suffer death for the sake of a wretched girl? ",2274,2400
19,"Let us swear vengeance, and vow that wherever and whenever we shall meet one of her sex, she shall die at our hands.' ",2400,2518
20,"Then they went their way deeper into the wood, and in the middle of it, where it was thickest and darkest, they came upon a little enchanted house which stood empty. ",2518,2684
21,"'Here,' they said, 'let us take up our abode, and you, Benjamin, you are the youngest and weakest, you shall stay at home and keep house for us; ",2684,2829
22, we others will go out and fetch food.' ,2828,2868
23,"So they went forth into the wood, and shot hares and roe-deer, birds and wood-pigeons, and any other game they came across. ",2868,2992
24,"They always brought their spoils home to Benjamin, who soon learnt to make them into dainty dishes. ",2992,3092
25,"So they lived for ten years in this little house, and the time slipped merrily away. ",3092,3177
26,In the meantime their little sister at home was growing up quickly. ,3177,3245
27,"She was kind-hearted and of a fair countenance, and she had a gold star right in the middle of her forehead. ",3245,3354
28,"One day a big washing was going on at the palace, and the girl looking down from her window saw twelve men's shirts hanging up to dry, and asked her mother: 'Who in the world do these shirts belong to? ",3354,3556
29,Surely they are far too small for my father?' ,3556,3602
30,"And the Queen answered sadly: 'Dear child, they belong to your twelve brothers.' ",3602,3683
31,'But where are my twelve brothers?' ,3683,3719
32,said the girl. ,3719,3734
33,'I have never even heard of them.' ,3734,3769
34,"'Heaven alone knows in what part of the wide world they are wandering,' replied her mother. ",3769,3861
35,Then she took the girl and opened the locked-up room; ,3861,3915
36," she showed her the twelve coffins filled with shavings, and with the little pillow laid in each. ",3914,4012
37,"'These coffins,' she said, 'were intended for your brothers, but they stole secretly away before you were born.' ",4012,4125
38,"Then she to tell her all that had happened, and when she had finished her daughter said: 'Do not cry, dearest mother; ",4125,4243
39, I will go and seek my brothers till I find them.' ,4242,4293
40,So she took the twelve shirts and went on straight into the middle of the big wood. ,4293,4377
41,"She walked all day long, and came in the evening to the little enchanted house. ",4377,4457
42,"She stepped in and found a youth who, marvelling at her beauty, at the royal robes she wore, and at the golden star on her forehead, asked her where she came from and whither she was going. ",4457,4647
43,"'I am a Princess,' she answered, 'and am seeking for my twelve brothers. ",4647,4720
44,I mean to wander as far as the blue sky stretches over the earth till I find them.' ,4720,4804
45,"Then she showed him the twelve shirts which she had taken with her, and Benjamin saw that it must be his sister, and said: 'I am Benjamin, your youngest brother.' ",4804,4967
46,"So they wept for joy, and kissed and hugged each other again and again. ",4967,5039
47,"After a time Benjamin said: 'Dear sister, there is still a little difficulty, for we had all agreed that any girl we met should die at our hands, because it was for the sake of a girl that we had to leave our kingdom.' ",5039,5258
48,"'But,' she replied, 'I will gladly die if by that means I can restore my twelve brothers to their own.' ",5258,5362
49,"'No,' he answered, 'there is no need for that; ",5362,5409
50," only go and hide under that tub till our eleven brothers come in, and I'll soon make matters right with them.' ",5408,5520
51,"She did as she was bid, and soon the others came home from the chase and sat down to supper. ",5520,5613
52,"'Well, Benjamin, what's the news?' ",5613,5648
53,they asked. ,5648,5660
54,"But he replied, 'I like that; ",5660,5690
55, have you nothing to tell me?' ,5689,5720
56,"'No,' they answered. ",5720,5741
57,"Then he said: 'Well, now, you've been out in the wood all the day and I've stayed quietly at home, and all the same I know more than you do.' ",5741,5883
58,"'Then tell us,' they cried. ",5883,5911
59,But he answered: 'Only on condition that you promise faithfully that the first girl we meet shall not be killed.' ,5911,6025
60,"'She shall be spared,' they promised, 'only tell us the news.' ",6025,6088
61,Then Benjamin said: 'Our sister is here!' ,6088,6130
62,"and he lifted up the tub and the Princess stepped forward, with her royal robes and with the golden star on her forehead, looking so lovely and sweet and charming that they all fell in love with her on the spot. ",6130,6342
63,"They arranged that she should stay at home with Benjamin and help him in the house work, while the rest of the brothers went out into the wood and shot hares and roe-deer, birds and wood-pigeons. ",6342,6538
64,And Benjamin and his sister cooked their meals for them. ,6538,6595
65,"She gathered herbs to cook the vegetables in, fetched the wood, and watched the pots on the fire, and always when her eleven brothers returned she had their supper ready for them. ",6595,6775
66,"Besides this, she kept the house in order, tidied all the rooms, and made herself so generally useful that her brothers were delighted, and they all lived happily together. ",6775,6948
67,"One day the two at home prepared a fine feast, and when they were all assembled they sat down and ate and drank and made merry. ",6948,7076
68,"Now there was a little garden round the enchanted house, in which grew twelve tall lilies. ",7076,7167
69,"The girl, wishing to please her brothers, plucked the twelve flowers, meaning to present one to each of them as they sat at supper. ",7167,7299
70,"But hardly had she plucked the flowers when her brothers were turned into twelve ravens, who flew croaking over the wood, and the house and garden vanished also. ",7299,7461
71,"So the poor girl found herself left all alone in the wood, and as she looked round her she noticed an old woman standing close beside her, who said: 'My child, what have you done? ",7461,7641
72,Why didn't you leave the flowers alone? ,7641,7681
73,They were your twelve brothers. ,7681,7713
74,Now they are changed for ever into ravens.' ,7713,7757
75,"The girl asked, sobbing: 'Is there no means of setting them free?' ",7757,7824
76,"'No,' said the old woman, 'there is only one way in the whole world, and that is so difficult that you won't free them by it, for you would have to be dumb and not laugh for seven years, and if you spoke a single word, though but an hour were wanting to the time, your silence would all have been in vain, and that one word would slay your brothers.' ",7824,8175
77,Then the girl said to herself: 'If that is all I am quite sure I can free my brothers.' ,8175,8263
78,"So she searched for a high tree, and when she had found one she climbed up it and spun all day long, never laughing or speaking one word. ",8263,8401
79,"Now it happened one day that a King who was hunting in the wood had a large greyhound, who ran sniffing to the tree on which the girl sat, and jumped round it, yelping and barking furiously. ",8401,8592
80,"The King's attention was attracted, and when he looked up and beheld the beautiful Princess with the golden star on her forehead, he was so enchanted by her beauty that he asked her on the spot to be his wife. ",8592,8802
81,"She gave no answer, but nodded slightly with her head. ",8802,8857
82,"Then he climbed up the tree himself, lifted her down, put her on his horse and bore her home to his palace. ",8857,8965
83,"The marriage was celebrated with much pomp and ceremony, but the bride neither spoke nor laughed. ",8965,9063
84,"When they had lived a few years happily together, the King's mother, who was a wicked old woman, began to slander the young Queen, and said to the King: 'She is only a low-born beggar maid that you have married; ",9063,9275
85, who knows what mischief she is up to? ,9274,9313
86,"If she is deaf and can't speak, she might at least laugh; ",9313,9371
87," depend upon it, those who don't laugh have a bad conscience.' ",9370,9433
88,"At first the King paid no heed to her words, but the old woman harped so long on the subject, and accused the young Queen of so many bad things, that at last he let himself be talked over, and condemned his beautiful wife to death. ",9433,9665
89,"So a great fire was lit in the courtyard of the palace, where she was to be burnt, and the King watched the proceedings from an upper window, crying bitterly the while, for he still loved his wife dearly. ",9665,9870
90,"But just as she had been bound to the stake, and the flames were licking her garments with their red tongues, the very last moment of the seven years had come. ",9870,10030
91,"Then a sudden rushing sound was heard in the air, and twelve ravens were seen flying overhead. ",10030,10125
92,"They swooped downwards, and as soon as they touched the ground they turned into her twelve brothers, and she knew that she had freed them. ",10125,10264
93,"They quenched the flames and put out the fire, and, unbinding their dear sister from the stake, they kissed and hugged her again and again. ",10264,10404
94,"And now that she was able to open her mouth and speak, she told the King why she had been dumb and not able to laugh. ",10404,10522
95,"The King rejoiced greatly when he heard she was innocent, and they all lived happily ever afterwards.",10522,10624
