0,"Once upon a time there was a poor woman, who lived in a wretched hut far away from the village. ",0,96
1,"She had but little to bite and less to burn, so she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood. ",96,198
2,"He skipped and leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he walked. ",198,505
3,"When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he crossed a field of stubble. ",505,595
4,There he saw lying a jagged white stone. ,595,636
5,"""O, you poor old stone, how white and pale you are! ",636,688
6,"You must be freezing terribly!"" ",688,720
7,said the boy; ,720,734
8," took off his jacket, and laid it over the stone. ",733,783
9,"And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked him how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his shirt-sleeves. ",783,923
10,"He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite white and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket. ",923,1046
11,"""You fool,"" said the woman, ""do you think a stone can freeze? ",1046,1108
12,"And even if it had chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. ",1108,1180
13,"Your clothes cost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out in the field!""-",1180,1278
14,--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his jacket. ,1277,1342
15,"When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had raised itself from the ground on one side. ",1342,1449
16,"""Yes, and I'm sure it is because you have the jacket, poor fellow!"" ",1449,1517
17,said the boy. ,1517,1531
18,"But when he looked more closely, there was a chest full of bright silver coins under the stone. ",1531,1627
19,"""That must be stolen money,"" thought the boy, ""for no one lays money honestly earned under stones in the wood."" ",1627,1739
20,"And he took the chest, and carried it down to the pond nearby, and threw in the whole pile of money. ",1739,1840
21,But a four-shilling piece was left swimming on the top of the water. ,1840,1909
22,"""Well, this one is honest, for whatever is honest will float,"" said the boy. ",1909,1986
23,And he took the four-shilling piece and the jacket home with him. ,1986,2052
24,"He told his mother what had happened to him, that the stone had turned around, and that he had found a chest full of silver coins, and had thrown it into the pond because it was stolen money. ",2052,2244
25,"""But a four-shilling piece floated, and that I took along, because it was honest,"" said the boy. ",2244,2341
26,"""You are a fool,"" said the woman--for she was as angry as could be--""if nothing were honest save what floats on the water, there would be but little honesty left in the world. ",2341,2517
27,"And if the money had been stolen ten times over, still you had found it, and charity begins at home. ",2517,2618
28,"If you had kept the money, we might have passed the rest of our lives in peace and comfort. ",2618,2710
29,"But you are a dunderhead and will stay a dunderhead, and I won't be tormented and burdened with you any longer. ",2710,2822
30,"Now you must get out and earn your own living."" ",2822,2870
31,"So the boy had to go out into the wide world, and wandered about far and near looking for service. ",2870,2969
32,"But wherever he went people found him too small or too weak, and said that they could make no use of him. ",2969,3075
33,At last he came to a merchant. ,3075,3106
34,"There they kept him to work in the kitchen, and he had to fetch wood and water for the cook. ",3106,3199
35,"When he had been there for some time, the merchant decided to journey to far countries, and asked all his servants what he should buy and bring back home for them. ",3199,3363
36,"After all had told him what they wanted, came the turn of the little fellow who carried wood and water for the kitchen. ",3363,3483
37,He handed him his four-shilling piece. ,3483,3522
38,"""Well, and what am I to buy for it?"" ",3522,3559
39,asked the merchant. ,3559,3579
40,"""It will not be a large purchase."" ",3579,3614
41,"""Buy whatever it will bring, it is honest money, that I know,"" said the boy. ",3614,3691
42,"His master promised to do so, and sailed away. ",3691,3738
43,"Now when the merchant had discharged his cargo in foreign parts and had reloaded, and had bought what his servants had desired, he went back to his ship, and was about to shove off. ",3738,3920
44,"Not until then did he remember that the scullion had given him a four-shilling piece, with which to buy him something. ",3920,4039
45,"""Must I go up to the city again because of this four-shilling piece? ",4039,4108
46,"One only has one's troubles when one bothers with such truck,"" thought the merchant. ",4108,4193
47,Then along came a woman with a bag on her back. ,4193,4241
48,"""What have you in your bag, granny?"" ",4241,4278
49,asked the merchant. ,3559,3579
50,"""O, it is only a cat! ",4298,4320
51,"I can feed her no longer, and so I want to throw her into the sea in order to get rid of her,"" said the old woman. ",4320,4435
52,"""The boy told me to buy whatever I could get for the four-shilling piece,"" said the merchant to himself, and asked the woman whether he could have her cat for four shillings. ",4435,4610
53,"The woman agreed without delay, and the bargain was closed. ",4610,4670
54,"Now when the merchant had sailed on for a while, a terrible storm broke loose, a thunderstorm without an equal, and he drifted and drifted, and did not know where or whither. ",4670,4845
55,"At last he came to a land where he had never yet been, and went up into the city. ",4845,4927
56,"In the tavern which he entered the table was set, and at every place lay a switch, one for each guest. ",4927,5030
57,"This seemed strange to the merchant, for he could not understand what was to be done with all the switches. ",5030,5138
58,"Yet he sat down and thought: ""I will watch carefully, and see just what the rest do with them, and then I can imitate them."" ",5138,5263
59,"Yes, and when the food came on the table, then he knew why the switches were there: the place was alive with thousands of mice, and all who were sitting at the table had to work and fight and beat about them with their switches, and nothing could be heard but the slapping of the switches, one worse than the other. ",5263,5579
60,"Sometimes people hit each other in the face, and then they had to take time to say, ""Excuse me!"" ",5579,5676
61,"""Eating is hard work in this country,"" said the merchant. ",5676,5734
62,"""How is it the folk here have no cats?"" ",5734,5774
63,"""Cats?"" ",5774,5782
64,said the people: they did not know what they were. ,5782,5833
65,"Then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the scullion brought, and when the cat went over the table, the mice had to hurry into their holes, and not in the memory of man had the people been able to eat in such comfort. ",5833,6064
66,Then they begged and implored the merchant to sell them his cat. ,6064,6129
67,At last he said he would let them have her; ,6129,6173
68," but he wanted a hundred dollars for her, and this they paid, and thanked him kindly into the bargain. ",6172,6275
69,"Then the merchant sailed on, but no sooner had he reached the high seas than he saw the cat sitting at the top of the main-mast. ",6275,6404
70,"And immediately after another storm and tempest arose, far worse than the first one, and he drifted and drifted, till he came to a land where he had never yet been. ",6404,6569
71,"Again the merchant went to a tavern, and here, too, the table was covered with switches; ",6569,6658
72, but they were much larger and longer than at the place where he had first been. ,6657,6738
73,And they were much needed; ,6738,6765
74," for there were a good many more mice, and they were twice the size of those he had first seen. ",6764,6860
75,"Here he again sold his cat, and this time he received two hundred dollars for her, and that without any haggling. ",6860,6974
76,"But when he had sailed off and was out at sea a way, there sat the cat up in the mast. ",6974,7061
77,"And the storm at once began again, and finally he was again driven to a land in which he had never been. ",7061,7166
78,"Again he turned in at a tavern, and there the table was also covered with switches; ",7166,7250
79," but every switch was a yard and a half long, and as thick as a small broom, and the people told him that they knew of nothing more disagreeable than to sit down to eat, for there were great, ugly rats by the thousand. ",7249,7468
80,"Only with toil and trouble could one manage to shove a bite of something into one's mouth once in a while, so hard was it to defend oneself against the rats. ",7468,7626
81,"Then the cat was again brought from the ship, and now the people could eat in peace. ",7626,7711
82,They begged and pleaded that the merchant sell them his cat; ,7711,7772
83, and for a long time he refused; ,7771,7804
84, but at last he promised that they should have her for three hundred dollars. ,7803,7881
85,"And they paid him, and thanked him, and blessed him into the bargain. ",7881,7951
86,"Now when the merchant was out at sea again, he considered how much the boy had gained with the four-shilling piece he had given him. ",7951,8084
87,"""Well, he shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not all of it. ",8084,8175
88,"For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him, and charity begins at home."" ",8175,8264
89,"But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. ",8264,8385
90,Then the merchant realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that the boy should have all the money. ,8385,8509
91,"No sooner had he made his vow, than the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey home. ",8509,8619
92,"And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and his daughter to boot. ",8619,8707
93,"For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness. ",8707,8827
94,And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ,8827,8877
95,"""For I do not believe that charity begins at home,"" said the youth.",8877,8945
