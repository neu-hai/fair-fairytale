0,"There was once upon a time a King who had a wife with golden hair, and she was so beautiful that you couldn't find anyone like her in the world. ",0,145
1,"It happened that she fell ill, and when she felt that she must soon die, she sent for the King, and said, 'If you want to marry after my death, make no one queen unless she is just as beautiful as I am, and has just such golden hair as I have. ",145,389
2,Promise me this.' ,389,407
3,"After the King had promised her this, she closed her eyes and died. ",407,475
4,"For a long time the King was not to be comforted, and he did not even think of taking a second wife. ",475,576
5,"At last his councillors said, 'The King must marry again, so that we may have a queen.' ",576,664
6,So messengers were sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late Queen in beauty. ,664,756
7,"But there was no one in the wide world, and if there had been she could not have had such golden hair. ",756,859
8,"Then the messengers came home again, not having been able to find a queen. ",859,934
9,"Now, the King had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead mother, and had just such golden hair. ",934,1041
10,"One day when she had grown up, her father looked at her, and saw that she was exactly like her mother, so he said to his councillors, 'I will marry my daughter to one of you, and she shall be queen, for she is exactly like her dead mother, and when I die her husband shall be king.' ",1041,1324
11,"But when the Princess heard of her father's decision, she was not at all pleased, and said to him, 'Before I do your bidding, I must have three dresses; ",1324,1477
12," one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars. ",1476,1563
13,"Besides these, I want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin; ",1563,1637
14, every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it.' ,1636,1702
15,"But she thought to herself, 'This will be quite impossible, and I shall not have to marry someone I do not care for.' ",1702,1820
16,"The King, however, was not to be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens in his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; ",1820,2053
17," and he gave orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the kingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand pieces of fur. ",2052,2220
18,"At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak to be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and said, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.' ",2220,2390
19,"When the Princess saw that there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she determined to flee away. ",2390,2506
20,"In the night, when everyone else was sleeping, she got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a little gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; ",2506,2666
21," she put the sun, moon, and star dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made her face and hands black with soot. ",2665,2800
22,"Then she commended herself to God, and went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large forest. ",2800,2911
23,And as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree and fell asleep. ,2911,2993
24,"The sun rose and she still slept on and on, although it was nearly noon. ",2993,3066
25,"Now, it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting in it. ",3066,3143
26,"When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran round and round it, barking. ",3143,3226
27,"The King said to the huntsmen, 'See what sort of a wild beast is in there.' ",3226,3302
28,"The huntsmen went in, and then came back and said, 'In the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we don't know, and we have never seen one like it; ",3302,3459
29, its skin is made of a thousand pieces of fur; ,3458,3505
30, but it is lying down asleep.' ,3504,3535
31,"The King said, 'See if you can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the cart, and we will take it with us.' ",3535,3644
32,"When the huntsmen seized the maiden, she awoke and was frightened, and cried out to them, 'I am a poor child, forsaken by father and mother; ",3644,3785
33," take pity on me, and let me go with you.' ",3784,3827
34,"Then they said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can work in the kitchen; ",3827,3902
35, come with us and sweep the ashes together.' ,3901,3946
36,So they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace. ,3946,4008
37,"There they showed her a tiny room under the stairs, where no daylight came, and said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can live and sleep here.' ",4008,4154
38,"Then she was sent into the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, poked the fire, washed vegetables, plucked fowls, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work. ",4154,4322
39,So the Many-furred Creature lived for a long time in great poverty. ,4322,4390
40,"Ah, beautiful King's daughter, what is going to befall you now? ",4390,4454
41,"It happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace, that she said to the cook, 'Can I go upstairs for a little bit and look on? ",4454,4596
42,I will stand outside the doors.' ,4596,4629
43,"The cook replied, 'Yes, you can go up, but in half-an-hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes.' ",4629,4734
44,"Then she took her little oil-lamp, and went into her little room, drew off her fur cloak, and washed off the soot from her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth, and it was as if one sunbeam after another were coming out of a black cloud. ",4734,4982
45,"Then she opened the nut, and took out the dress as golden as the sun. ",4982,5052
46,"And when she had done this, she went up to the feast, and everyone stepped out of her way, for nobody knew her, and they thought she must be a King's daughter. ",5052,5212
47,"But the King came towards her and gave her his hand, and danced with her, thinking to himself, 'My eyes have never beheld anyone so fair!' ",5212,5351
48,"When the dance was ended, she curtseyed to him, and when the King looked round she had disappeared, no one knew whither. ",5351,5472
49,"The guards who were standing before the palace were called and questioned, but no one had seen her. ",5472,5572
50,"She had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress, made her face and hands black, put on the fur cloak, and was once more the Many-furred Creature. ",5572,5737
51,"When she came into the kitchen and was setting about her work of sweeping the ashes together, the cook said to her, 'Let that wait till to-morrow, and just cook the King's soup for me; ",5737,5922
52, I want to have a little peep at the company upstairs; ,5921,5976
53," but be sure that you do not let a hair fall into it, otherwise you will get nothing to eat in future!' ",5975,6079
54,"So the cook went away, and the Many-furred Creature cooked the soup for the King. ",6079,6161
55,"She made a bread-soup as well as she possibly could, and when it was done, she fetched her gold ring from her little room, and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up. ",6161,6349
56,"When the dance was ended, the King had his soup brought to him and ate it, and it was so good that he thought he had never tasted such soup in his life. ",6349,6502
57,"But when he came to the bottom of the dish he saw a gold ring lying there, and he could not imagine how it got in. ",6502,6617
58,Then he commanded the cook to be brought before him. ,6617,6670
59,"The cook was terrified when he heard the command, and said to the Many-furred Creature, 'You must have let a hair fall into the soup, and if you have you deserve a good beating!' ",6670,6849
60,"When he came before the King, the King asked who had cooked the soup. ",6849,6919
61,"The cook answered, 'I cooked it.' ",6919,6953
62,"But the King said, 'That's not true, for it was quite different and much better soup than you have ever cooked.' ",6953,7066
63,"Then the cook said, 'I must confess; ",7066,7103
64, I did not cook the soup; ,7102,7128
65, the Many-furred Creature did.' ,7127,7159
66,"'Let her be brought before me,' said the King. ",7159,7206
67,"When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she was. ",7206,7274
68,'I am a poor child without father or mother.' ,7274,7320
69,"Then he asked her, 'What do you do in my palace?' ",7320,7370
70,'I am of no use except to have boots thrown at my head.' ,7370,7427
71,'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' ,7427,7477
72,he asked. ,7477,7487
73,"'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. ",7487,7541
74,"So the King could find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away. ",7541,7611
75,"After a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. ",7611,7740
76,"He answered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King the bread-soup that he likes so much.' ",7740,7852
77,"So she ran away to her little room, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver as the moon and put it on. ",7852,7979
78,"Then she went upstairs looking just like a King's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her again, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together. ",7979,8153
79,"But when the dance was ended, she disappeared again so quickly that the King could not see which way she went. ",8153,8264
80,"She ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the Many-furred Creature, and went into the kitchen to cook the bread-soup. ",8264,8402
81,"When the cook was upstairs, she fetched the golden spinning-wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it. ",8402,8528
82,"It was brought to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as the last time. ",8528,8607
83,"He had the cook sent to him, and again he had to confess that the Many-furred Creature had cooked the soup. ",8607,8715
84,"Then the Many-furred Creature came before the King, but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning-wheel. ",8715,8913
85,"When the King had a feast for the third time, things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two. ",8913,9019
86,"The cook said, 'You must be a witch, Many-furred Creature, for you always put something in the soup, so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the King than any that I cook.' ",9019,9198
87,"But because she begged hard, he let her go up for the usual time. ",9198,9264
88,"Now she put on the dress as shining as the stars, and stepped into the hall in it. ",9264,9347
89,"The King danced again with the beautiful maiden, and thought she had never looked so beautiful. ",9347,9443
90,"And while he was dancing, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and he commanded that the dance should last longer than usual. ",9443,9588
91,"When it was finished he wanted to keep her hands in his, but she broke from him, and sprang so quickly away among the people that she vanished from his sight. ",9588,9747
92,"She ran as fast as she could to her little room under the stairs, but because she had stayed too long beyond the half-hour, she could not stop to take off the beautiful dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black with the soot, one finger remaining white. ",9747,10058
93,"The Many-furred Creature now ran into the kitchen, cooked the King's bread-soup, and when the cook had gone, she laid the gold reel in the dish. ",10058,10203
94,"When the King found the reel at the bottom, he had the Many-furred Creature brought to him, and then he saw the white finger, and the ring which he had put on her hand in the dance. ",10203,10385
95,"Then he took her hand and held her tightly, and as she was trying to get away, she undid the fur-cloak a little bit and the star-dress shone out. ",10385,10531
96,The King seized the cloak and tore it off her. ,10531,10578
97,"Her golden hair came down, and she stood there in her full splendour, and could not hide herself away any more. ",10578,10690
98,"And when the soot and ashes had been washed from her face, she looked more beautiful than anyone in the world. ",10690,10801
99,"But the King said, 'You are my dear bride, and we will never be separated from one another.' ",10801,10894
100,So the wedding was celebrated and they lived happily ever after.,10894,10959
