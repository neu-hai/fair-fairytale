0,"People may have heard of the renowned adventures of Daniel O'Rourke, but how few are there who know that the cause of all his perils, above and below, was neither more nor less than his having slept under the walls of the Pooka's Tower. ",0,237
1,I knew the man well. ,237,258
2,"He lived at the bottom of Hungry Hill, just at the right-hand side of the road as you go towards Bantry. ",258,363
3,"An old man was he at the time he told me the story, with grey hair and a red nose; ",363,446
4," and it was on the 25th of June, 1813, that I heard it from his own lips, as he sat smoking his pipe under the old poplar tree, on as fine an evening as ever shone from the sky. ",445,623
5,"I was going to visit the caves in Dursey Island, having spent the morning at Glengariff. ",623,712
6,"""I am often axed to tell it, sir,"" said he, ""so that this is not the first time. ",712,793
7,"The master's son, you see, had come from beyond foreign parts in France and Spain, as young gentlemen used to go before Buonaparte or any such was heard of; ",793,950
8," and, sure enough, there was a dinner given to all the people on the ground, gentle and simple, high and low, rich and poor. ",949,1074
9,"The ould gentlemen were the gentlemen, after all, saving your honour's presence. ",1074,1155
10,"They'd swear at a body a little, to be sure, and, maybe, give one a cut of a whip now and then, but we were no losers by it in the end; ",1155,1291
11," and they were so easy and civil, and kept such rattling houses, and thousands of welcomes; ",1290,1382
12," and there was no grinding for rent, and there was hardly a tenant on the estate that did not taste of his landlord's bounty often and often in a year; ",1381,1533
13, but now it's another thing. ,1532,1561
14,"No matter for that, sir, for I'd better be telling you my story."" ",1561,1627
15,"Well, we had everything of the best, and plenty of it; ",1627,1682
16," and we ate, and we drank, and we danced, and the young master, by the same token, danced with Peggy Barry, from the Bohereen--a lovely young couple they were, though they are both low enough now. ",1681,1878
17,"To make a long story short, I got, as a body may say, the same thing as tipsy almost, for I can't remember, ever at all, no ways, how it was I left the place; ",1878,2037
18," only I did leave it, that's certain. ",2036,2074
19,"Well, I thought, for all that, in myself, I'd just step to Molly Cronohan's, the fairy woman, to speak a word about the bracket heifer that was bewitched; ",2074,2229
20," and so, as I was crossing the stepping-stones of the ford of Ballyashenogh, and was looking up at the stars, an blessing myself--for why? ",2228,2367
21,"it was Lady-day--I missed my foot, and souse I fell into the water. ",2367,2435
22,'Death alive!' ,2435,2450
23,"thought I, 'I'll be drowned now!' ",2450,2484
24,"However, I began swimming, swimming, swimming away for dear life, till at last I got ashore, somehow or other, but never the one of me can tell how, upon a dissolute island. ",2484,2658
25,"I wandered and wandered about there, without knowing where I wandered, until at last I got into a big bog. ",2658,2765
26,"The moon was shining as bright as day, or your fair lady's eyes, sir (with your pardon for mentioning her), and I looked east and west, north and south, and every way, and nothing did I see but bog, bog, bog. ",2765,2974
27,I could never find out how I got into it; ,2974,3016
28," and my heart grew cold with fear, for sure and certain I was that it would be my berrin' place. ",3015,3112
29,"So I sat upon a stone, which, as good luck would have it, was close by me, and I began to scratch my head, and sing the ULLAGONE--when all of a sudden the moon grew black, and I looked up and saw something for all the world as if it was moving down between me and it, and I could not tell what it was. ",3112,3414
30,"Down it came with a pounce, and looked at me full in the face; ",3414,3477
31, and what was it but an eagle?--as fine a one as ever flew from the kingdom of Kerry! ,3476,3562
32,"So he looked at me in the face, and says he to me, 'Daniel O'Rourke,' says he, 'how do you do?' ",3562,3658
33,"'Very well, I thank you, sir,' says I; ",3658,3697
34, 'I hope you're well';,3696,3718
35, wondering out of my senses all the time how an eagle came to speak like a Christian. ,3718,3804
36,"'What brings you here, Dan?' ",3804,3833
37,says he. ,3833,3842
38,"'Nothing at all, sir,' says I, 'only I wish I was safe home again.' ",3842,3910
39,"'Is it out of the island you want to go, Dan?' ",3910,3957
40,says he. ,3833,3842
41,"'It is, sir,' says I; ",3966,3988
42," so I up and told him how I had taken a drop too much, and fell into the water; ",3987,4067
43, how I swam to the island; ,4066,4093
44, and how I got into the bog and did not know my way out of it. ,4092,4155
45,"'Dan,' says he, after a minute's thought, 'though it is very improper of you to get drunk on a Lady-day, yet, as you are a decent sober man, who tends mass well, and never fling stones at me or mine, nor cries out after one in the field, my life for yours,' says he; ",4155,4422
46," 'so get up on my back, and grip me well for fear you'd fall off, and I'll fly you out of the bog.' ",4421,4521
47,"'I am afraid,' says I, 'your honour's making game of me; ",4521,4578
48, for whoever heard of riding a-horseback on an eagle before?' ,4577,4639
49,"'Upon the honour of a gentleman,' says he, putting his right foot on his breast, 'I am quite in earnest; ",4639,4744
50, and so now either take my offer or starve in the bog--besides I see that your weight is sinking the stone.' ,4743,4852
51,"It was true enough, as he said, for I found the stone every minute going from under me. ",4852,4940
52,I had no choice; ,4940,4957
53," so, thinks I to myself, faint heart never won fair lady, and this is fair persuadance. ",4956,5044
54,"'I thank your honour,' says I, 'for the loan of your civility; ",5044,5107
55, and I'll take your kind offer.' ,5106,5139
56,"I therefore mounted on the back of the eagle, and held him tight enough by the throat, and up he flew in the air like a lark. ",5139,5265
57,Little I knew the trick he was going to serve me. ,5265,5315
58,"Up, up, up--God knows how far he flew. ",5315,5354
59,"'Why, then,' said I to him--thinking he did not know the right road home--very civilly, because why? ",5354,5455
60,I was in his power entirely; ,5455,5484
61," 'sir,' says I, 'please your honour's glory, and with humble submission to your better judgment, if you'd fly down a bit, you're now just over my cabin, and I could be put down there, and many thanks to your worship.' ",5483,5701
62,"'Arrah, Dan,' says he, 'do you think me a fool? ",5701,5749
63,"Look down in the next field, and don't you see two men and a gun? ",5749,5815
64,"By my word, it would be no joke to shoot this way, to oblige a drunken blackguard that I picked up off a could stone in a bog.' ",5815,5943
65,"'Bother you,' says I to myself, but I did not speak out, for where was the use? ",5943,6023
66,"Well, sir, up he kept flying, flying, and I asking him every minute to fly down, and all to no use. ",6023,6123
67,"'Where in the world are you going, sir?' ",6123,6164
68,says I to him. ,6164,6179
69,"'Hold your tongue, Dan,' says he, 'and mind your own business, and don't be interfering with the business of other people.' ",6179,6303
70,"'Faith, this is my business, I think,' says I. ",6303,6350
71,"'Be quiet, Dan!' ",6350,6367
72,says he: so I said no more. ,6367,6395
73,"At last, where should we come to but to the moon itself. ",6395,6452
74,"Now, you can't see it from this, but there is, or there was in my time, a reaping-hook sticking out of the side of the moon, this way (drawing the figure thus on the ground with the end of his stick). ",6452,6653
75,"'Dan,' says the eagle, 'I'm tired with this long fly; ",6653,6707
76, I had no notion it was so far.' ,6706,6739
77,"'And my lord, sir,' says I, 'who in the world axed you to fly so far--was it I? ",6739,6819
78,Did not I beg and pray and beseech you to stop half an hour ago?' ,6819,6885
79,"'There's no use talking, Dan,' said he; ",6885,6925
80," 'I'm tired bad enough, so you must get off, and sit down on the moon until I rest myself.' ",6924,7016
81,'Is it sit down on the moon?' ,7016,7046
82,said I; ,7046,7054
83," 'is it upon that little round thing, then? ",7053,7097
84,"Why, then, sure, I'd fall off in a minute, and be kilt and spilt, and smashed all to bits; ",7097,7188
85, you are a vile deceiver--so you are.' ,7187,7226
86,"'Not at all, Dan,' says he; ",7226,7254
87," 'you can catch fast hold of the reaping-hook that's sticking out of the side of the moon, and it will keep you up.' ",7253,7370
88,"'I won't, then,' said I. ",7370,7395
89,"'Maybe not,' said he, quite quiet. ",7395,7430
90,"'If you don't, my man, I shall just give you a shake, and one slap of my wing, and send you down to the ground, where every bone in your body will be smashed as small as a drop of dew on a cabbage-leaf in the morning.' ",7430,7649
91,"'Why, then, I'm in a fine way,' said I to myself, 'ever to have come along with the likes of you';",7649,7747
92," and so, giving him a hearty curse in Irish, for fear he'd know what I said, I got off his back with a heavy heart, took hold of the reaping-hook and sat down upon the moon, and a mighty cold seat it was, I can tell you that. ",7747,7973
93,"When he had me there fairly landed, he turned about on me, and said, 'Good morning to you, Daniel O'Rourke,' said he; ",7973,8091
94, 'I think I've nicked you fairly now. ,8090,8128
95,"You robbed my nest last year' (it was true enough for him, but how he found it out is hard enough to say), 'and in return you are freely welcome to cool your heels dangling upon the moon like a cockthrow.' ",8128,8334
96,"'Is that all, and is this how you leave me, you brute, you,' says I. ",8334,8403
97,"'You ugly unnatural baste, and is this the way you serve me at last? ",8403,8472
98,"Bad luck to yourself, with your hook'd nose, and to all your breed, you blackguard.' ",8472,8557
99,It was all to no manner of use; ,8557,8589
100," he spread out his great big wings, burst out a laughing, and flew away like lightning. ",8588,8676
101,I bawled after him to stop; ,8676,8704
102," but I might have called and bawled for ever, without his minding me. ",8703,8773
103,"Away he went, and I never saw him from that day to this--sorrow fly away with him! ",8773,8856
104,"You may be sure I was in a disconsolate condition, and kept roaring out for the bare grief, when all at once a door opened right in the middle of the moon, creaking on its hinges as if it had not been opened for a month before--I suppose they never thought of greasing them--and out there walks--who do you think but the man in the moon himself? ",8856,9202
105,I knew him by his bush. ,9202,9226
106,"'Good morrow to you, Daniel O'Rourke,' says he, 'how do you do?' ",9226,9291
107,"'Very well, thank your honour,' says I. ",9291,9331
108,'I hope your honour's well.' ,9331,9360
109,"'What brought you here, Dan?' ",9360,9390
110,said he. ,9390,9399
111,"So I told him how I was a little overtaken in liquor at the master's, and how I was cast on a dissolute island, and how I lost my way in the bog, and the thief of an eagle promised to fly me out of it, and how, instead of that, he had fled me up to the moon. ",9399,9658
112,"'Dan,' said the man in the moon, taking a pinch of snuff, when I was done, 'you must not stay here.' ",9658,9759
113,"'Indeed, sir,' says I, 'it is much against my will that I'm here at all; ",9759,9832
114, but how am I to go back?' ,9831,9858
115,"'That's your business,' said he; ",9858,9891
116," 'Dan, mine is to tell you that you must not stay, so be off in less than no time.' ",9890,9974
117,"'I'm doing no harm,' said I, 'only holding on hard by the reaping-hook lest I fall off.' ",9974,10063
118,"'That's what you must not do, Dan,' says he. ",10063,10108
119,"'Pray, sir,' says I, 'may I ask how many you are in family that you would not give a poor traveller lodging? ",10108,10217
120,"I'm sure it is not often you're troubled with strangers coming to see you, for it is a long way.' ",10217,10315
121,"'I'm by myself, Dan,' says he, 'but you'd better let go the reaping-hook.' ",10315,10390
122,"'Faith, and with your leave,' says I, 'I'll not let go the grip, and the more you bids me the more I won't let go--so I will.' ",10390,10517
123,"'You had better, Dan,' says he again. ",10517,10555
124,"'Why, then, my little fellow,' says I, taking the whole weight of him with my eye from head to foot, 'there are two words to that bargain; ",10555,10694
125," and I'll not budge--you may, if you like.' ",10693,10737
126,"'We'll see how that is to be,' says he; ",10737,10777
127," and back he went, giving the door such a great bang after him (for it was plain he was huffed), that I thought the moon and all would fall down with it. ",10776,10930
128,"Well, I was preparing myself to try strength with him, when back he comes, with the kitchen cleaver in his hand, and without saying a word he gives two bangs to the handle of the reaping-hook that was holding me up, and whap it came in two. ",10930,11171
129,"'Good morning to you, Dan,' says the spiteful little blackguard, when he saw me cleanly falling down with a bit of the handle in my hand; ",11171,11309
130," 'I thank you for your visit, and fair weather after you, Daniel.' ",11308,11375
131,"I had no time to make any answer to him, for I was tumbling over and over, and rolling and rolling, at the rate of a fox-hunt. ",11375,11502
132,'God help me!' ,11502,11517
133,"says I, 'but this is a pretty pickle for a decent man to be seen in at this time of the night. ",11517,11612
134,I am now sold fairly.' ,11612,11635
135,"The word was not out of my mouth, when, whiz! ",11635,11681
136,"what should fly by close to my ear but a flock of wild geese, all the way from my own bog of Ballyasheenagh, else how should they know me? ",11681,11820
137,"The ould gander, who was their general, turning about his head, cried out to me, 'Is that you, Dan?' ",11820,11921
138,"'The same,' said I, not a bit daunted now at what he said, for I was by this time used to all kinds of bedivilment, and, besides, I knew him of ould. ",11921,12071
139,"'Good morrow to you,' says he, 'Daniel O'Rourke; ",12071,12120
140, how are you in health this morning?' ,12119,12157
141,"'Very well, sir,' says I, 'thank you kindly,' drawing my breath, for I was mightily in want of some, 'I hope your honour's the same.' ",12157,12291
142,"'I think it is falling you are, Daniel,' says he. ",12291,12341
143,"'You may say that, sir,' says I. ",12341,12374
144,'And where are you going all the way so fast?' ,12374,12421
145,said the gander. ,12421,12438
146,"So I told him how I had taken the drop, and how I came on the island, and how I lost my way in the bog, and how the thief of an eagle flew me up to the moon, and how the man in the moon turned me out. ",12438,12639
147,"'Dan,' said he, 'I'll save you; ",12639,12671
148," put out your hand and catch me by the leg, and I'll fly you home.' ",12670,12738
149,"'Sweet is your hand in a pitcher of honey, my jewel,' says I, though all the time I thought within myself that I don't much trust you; ",12738,12873
150," but there was no help, so I caught the gander by the leg, and away I and the other geese flew after him as fast as hops. ",12872,12994
151,"We flew, and we flew, and we flew, until we came right over the wide ocean. ",12994,13070
152,"I knew it well, for I saw Cape Clear to my right hand, sticking up out of the water. ",13070,13155
153,"'Ah, my lord,' said I to the goose, for I thought it best to keep a civil tongue in my head anyway, 'fly to land, if you please.' ",13155,13285
154,"'It is impossible, you see, Dan,' said he, 'for a while, because, you see, we are going to Arabia.' ",13285,13385
155,'To Arabia!' ,13385,13398
156,"said I, 'that's surely some place in foreign parts, far away. ",13398,13460
157,Oh! ,13460,13464
158,Mr. ,13464,13468
159,"Goose, why, then, to be sure, I'm a man to be pitied among you.' ",13468,13533
160,"'Whist, whist, you fool,' said he, 'hold your tongue; ",13533,13587
161," I tell you Arabia is a very decent sort of place, as like West Carbery as one egg is like another, only there is a little more sand there.' ",13586,13727
162,"Just as we were talking a ship hove in sight, sailing so beautiful before the wind. ",13727,13811
163,"'Ah, then, sir,' said I, 'will you drop me on the ship, if you please?' ",13811,13883
164,"'We are not fair over it,' said he; ",13883,13919
165, 'if I dropped you now you would go splash into the sea.' ,13918,13976
166,"'I would not,' says I, 'I know better than that, for it is just clean under us, so let me drop now at once.' ",13976,14085
167,"'If you must, you must,' said he; ",14085,14119
168," 'there, take your own way';",14118,14146
169," and he opened his claw, and, faith, he was right--sure enough, I came down plump into the very bottom of the salt sea! ",14146,14266
170,"Down to the very bottom I went, and I gave myself up, then, for ever, when a whale walked up to me, scratching himself after his night's sleep, and looked me full in the face, and never the word did he say, but, lifting up his tail, he splashed me all over again with the cold salt water till there wasn't a dry stitch upon my whole carcass! ",14266,14608
171,"And I heard somebody saying--it was a voice I knew too--'Get up, you drunken brute, off of that';",14608,14705
172," and with that I woke up, and there was Judy with a tub full of water, which she was splashing all over me--for, rest her soul, though she was a good wife, she could never bear to see me in drink, and had a bitter hand of her own. ",14705,14936
173,"'Get up,' said she again; ",14936,14962
174," 'and of all places in the parish, would no place sarve your turn to lie down upon but under the ould walls of Carrigapooka? ",14961,15086
175,An uneasy resting I am sure you had of it.' ,15086,15130
176,"And, sure enough, I had, for I was fairly bothered out of my senses with eagles, and men of the moons, and flying ganders, and whales, driving me through bogs and up to the moon, and down to the bottom of the green ocean. ",15130,15352
177,"If I was in drink ten times over, long would it be before I'd lie down in the same spot again, I know that!",15352,15460
