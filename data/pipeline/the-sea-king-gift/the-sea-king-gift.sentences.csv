0,"There was once a fisherman who was called Salmon, and his Christian name was Matte. ",0,84
1,He lived by the shore of the big sea; ,84,122
2, where else could he live? ,121,148
3,He had a wife called Maie; ,148,175
4, could you find a better name for her? ,174,213
5,"In winter they dwelt in a little cottage by the shore, but in spring they flitted to a red rock out in the sea and stayed there the whole summer until it was autumn. ",213,379
6,The cottage on the rock was even smaller than the other; ,379,436
7," it had a wooden bolt instead of an iron lock to the door, a stone hearth, a flagstaff, and a weather-cock on the roof. ",435,555
8,"The rock was called Ahtola, and was not larger than the market-place of a town. ",555,635
9,Between the crevices there grew a little rowan tree and four alder bushes. ,635,710
10,Heaven only knows how they ever came there; ,710,754
11, perhaps they were brought by the winter storms. ,753,802
12,"Besides that, there flourished some tufts of velvety grass, some scattered reeds, two plants of the yellow herb called tansy, four of a red flower, and a pretty white one; ",802,974
13," but the treasures of the rock consisted of three roots of garlic, which Maie had put in a cleft. ",973,1071
14,"Rock walls sheltered them on the north side, and the sun shone on them on the south. ",1071,1156
15,"This does not seem much, but it sufficed Maie for a herb plot. ",1156,1219
16,"All good things go in threes, so Matte and his wife fished for salmon in spring, for herring in summer, and for cod in winter. ",1219,1346
17,"When on Saturdays the weather was fine and the wind favourable, they sailed to the nearest town, sold their fish, and went to church on Sunday. ",1346,1490
18,"But it often happened that for weeks at a time they were quite alone on the rock Ahtola, and had nothing to look at except their little yellow-brown dog, which bore the grand name of Prince, their grass tufts, their bushes and blooms, the sea bays and fish, a stormy sky and the blue, white-crested waves. ",1490,1796
19,"For the rock lay far away from the land, and there were no green islets or human habitations for miles round, only here and there appeared a rock of the same red stone as Ahtola, besprinkled day and night with the ocean spray. ",1796,2023
20,"Matte and Maie were industrious, hard-working folk, happy and contented in their poor hut, and they thought themselves rich when they were able to salt as many casks of fish as they required for winter and yet have some left over with which to buy tobacco for the old man, and a pound or two of coffee for his wife, with plenty of burned corn and chicory in it to give it a flavour. ",2023,2406
21,"Besides that, they had bread, butter, fish, a beer cask, and a buttermilk jar; ",2406,2485
22, what more did they require? ,2484,2513
23,All would have gone well had not Maie been possessed with a secret longing which never let her rest; ,2513,2614
24," and this was, how she could manage to become the owner of a cow. ",2613,2679
25,'What would you do with a cow?' ,2679,2711
26,asked Matte. ,2711,2724
27,"'She could not swim so far, and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here; ",2724,2809
28," and even if we had her, we have nothing to feed her on.' ",2808,2866
29,"'We have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass,' rejoined Maie. ",2866,2937
30,"'Yes, of course,' laughed Matte, 'and we have also three plants of garlic. ",2937,3012
31,Garlic would be fine feeding for her.' ,3012,3051
32,"'Every cow likes salt herring,' rejoined his wife. ",3051,3102
33,'Even Prince is fond of fish.' ,3102,3133
34,"'That may be,' said her husband. ",3133,3166
35,'Methinks she would soon be a dear cow if we had to feed her on salt herring. ,3166,3244
36,"All very well for Prince, who fights with the gulls over the last morsel. ",3244,3318
37,"Put the cow out of your head, mother, we are very well off as we are.' ",3318,3389
38,Maie sighed. ,3389,3402
39,"She knew well that her husband was right, but she could not give up the idea of a cow. ",3402,3489
40,The buttermilk no longer tasted as good as usual in the coffee; ,3489,3553
41," she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter, and of how there was nothing in the world to be compared with them. ",3552,3666
42,"One day as Matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore they heard Prince barking, and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat with three young men in it, steering towards the rock. ",3666,3858
43,"They were students, on a boating excursion, and wanted to get something to eat. ",3858,3938
44,"'Bring us a junket, good mother,' cried they to Maie. ",3938,3992
45,'Ah! ,3992,3997
46,if only I had such a thing!' ,3997,4026
47,sighed Maie. ,4026,4039
48,"'A can of fresh milk, then,' said the students; ",4039,4087
49, 'but it must not be skim.' ,4086,4114
50,"'Yes, if only I had it!' ",4114,4139
51,"sighed the old woman, still more deeply. ",4139,4180
52,'What! ,4180,4187
53,haven't you got a cow?' ,4187,4211
54,Maie was silent. ,4211,4228
55,This question so struck her to the heart that she could not reply. ,4228,4295
56,"'We have no cow,' Matte answered; ",4295,4329
57," 'but we have good smoked herring, and can cook them in a couple of hours.' ",4328,4404
58,"'All right, then, that will do,' said the students, as they flung themselves down on the rock, while fifty silvery-white herring were turning on the spit in front of the fire. ",4404,4580
59,'What's the name of this little stone in the middle of the ocean?' ,4580,4647
60,asked one of them. ,4647,4666
61,"'Ahtola,' answered the old man. ",4666,4698
62,"'Well, you should want for nothing when you live in the Sea King's dominion.' ",4698,4776
63,Matte did not understand. ,4776,4802
64,"He had never read Kalevala and knew nothing of the sea gods of old, but the students proceeded to explain to him. ",4802,4916
65,"'Ahti,' said they, 'is a mighty king who lives in his dominion of Ahtola, and has a rock at the bottom of the sea, and possesses besides a treasury of good things. ",4916,5080
66,He rules over all fish and animals of the deep; ,5080,5128
67, he has the finest cows and the swiftest horses that ever chewed grass at the bottom of the ocean. ,5127,5226
68,"He who stands well with Ahti is soon a rich man, but one must beware in dealing with him, for he is very changeful and touchy. ",5226,5353
69,"Even a little stone thrown into the water might offend him, and then as he takes back his gift, he stirs up the sea into a storm and drags the sailors down into the depths. ",5353,5526
70,"Ahti owns also the fairest maidens, who bear the train of his queen Wellamos, and at the sound of music they comb their long, flowing locks, which glisten in the water.' ",5526,5696
71,'Oh!' ,5696,5702
72,"cried Matte, 'have your worships really seen all that?' ",5702,5758
73,"'We have as good as seen it,' said the students. ",5758,5807
74,"'It is all printed in a book, and everything printed is true.' ",5807,5870
75,"'I'm not so sure of that,' said Matte, as he shook his head. ",5870,5931
76,"But the herring were now ready, and the students ate enough for six, and gave Prince some cold meat which they happened to have in the boat. ",5931,6072
77,Prince sat on his hind legs with delight and mewed like a pussy cat. ,6072,6141
78,"When all was finished, the students handed Matte a shining silver coin, and allowed him to fill his pipe with a special kind of tobacco. ",6141,6278
79,"They then thanked him for his kind hospitality and went on their journey, much regretted by Prince, who sat with a woeful expression and whined on the shore as long as he could see a flip of the boat's white sail in the distance. ",6278,6508
80,"Maie had never uttered a word, but thought the more. ",6508,6561
81,"She had good ears, and had laid to heart the story about Ahti. ",6561,6624
82,"'How delightful,' thought she to herself, 'to possess a fairy cow! ",6624,6691
83,"How delicious every morning and evening to draw milk from it, and yet have no trouble about the feeding, and to keep a shelf near the window for dishes of milk and junkets! ",6691,6864
84,But this will never be my luck.' ,6864,6897
85,'What are you thinking of?' ,6897,6925
86,asked Matte. ,2711,2724
87,"'Nothing,' said his wife; ",6938,6964
88," but all the time she was pondering over some magic rhymes she had heard in her childhood from an old lame man, which were supposed to bring luck in fishing. ",6963,7121
89,'What if I were to try?' ,7121,7146
90,thought she. ,7146,7159
91,"Now this was Saturday, and on Saturday evenings Matte never set the herring-net, for he did not fish on Sunday. ",7159,7271
92,"Towards evening, however, his wife said: 'Let us set the herring-net just this once.' ",7271,7357
93,"'No,' said her husband, 'it is a Saturday night.' ",7357,7407
94,"'Last night was so stormy, and we caught so little,' urged his wife; ",7407,7476
95," 'to-night the sea is like a mirror, and with the wind in this direction the herring are drawing towards land.' ",7475,7587
96,"'But there are streaks in the north-western sky, and Prince was eating grass this evening,' said the old man. ",7587,7697
97,"'Surely he has not eaten my garlic,' exclaimed the old woman. ",7697,7759
98,'No; ,7759,7764
99," but there will be rough weather by to-morrow at sunset,' rejoined Matte. ",7763,7837
100,"'Listen to me,' said his wife, 'we will set only one net close to the shore, and then we shall be able to finish up our half-filled cask, which will spoil if it stands open so long.' ",7837,8020
101,"The old man allowed himself to be talked over, and so they rowed out with the net. ",8020,8103
102,"When they reached the deepest part of the water, she began to hum the words of the magic rhyme, altering the words to suit the longing of her heart: Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard, Who dwellest in the deep blue sea, Finest treasures have I heard, And glittering fish belong to thee. ",8103,8391
103,"The richest pearls beyond compare, Are stored up in thy realm below, And Ocean's cows so sleek and fair, Feed on the grass in thy green meadow. ",8391,8535
104,"King of the waters, far and near, I ask not of thy golden store, I wish not jewels of pearl to wear, Nor silver either, ask I for, But one is odd and even is two, So give me a cow, sea-king so bold, And in return I'll give to you, A slice of the moon, and the sun's gold. ",8535,8807
105,'What's that you're humming?' ,8807,8837
106,asked the old man. ,8837,8856
107,"'Oh, only the words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head,' answered the old woman; ",8856,8948
108," and she raised her voice and went on: Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard, Who dwellest in the deep blue sea, A thousand cows are in thy herd, I pray thee give one onto me. ",8947,9121
109,"'That's a stupid sort of song,' said Matte. ",9121,9165
110,'What else should one beg of the sea-king but fish? ,9165,9217
111,But such songs are not for Sunday.' ,9217,9253
112,"His wife pretended not to hear him, and sang and sang the same tune all the time they were on the water. ",9253,9358
113,"Matte heard nothing more as he sat and rowed the heavy boat, while thinking of his cracked pipe and the fine tobacco. ",9358,9476
114,"Then they returned to the island, and soon after went to bed. ",9476,9538
115,But neither Matte nor Maie could sleep a wink; ,9538,9585
116," the one thought of how he had profaned Sunday, and the other of Ahti's cow. ",9584,9661
117,"About midnight the fisherman sat up, and said to his wife: 'Dost thou hear anything?' ",9661,9747
118,"'No,' said she. ",9747,9763
119,"'I think the twirling of the weathercock on the roof bodes ill,' said he; ",9763,9837
120, 'we shall have a storm.' ,9836,9862
121,"'Oh, it is nothing but your fancy,' said his wife. ",9862,9913
122,"Matte lay down, but soon rose again. ",9913,9950
123,"'The weathercock is squeaking now,' said he. ",9950,9995
124,'Just fancy! ,9995,10008
125,"Go to sleep,' said his wife; ",10008,10037
126, and the old man tried to. ,10036,10063
127,For the third time he jumped out of bed. ,10063,10104
128,'Ho! ,10104,10109
129,"how the weather-cock is roaring at the pitch of its voice, as if it had a fire inside it! ",10109,10199
130,"We are going to have a tempest, and must bring in the net.' ",10199,10259
131,Both rose. ,10259,10270
132,"The summer night was as dark as if it had been October, the weather-cock creaked, and the storm was raging in every direction. ",10270,10397
133,"As they went out the sea lay around them as white as now, and the spray was dashing right over the fisher-hut. ",10397,10508
134,In all his life Matte had never remembered such a night. ,10508,10565
135,To launch the boat and put to sea to rescue the net was a thing not to be thought of. ,10565,10651
136,"The fisherman and his wife stood aghast on the doorstep, holding on fast by the doorpost, while the foam splashed over their faces. ",10651,10783
137,'Did I not tell thee that there is no luck in Sunday fishing?' ,10783,10846
138,said Matte sulkily; ,10846,10866
139, and his wife was so frightened that she never even once thought of Ahti's cows. ,10865,10946
140,"As there was nothing to be done, they went in. ",10946,10993
141,"Their eyes were heavy for lack of slumber, and they slept as soundly as if there had not been such a thing as an angry sea roaring furiously around their lonely dwelling. ",10993,11164
142,"When they awoke, the sun was high in the heavens, the tempest had cased, and only the swell of the sea rose in silvery heavings against the red rock. ",11164,11314
143,'What can that be?' ,11314,11334
144,"said the old woman, as she peeped out of the door. ",11334,11385
145,"'It looks like a big seal,' said Matte. ",11385,11425
146,"'As sure as I live, it's a cow!' ",11425,11458
147,exclaimed Maie. ,11458,11474
148,"And certainly it was a cow, a fine red cow, fat and flourishing, and looking as if it had been fed all its days on spinach. ",11474,11598
149,"It wandered peacefully up and down the shore, and never so much as even looked at the poor little tufts of grass, as if it despised such fare. ",11598,11741
150,Matte could not believe his eyes. ,11741,11775
151,"But a cow she seemed, and a cow she was found to be; ",11775,11828
152," and when the old woman began to milk her, every pitcher and pan, even to the baler, was soon filled with the most delicious milk. ",11827,11958
153,"The old man troubled his head in vain as to how she came there, and sallied forth to seek for his lost net. ",11958,12066
154,"He had not proceeded far when he found it cast up on the shore, and so full of fish that not a mesh was visible. ",12066,12179
155,"'It is all very fine to possess a cow,' said Matte, as he cleaned the fish; ",12179,12255
156, 'but what are we going to feed her on?' ,12254,12295
157,"'We shall find some means,' said his wife; ",12295,12338
158, and the cow found the means herself. ,12337,12375
159,"She went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in great abundance near the shore, and always kept in good condition. ",12375,12493
160,"Every one Prince alone excepted, thought she was a clever beast; ",12493,12558
161," but Prince barked at her, for he had now got a rival. ",12557,12612
162,"From that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets, and every net was filled with fish. ",12612,12709
163,"Matte and Maie grew fat on this fine living, and daily became richer. ",12709,12779
164,"She churned quantities of butter, and he hired two men to help him in his fishing. ",12779,12862
165,"The sea lay before him like a big fish tank, out of which he hauled as many as he required; ",12862,12954
166, and the cow continued to fend for herself. ,12953,12997
167,"In autumn, when Matte and Maie went ashore, the cow went to sea, and in spring, when they returned to the rock, there she stood awaiting them. ",12997,13140
168,"'We shall require a better house,' said Maie the following summer; ",13140,13207
169, 'the old one is too small for ourselves and the men.' ,13206,13261
170,"'Yes,' said Matte. ",13261,13280
171,"So he built a large cottage, with a real lock to the door, and a store-house for fish as well; ",13280,13375
172," and he and his men caught such quantities of fish that they sent tons of salmon, herring, and cod to Russian and Sweden. ",13374,13496
173,"'I am quite overworked with so many folk,' said Maie; ",13496,13550
174, 'a girl to help me would not come amiss.' ,13549,13592
175,"'Get one, then,' said her husband; ",13592,13627
176, and so they hired a girl. ,13626,13653
177,Then Maie said: 'We have too little milk for all these folk. ,13653,13714
178,"Now that I have a servant, with the same amount of trouble she could look after three cows.' ",13714,13807
179,"'All right, then,' said her husband, somewhat provoked, 'you can sing a song to the fairies.' ",13807,13901
180,"This annoyed Maie, but nevertheless she rowed out to sea on Sunday night and sang as before: Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard, Who dwellest in the deep blue sea, A thousand cows are in thy herd, I pray thee give three unto me. ",13901,14131
181,"The following morning, instead of one, three cows stood on the island, and they all ate seaweed and fended for themselves like the first one. ",14131,14273
182,'Art thou satisfied now?' ,14273,14299
183,said Matte to his wife. ,14299,14323
184,"'I should be quite satisfied,' said his wife, 'if only I had two servants to help, and if I had some finer clothes. ",14323,14439
185,Don't you know that I am addressed as Madam?' ,14439,14485
186,"'Well, well,' said her husband. ",14485,14517
187,So Maie got several servants and clothes fit for a great lady. ,14517,14580
188,'Everything would now be perfect if only we had a little better dwelling for summer. ,14580,14665
189,"You might build us a two-storey house, and fetch soil to make a garden. ",14665,14737
190,Then you might make a little arbour up there to let us have a sea-view; ,14737,14809
191," and we might have a fiddler to fiddle to us of an evening, and a little steamer to take us to church in stormy weather.' ",14808,14930
192,'Anything more?' ,14930,14947
193,asked Matte; ,14947,14960
194, but he did everything that his wife wished. ,14959,15004
195,The rock Ahtola became so grand and Maie so grand that all the sea-urchins and herring were lost in wonderment. ,15004,15116
196,Even Prince was fed on beefsteaks and cream scones till at last he was as round as a butter jar. ,15116,15213
197,'Are you satisfied now?' ,15213,15238
198,asked Matte. ,2711,2724
199,"'I should be quite satisfied,' said Maie, 'if only I had thirty cows. ",15251,15321
200,At least that number is required for such a household.' ,15321,15377
201,"'Go to the fairies,' said Matte. ",15377,15410
202,His wife set out in the new steamer and sang to the sea-king. ,15410,15472
203,"Next morning thirty cows stood on the shore, all finding food for themselves. ",15472,15550
204,"'Know'st thou, good man, that we are far too cramped on this wretched rock, and where am I to find room for so many cows?' ",15550,15673
205,'There is nothing to be done but to pump out the sea.' ,15673,15728
206,'Rubbish!' ,15728,15739
207,said his wife. ,9898,9913
208,'Who can pump out the sea?' ,15754,15782
209,"'Try with thy new steamer, there is a pump in it.' ",15782,15833
210,"Maie knew well that her husband was only making fun of her, but still her mind was set upon the same subject. ",15833,15943
211,"'I never could pump the sea out,' thought she, 'but perhaps I might fill it up, if I were to make a big dam. ",15943,16052
212,"I might heap up sand and stones, and make our island as big again.' ",16052,16120
213,Maie loaded her boat with stones and went out to sea. ,16120,16174
214,"The fiddler was with her, and fiddled so finely that Ahti and Wellamos and all the sea's daughters rose to the surface of the water to listen to the music. ",16174,16330
215,'What is that shining so brightly in the waves?' ,16330,16379
216,asked Maie. ,16379,16391
217,"'That is sea foam glinting in the sunshine,' answered the fiddler. ",16391,16458
218,"'Throw out the stones,' said Maie. ",16458,16493
219,"The people in the boat began to throw out the stones, splash, splash, right and left, into the foam. ",16493,16594
220,"One stone hit the nose of Wellamos's chief lady-in-waiting, another scratched the sea queen herself on the cheek, a third plumped close to Ahti's head and tore off half of the sea-king's beard; ",16594,16788
221," then there was a commotion in the sea, the waves bubbled and bubbled like boiling water in a pot 'Whence comes this gust of wind?' ",16787,16919
222,said Maie; ,13539,13550
223, and as she spoke the sea opened and swallowed up the steamer. ,16929,16992
224,"Maie sank to the bottom like a stone, but, stretching out her arms and legs, she rose to the surface, where she found the fiddler's fiddle, and used it as a float. ",16992,17156
225,"At the same moment she saw close beside her the terrible head of Ahti, and he had only half a beard! ",17156,17257
226,'Why did you throw stones at me?' ,17257,17291
227,roared the sea-king. ,17291,17312
228,"'Oh, your majesty, it was a mistake! ",17312,17349
229,Put some bear's grease on your beard and that will soon make it grow again.' ,17349,17426
230,"'Dame, did I not give you all you asked for--nay, even more?' ",17426,17488
