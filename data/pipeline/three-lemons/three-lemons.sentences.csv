0,"Once upon a time there were three brothers who had lost their parents, and since the latter had left their sons nothing upon which to live, they had to wander out into the world, and seek their fortune. ",0,203
1,The two older brothers prepared for the journey as well as they were able; ,203,278
2," but the youngest, whom they called ""Mike by the Stove,"" because he was always sitting behind the stove whittling, they did not want to take with them. ",277,429
3,So they set out at early dawn; ,429,460
4, yet for all their hurrying Mike by the Stove reached the king's court as soon as they did. ,459,551
5,"When they got there, they asked to be taken into the king's service. ",551,620
6,"Well, said the king, he really had no work for them to do; ",620,679
7," but since they were so poor, he would see that they were kept busy; ",678,747
8," there was always something or other to do in such a big establishment: they could drive nails into the wall, and when they were through, they could pull them out again. ",746,916
9,"And when that was done, they could carry wood and water into the kitchen. ",916,990
10,"Mike by the Stove was quickest at driving his nails into the wall, and pulling them out again, and he had been quick, too, about carrying his wood and water. ",990,1148
11,"Therefore his brothers grew jealous, and said he had declared he could obtain the most beautiful princess in twelve kingdoms for the king--for the king's wife had died and he was a widower. ",1148,1338
12,"When the king heard this, he told Mike by the Stove he had better do as he had said, else he would have him brought to the block, and his head chopped off. ",1338,1494
13,Mike by the Stove replied that he had neither said nor thought anything of the kind; ,1494,1579
14," but that seeing the king was so severe, he would try it. ",1578,1636
15,So he took a knapsack full of food and set out. ,1636,1684
16,"But he had only pushed a little way into the wood before he grew hungry, and thought he would sample the provisions they had given him at the king's castle. ",1684,1841
17,"When he had sat down in all peace and comfort under a pine-tree by the side of the road, an old woman came limping along, and asked him what he had in his knapsack. ",1841,2006
18,"""Meat and bacon, granny,"" said the youth. ",2006,2048
19,"""If you are hungry, come and share with me!"" ",2048,2093
20,"She thanked him, satisfied her hunger, and then telling him she would do him a favor in turn, limped off into the wood. ",2093,2213
21,"When Mike by the Stove had eaten his fill, he slung his knapsack across his shoulder once more, and went his way; ",2213,2327
22, but he had only gone a short distance before he found a whistle. ,2326,2392
23,"That would be fine, thought he, to have a whistle, and be able to whistle himself a tune while he traveled, and before long he really succeeded in making it sound. ",2392,2556
24,"That very moment the wood was alive with dwarfs, all of them asking with one voice: ""What are my lord's commands? ",2556,2670
25,"What are my lord's commands?"" ",2670,2700
26,Mike by the Stove said he did not know he was their lord; ,2700,2758
27," but if he had any command to give, he would ask them to bring him the fairest princess in twelve kingdoms. ",2757,2865
28,"That would be easy enough, said the dwarfs; ",2865,2909
29," they knew exactly who she was, and they could show him the way; ",2908,2973
30," then he himself could go and fetch her, since the dwarfs were powerless to touch her. ",2972,3059
31,"They showed him the way, and he reached his goal quickly and without trouble, for no one interfered with him. ",3059,3169
32,"It was a troll's castle, and in it were three beautiful princesses; ",3169,3237
33," but when Mike by the Stove stepped in, they acted as though they had lost their wits, ran around like frightened lambs, and finally turned into three lemons that lay on the window-ledge. ",3236,3424
34,"Mike by the Stove was in despair, and very unhappy because he did not know what to do. ",3424,3511
35,"But after he had reflected a while, he took the three lemons, and put them in his pocket; ",3511,3601
36," because, thought he, he might be glad he had done so should he grow thirsty during his journey, for he had heard that lemons were sour. ",3600,3737
37,"After he had traveled a way, he grew very warm and thirsty. ",3737,3797
38,"There was no water to be found, and he did not know how he was to refresh himself. ",3797,3880
39,"Then the lemons occurred to him, and he took one and bit into it. ",3880,3946
40,"But in it sat a princess, visible up to her arms, and cried: ""Water, water!"" ",3946,4023
41,"If she could not have some water, said she, she must die. ",4023,4081
42,"The youth ran about everywhere like mad, looking for water; ",4081,4141
43," but there was no water there, and none to be found, and when he returned she was dead. ",4140,4228
44,"After he had gone on again a while, he grew still more thirsty, and since he found nothing with which to refresh himself, he took another lemon and bit into it. ",4228,4389
45,"And another princess looked out, up to her shoulders, and she was even more beautiful than the first. ",4389,4491
46,"She cried for water, and said that if she could not have some water she must die on the spot. ",4491,4585
47,Mike by the Stove ran about and looked under stones and moss; ,4585,4647
48," but he found no water, so this princess also died. ",4646,4698
49,"Mike by the Stove thought that things were going from bad to worse, and this was the truth, since the further he went the warmer it grew. ",4698,4836
50,"The part of the country in which he was traveling was so parched and dried that not a drop of water was to be found, and he was half-dead with thirst. ",4836,4987
51,For a long time he hesitated before biting into the last lemon; ,4987,5051
52, but at last there was nothing else left to do. ,5050,5098
53,"When he had bitten into it, a princess looked out: she was the most beautiful in twelve kingdoms, and she cried that if she could have no water, she must die on the spot. ",5098,5269
54,"Mike by the Stove ran about and looked for water, and this time he met the king's miller, who showed him the way to the mill-pond. ",5269,5400
55,"When he had come with her to the mill-pond, and had given her water, she came completely out of the lemon. ",5400,5507
56,"But she had nothing to wear, and Mike by the Stove had to give her his smock. ",5507,5585
57,"She put it on, and hid in a tree; ",5585,5619
58," while he was to go to the castle and bring her clothes, and tell the king he had found her, and how it had all happened. ",5618,5740
59,Meanwhile the cook had come down to the pond to fetch water. ,5740,5801
60,"When she saw the lovely face that was reflected in the pond, she thought it was her own, and was so pleased that she began to dance and jump around, because she had grown so beautiful. ",5801,5986
61,"""Let the devil fetch the water, I'm far too handsome to bother with it!"" ",5986,6059
62,"said she, and threw away the water-pail. ",6059,6100
63,And then she suddenly noticed that the face in the water was that of the princess who sat in the tree. ,6100,6203
64,"This made her so angry that she pulled her down from the tree, and threw her into the pond. ",6203,6295
65,"Then she herself put on Mike by the Stove's smock, and climbed into the tree. ",6295,6373
66,"When the king arrived, and saw the swart, homely kitchen-maid, he grew red and white in turn; ",6373,6467
67," but when he heard the people say she was the greatest beauty in twelve kingdoms, he had to believe, willy-nilly, that there was something in it, and he did not want to be unjust to Mike by the Stove, who had taken so much trouble to find her. ",6466,6710
68,"She might grow more beautiful in time, thought he, if she were adorned with jewels, and dressed in fine clothes, and so he took her home with him. ",6710,6857
69,"Then they sent for wig-makers and seamstresses, and she was adorned and dressed like a princess; ",6857,6954
70," but for all their washing and bedizening, she remained swart and homely. ",6953,7027
71,"After a while, when the kitchen-maid had to go to the pond to fetch water, she caught a great silver fish in her pail. ",7027,7146
72,"She carried it up and showed it to the king, who thought it was a beauty; ",7146,7220
73," but the homely princess declared it to be the work of witches, and that they were to burn it, for she had noticed at once what it was. ",7219,7355
74,"So the following morning the fish was burned, and they found a lump of silver in the ashes. ",7355,7447
75,"Then the cook went up and told the king, and he thought it very strange; ",7447,7520
76," but the princess said it was witchcraft pure and simple, and that they were to bury the silver under the manure-pile. ",7519,7638
77,"The king did not want to, but she gave him no peace until he consented, and finally said they were to do so. ",7638,7747
78,"But on the following day a beautiful linden-tree stood where they had buried the lump of silver, and the leaves of the linden-tree glistened like silver, too. ",7747,7906
79,When they told the king he thought it remarkable; ,7906,7956
80," but the princess said it was no more nor less than witchcraft, and that the linden-tree must be cut down. ",7955,8062
81,This the king did not wish done at all; ,8062,8102
82, but the princess tormented him so that finally he yielded in this as well. ,8101,8177
83,"When the maids went out and brought wood for the fire from the linden-tree, it was pure silver. ",8177,8273
84,"""We need not tell the king and the princess anything about it,"" said one of them, ""for they would only burn it up and melt it down. ",8273,8405
85,Let us keep it in the wardrobe instead. ,8405,8445
86,"It might be very useful to us some day, if some one comes along, and we want to marry."" ",8445,8533
87,"They were all of the same mind, but when they had carried the wood a while, it grew terribly heavy. ",8533,8633
88,"And when they looked to see why this was, the sticks of wood had turned into a little child, and before long she had become the most beautiful princess imaginable. ",8633,8797
89,"The maids saw that there was some hocus-pocus about it, gave her clothes, ran off to fetch the youth who had been sent to find the most beautiful princess in twelve kingdoms, and told him their story. ",8797,8998
90,"And when Mike by the Stove arrived, the princess explained to him how everything had happened, that the cook had thrown her into the pond, and that she had been the silver fish, the lump of silver, and the linden-tree, and the sticks of wood, and that she was the true princess. ",8998,9277
91,"It was hard to get at the king, for the swart, homely cook was with him early and late; ",9277,9365
92," but at last they decided to tell him that a declaration of war had come from a neighboring monarch, and so they got him out. ",9364,9490
93,"When he saw the beautiful princess, he fell so deeply in love with her that he wanted to marry her out of hand, and when he heard how badly the swart, homely cook had treated her, the latter was promptly punished. ",9490,9704
94,Then they held a wedding that was heard of and talked about in twelve kingdoms.,9704,9784
