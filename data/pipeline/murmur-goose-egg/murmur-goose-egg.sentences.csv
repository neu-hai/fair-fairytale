0,"ONCE upon a time there were five women who were standing in a field, mowing. ",0,77
1,"Heaven had not given a single one of them a child, and each of them wanted to have one. ",77,165
2,"And suddenly they saw a goose-egg of quite unheard-of size, well-nigh as large as a man's head. ",165,261
3,"""I saw it first,"" said the one. ",261,293
4,"""I saw it at the same time that you did,"" insisted another. ",293,353
5,"""But I want it, for I saw it first of all,"" maintained a third. ",353,417
6,"And thus they went on, and fought so about the egg that they nearly came to blows. ",417,500
7,"Finally they agreed that it should belong to all five of them, and that all of them should sit on it, as a goose would do, and hatch out the little gosling. ",500,657
8,"The first remained sitting on the egg for eight days, and hatched, and did not move or do a thing. ",657,756
9,During this time the rest had to feed her and themselves as well. ,756,822
10,One of them grew angry because of this and scolded. ,822,874
11,"""You did not crawl out of the egg either before you could cry peep!"" ",874,943
12,said the one who was sitting on the egg and hatching. ,943,997
13,"""Yet I almost believe that a human child is going to slip out of the egg, for something is murmuring inside it without ever stopping: Herring and mush, porridge and milk,"" said she. ",997,1179
14,"""And now you can sit on it for eight days, while we bring you food."" ",1179,1248
15,"When the fifth day of the eight had passed, it was plain to her that there was a child in the egg, which kept on calling: ""Herring and mush, porridge and milk,"" and so she punched a hole in the egg. ",1248,1447
16,Instead of a gosling out came a child. ,1447,1486
17,"It was quite disgustingly homely, with a big head and a small body. ",1486,1554
18,"No sooner had it crawled out than it began to cry: ""Herring and mush, porridge and milk!"" ",1554,1644
19,So they named the child Murmur Goose-Egg. ,1644,1686
20,"In spite of the child's homeliness, the women at first took a great deal of pleasure in him. ",1686,1779
21,"But before long, he grew so greedy that he devoured everything they had. ",1779,1852
22,"When they cooked a dish of mush or a potful of porridge that was to do for all six of them, the child swallowed it all by himself. ",1852,1983
23,So they did not want to keep him any longer. ,1983,2028
24,"""I have not had a single full meal since the changling crawled out,"" said one of them. ",2028,2115
25,"When Murmur Goose-Egg heard that, and the rest agreed, he said that he would gladly go his own gait, for ""if they had no need of him, then he had no need of them,"" and with that he went off. ",2115,2306
26,"Finally he came to a farmstead that lay in a rocky section, and asked for work. ",2306,2386
27,"Yes, they needed a workman, and the master told him to gather up the stones in the field. ",2386,2476
28,Then Murmur Goose-Egg gathered up the stones in the field. ,2476,2535
29,"He picked up some that were so large that a number of horses could not have dragged them, and large and small, one and all, he put them in his pocket. ",2535,2686
30,"Before long he had finished his work, and wanted to know what he was to do next. ",2686,2767
31,"""You have picked up the stones in the field?"" ",2767,2813
32,said his master. ,2813,2830
33,"""You cannot possibly have finished before you have really begun!"" ",2830,2896
34,"But Murmur Goose-Egg emptied his pockets, and threw the stones on a pile. ",2896,2970
35,"Then his master saw that he had finished his work, and that one would have to handle such a strong fellow with kid gloves. ",2970,3093
36,So he told him to come in and eat. ,3093,3128
37,"That suited Murmur Goose-Egg, and he ate up everything that was to have supplied the master and his family, and the help, and then he was only half satisfied. ",3128,3287
38,He was really a splendid worker; ,3287,3320
39," but a dangerous eater, like a bottomless cask, said the peasant. ",3319,3385
40,"""Such a serving-man could eat up a poor peasant, house and ground, before he noticed it,"" said he. ",3385,3484
41,"He had no more work for him, and the best thing to do would be to go to the king's castle. ",3484,3575
42,"So Murmur Goose-Egg went to the king, and was at once given a place, and there was enough to eat and drink in the castle. ",3575,3697
43,"He was to be the errand-boy, and help the maids fetch wood and water, and do other odd jobs. ",3697,3790
44,So he asked what he was to do first. ,3790,3827
45,"For the time being he could chop fire-wood, said they. ",3827,3882
46,"So Murmur Goose-Egg began to chop fire-wood, and hewed to the line in such fashion that the chips fairly flew. ",3882,3993
47,"Before long he had chopped up all that there was, kindling wood and building wood, beams and boards, and when he was through with it, he came and asked what he was to do now. ",3993,4168
48,"""You can finish chopping the fire-wood,"" said they. ",4168,4220
49,"""There is none left,"" said Murmur Goose-Egg. ",4220,4265
50,"That could not be possible, said the superintendent, and looked into the wood-bin. ",4265,4348
51,"Yes, indeed, Murmur Goose-Egg had chopped up everything, large and small, beams and boards. ",4348,4440
52,That was very bad. ,4440,4459
53,Therefore the superintendent said that Murmur Goose-Egg should have nothing to eat until he had chopped down just as much wood in the forest as he had just chopped up for fire-wood. ,4459,4641
54,"Then Murmur Goose-Egg went into the smithy, and had the smith make an iron ax of five hundred-weights. ",4641,4744
55,With that he went into the forest and began to chop. ,4744,4797
56,"He chopped down big pine and fir trees, as thick as masts, and all that he found on the king's ground, as well as what he found on that of his neighbors. ",4797,4951
57,"But he cut off neither the branches nor the tree-tops, so that all lay there as though felled by the storm. ",4951,5059
58,"Then he loaded a sizable stack on the sled, and put to the horses. ",5059,5126
59,But they could not move the load from the spot. ,5126,5174
60,"So he unharnessed them, and put himself to the sled, and went off alone with the load. ",5174,5261
61,"When he came to the king's castle, there stood the king with the master carpenter in the entrance, and they were ready to give him a warm reception, because of the destruction he had wrought in the forest. ",5261,5467
62,For the master carpenter had been there and seen the havoc he had made. ,5467,5539
63,"But when Murmur Goose-Egg came along with half the forest, the king grew frightened as well as angry, and he thought that if Murmur was so strong, it would be best to handle him with care. ",5539,5728
64,"""Why, you are a splendid workman,"" said the king, ""but tell me, how much do you really eat at once,"" he continued, ""for I am sure you are hungry?"" ",5728,5875
65,"If he were to have enough porridge, they would have to take twelve tons of meal to make it. ",5875,5967
66,"After he had eaten that, then he could wait a while, said Murmur Goose-Egg. ",5967,6043
67,"It took some time before so much porridge could be prepared, and in the meantime Murmur was to carry wood into the kitchen. ",6043,6167
68,So he piled the whole load of wood on a sled. ,6167,6213
69,"When he drove it through the door, he did not go to work about it very gently. ",6213,6292
70,"The house nearly broke from its joints, and he well-nigh tore down the entire castle. ",6292,6378
71,"When at last dinner was ready, they sent him out into the field, to call the help. ",6378,6461
72,He called so loudly that hill and vale reechoed the sound. ,6461,6520
73,But still the people did not come quick enough to suit him. ,6520,6580
74,"So he picked a quarrel with them, and killed twelve. ",6580,6633
75,"""You kill twelve of my people, and you eat for twelve times twelve of them, but how many men's work can you do?"" ",6633,6746
76,asked the king. ,6746,6762
77,"""I do the work of twelve times twelve, too,"" said Murmur. ",6762,6820
78,"When he had eaten, he was to go to the barn and thresh. ",6820,6876
79,"So he pulled the beam out of the roof-tree, and made a flail out of it, and when the roof threatened to fall in, he took a pine-tree with all its boughs and branches, and set it up in place of the roof-beam. ",6876,7084
80,"Then he threshed corn and hay and straw, all together, and it seemed as though a cloud hung over the royal castle. ",7084,7199
81,"When Murmur Goose-Egg had nearly finished threshing, the enemy broke into the land, and war began. ",7199,7298
82,"Then the king told him to gather people about him, and go to meet the foe, and do battle with him, for he thought the enemy would probably kill him. ",7298,7447
83,"No, said Murmur Goose-Egg, he did not want to have the king's people killed. ",7447,7524
84,He would see that he dealt with the enemy himself. ,7524,7575
85,"All the better, thought the king, then I am sure to get rid of him. ",7575,7643
86,"But he would need a proper club, said Murmur. ",7643,7689
87,"So they sent to the smith, and he forged a club of two hundred-weights. ",7689,7761
88,"That would only do for a nut-cracker, said Murmur Goose-Egg. ",7761,7822
89,So he forged another that weighed six hundred-weights. ,7822,7877
90,"That would do to hammer shoes with, said Murmur Goose-Egg. ",7877,7936
91,But the smith told him that he and all his workmen together could not forge a larger one. ,7936,8026
92,"Then Murmur Goose-Egg went into the smithy himself, and forged himself a club of thirty hundred-weights. ",8026,8131
93,It would have taken a hundred men just to turn it around on the anvil. ,8131,8202
94,"This might do at a pinch, said Murmur. ",8202,8241
95,Then he wanted a knapsack with provisions. ,8241,8284
96,"It was sewn together out of fifteen ox-skins, and stuffed full of provisions. ",8284,8362
97,"Then Murmur wandered down the hill with the knapsack on his back, and the club over his shoulder. ",8362,8460
98,"When he came near enough for the soldiers to see him, they sent to ask whether he had a mind to attack them. ",8460,8569
99,"""Just wait until I have eaten,"" said Murmur, and sat him down behind his knapsack to eat. ",8569,8659
100,"But the enemy would not wait, and began to fire at him. ",8659,8715
101,And it fairly rained and hailed musket-balls all around Murmur. ,8715,8779
102,"""I don't care a fig for these blueberries,"" said Murmur Goose-Egg, and feasted on quite at ease. ",8779,8876
103,"Neither lead nor iron could wound him, and his knapsack stood before him, and caught the bullets like a wall. ",8876,8986
104,"Then the enemy began to throw bombs at him, and shoot at him with cannon. ",8986,9060
105,He hardly moved when he was struck. ,9060,9096
106,"""O, that's of no account!"" ",9096,9123
107,said he. ,3475,3484
108,But then a bomb flew into his wind-pipe. ,9132,9173
109,"""Faugh!"" ",9173,9182
110,"said he, and spat it out again, and then came a chain-bullet and fell into his butter-plate, and another tore away the bit of bread from between his fingers. ",9182,9340
111,"Then he grew angry, stood up, took his club, pounded the ground with it, and asked whether they wanted to take the food from his mouth with the blueberries they were blowing out at him from their clumsy blow-pipes. ",9340,9555
112,"Then he struck a few more blows, so that the hills and valleys round about trembled, and all the enemy flew up into the air like chaff, and that was the end of the war. ",9555,9724
113,"When Murmur came back and asked for more work, the king was at a loss, for he had felt sure that now he was rid of him. ",9724,9844
114,So he knew of nothing better to do than to send him to the devil's place. ,9844,9918
115,"""Now you can go to the devil, and fetch the tribute from him,"" said the king. ",9918,9996
116,"Murmur Goose-Egg went off with his knapsack on his back, and his club over his shoulder. ",9996,10085
117,He had soon reached the right spot. ,10085,10121
118,When he got there the devil was away at a trial. ,10121,10170
119,"There was no one home but his grandmother, and she said she had never yet heard anything about a tribute, and that he was to come back some other time. ",10170,10322
120,"""Yes, indeed, come again to-morrow,"" said he. ",10322,10368
121,"""I know that old excuse!"" ",10368,10394
122,"But since he was there, he would stay there, for he had to take home the tribute, and he had plenty of time to wait. ",10394,10511
123,"But when he had eaten all his provisions, he grew weary. ",10511,10568
124,He again demanded the tribute from the grandmother. ,10568,10620
125,"""You will get nothing from me, and that's as flat as the old fir-tree outside is fast,"" said the devil's grandmother. ",10620,10738
126,"The fir-tree stood in front of the gate to the devil's place, and was so large that fifteen men could hardly girdle it with their arms. ",10738,10874
127,But Murmur climbed up into its top and bent and shook it to and fro as though it were a willow wand. ,10874,10975
128,Then asked the devil's grandmother once more whether she would now pay him the tribute. ,10975,11063
129,"So she did not dare to refuse any longer, and brought out as much money as he could possibly carry in his knapsack. ",11063,11179
130,Then he set out for home with the tribute. ,11179,11222
131,"Now no sooner had he gone than the devil came home, and when he learned that Murmur had taken along a big bag of money. ",11222,11342
132,"He first beat his grandmother, and then hurried after Murmur. ",11342,11404
133,"And he soon caught up to him, for he ran over sticks and stones, and sometimes flew in between; ",11404,11500
134, while Murmur had to stick to the highway with his heavy knapsack. ,11499,11566
135,"But with the devil at his heels, he began to run as fast as he could. ",11566,11636
136,"He stretched out the club behind him, to keep the devil from coming to close quarters. ",11636,11723
137,"And thus they ran along, one behind the other. ",11723,11770
138,"Murmur held the shaft and the devil the end of the club, until they reached a deep valley. ",11770,11861
139,"There Murmur jumped from one mountain-top to another, and the devil followed him so hotly that he ran into the club, fell down into the valley and broke his foot-and there he lay. ",11861,12041
140,"""There's your tribute!"" ",12041,12065
141,"said Murmur Goose-Egg, when he had reached the royal castle, and he flung down the knapsack full of money before the king, so that the whole castle tottered. ",12065,12223
142,"The king thanked him kindly, and promised him a good reward, and a good character, if he wanted it; ",12223,12323
143, but Murmur only wanted more work to do. ,12322,12363
144,"""What shall I do now?"" ",12363,12386
145,he asked. ,12386,12396
146,"The king reflected for a while, and then he said Murmur should travel to the hill-troll, who had robbed him of the sword of his ancestors. ",12396,12535
147,"He lived in a castle by the sea, where no one ventured to go. ",12535,12597
148,"Murmur was given a few cart-loads of provisions in his big knapsack, and once more set out. ",12597,12689
149,"Long he wandered, though, over field and wood, over hills and deep valleys, till he came to a great mountain where the troll lived who had robbed the king of the sword. ",12689,12858
150,"But the troll was not out in the open, and the mountain was closed, so Murmur could not get it. ",12858,12954
151,"So he joined a party of stone-breakers, who were working at a mountainside, and worked along with them. ",12954,13058
152,"They had never had such a helper, for Murmur hewed away at the rocks till they burst, and stone bowlders as large as houses came rolling down. ",13058,13201
153,"But when he was about to rest and eat up the first cart-load of his provisions, it had already been eaten up. ",13201,13311
154,"""I have a good appetite myself,"" said Murmur, ""but whoever got hold of it has an even better one, for he has eaten up the bones as well!"" ",13311,13449
155,"Thus it went the first day, and the second was no better. ",13449,13507
156,"On the third day he went to work again, and took along the third cart-load, lay down behind it, and pretended to be sleeping. ",13507,13633
157,"Then a troll with seven heads came out of the hill, began to smack his lips, and eat of his provisions. ",13633,13737
158,"""Now the table is set, so now I am going to eat,"" said he. ",13737,13796
159,"""First we'll see about that,"" said Murmur, and hewed away at the troll so that the heads flew from his body. ",13796,13905
160,"Then he went into the hill out of which the troll had come, and inside stood a horse eating out of a barrel of glowing ashes, while behind him stood a barrel filled with oats. ",13905,14081
161,"""Why don't you eat out of the barrel of oats?"" ",14081,14128
162,asked Murmur Goose-Egg. ,14128,14152
163,"""Because I cannot turn around,"" said the horse. ",14152,14200
164,"""I will turn you around,"" said Murmur Goose-Egg. ",14200,14249
165,"""Tear my head off instead,"" pleaded the horse. ",14249,14296
166,"Murmur did so, and then the horse turned into a fine-looking man. ",14296,14362
167,"He said that he had been enchanted, and turned into a horse by the troll. ",14362,14436
168,"Then he helped Murmur look for the sword, which the troll had hidden under the bed. ",14436,14520
169,"But in the bed lay the troll's grandmother, and she was snoring. ",14520,14585
170,"They went home by water, and just as they sailed off the old troll grandmother came after them; ",14585,14681
171," but she could not get at them, hence she commenced to drink, so that the water went down and grew lower. ",14680,14786
172,"But at last she could not drink up the whole sea, and so she burst. ",14786,14854
173,"When they came ashore, Murmur sent to the king, and had him told to have the sword fetched; ",14854,14946
174," but though the king sent four horses, they could not move it from the spot. ",14945,15022
175,"He sent eight, he sent twelve, but the sword remained where it was, and could not be moved from the spot by any means. ",15022,15141
176,"Then Murmur Goose-Egg took it up, and carried it alone. ",15141,15197
177,The king could not believe his eyes when he saw Murmur once more; ,15197,15263
178, but he was very friendly and promised him gold and green forests. ,15262,15329
179,"But when Murmur asked for more work, he told him to travel to his troll's castle, where no one dared go, and to remain there until he had built a bridge across the sound, so that people could cross. ",15329,15528
180,"If he could do that, he would reward him well, yes, he would even give him his daughter, said the king. ",15528,15632
181,"He would attend to it, said Murmur. ",15632,15668
182,Yet no human being had ever returned thence alive; ,15668,15719
183," all who had gotten so far, lay on the ground dead, and crushed to a jelly, and the king thought, when sending him there, that he would never see him again. ",15718,15875
184,But Murmur set out. ,15875,15895
185,"He took with him his knapsack full of provisions, and a properly turned and twisted block of pine-wood, as well as an ax, a wedge and some wooden chips. ",15895,16048
186,"When he reached the sound, the river was full of drifting ice, and it roared like a waterfall. ",16048,16143
187,"But he planted his legs firmly on the ground, and waded along until he got across. ",16143,16226
188,"When he had warmed himself and satisfied his hunger, he wanted to sleep; ",16226,16299
189," but a tumult and rumbling started, as though the whole castle were to be turned upside down. ",16298,16392
190,"The gate flew wide open, and Murmur saw nothing but a pair of yawning jaws that reached from the threshold to the top of the door. ",16392,16523
191,"""Let's see who you may be? ",16523,16550
192,"Perhaps you are an old friend of mine,"" said Murmur. ",16550,16603
193,"And sure enough, it was Master Devil. ",16603,16641
194,Then they played cards together. ,16641,16674
195,The devil would gladly have won back some of the tribute Murmur had forced from his grandmother for the king. ,16674,16784
196,"Yet, no matter how he played, Murmur always won; ",16784,16833
197, for he made a cross on the cards. ,16832,16867
198,"And after he had won all the devil had with him, the latter had to give him some of the gold and silver that was in the castle. ",16867,16995
199,"In the midst of their game the fire went out, so that they could no longer tell the cards apart. ",16995,17092
200,"""Now we must split wood,"" said Murmur. ",17092,17131
201,"He hewed into the block of pine-wood with his ax, and drove in the wedge, but the tree-stump was tough, and would not split at once, though Murmur gave himself all manner of pains. ",17131,17312
202,"""You are supposed to be strong,"" he said to the devil. ",17312,17367
203,"""Spit on your hands, slap in your claws here, and pull the block apart, so that I can see what you can do!"" ",17367,17475
204,"The devil obediently thrust both hands into the split, and tore and clawed with all his might; ",17475,17570
205," but suddenly Murmur Goose-Egg knocked out the wedge, and there the devil was caught in a vice, while Murmur belabored his back with the ax. ",17569,17710
206,"The devil wailed, and begged Murmur to let him go; ",17710,17761
207, but Murmur would hear nothing of it until he had promised never to come back and make a nuisance of himself again. ,17760,17876
208,"Besides that, he had to promise to build a bridge over the sound, on which one could go back and forth at all seasons of the year. ",17876,18007
209,And the bridge was to be completed immediately after the breaking up of the ice-drift. ,18007,18094
210,"""Alas!"" ",18094,18102
211,"said the devil, but there was nothing for it but to promise if he wished to go free. ",18102,18187
212,"Yet he made one condition, that he was to have the first soul that crossed the bridge as sound-toll. ",18187,18288
213,"He could have it, said Murmur. ",18288,18319
214,"Then he let the devil out, and he ran straight home. ",18319,18372
215,But Murmur lay down and slept until far into the following day. ,18372,18436
216,"Then the king came to see whether Murmur Goose-Egg were lying crushed on the ground, or had merely been badly beaten. ",18436,18554
217,He had to wade through piles of money before he could reach the bed. ,18554,18623
218,"The money was stacked up high along the walls in heaps and in bags, and Murmur lay in the bed and snored. ",18623,18729
219,"""May heaven help me and my daughter!"" ",18729,18767
220,"cried the king, when he saw that Murmur Goose-Egg was in the best of health. ",18767,18844
221,"Yes, and no one could deny that everything had been well and thoroughly done, said the king. ",18844,18937
222,There could be no talk of marriage as long as the bridge had not been built. ,18937,19014
223,Then one day the bridge was finished; ,19014,19052
224," and on it stood the devil, ready to collect the toll promised him. ",19051,19119
225,Murmur Goose-Egg wanted the king to be the first to try the bridge with him. ,19119,19196
226,"The king had no mind to do so, therefore Murmur himself mounted a horse, and swung up the fat dairy-maid from the castle before him on the saddle-bow-she looked almost like a gigantic block of wood-and dashed across the bridge with her so that the planks fairly thundered. ",19196,19469
227,"""Where is my sound-toll? ",19469,19494
228,"Where is the soul?"" ",19494,19514
229,cried the devil. ,19514,19531
230,"""Sitting in this block of wood! ",19531,19563
231,"If you want her, you must spit on your hands and catch hold of her,"" said Murmur Goose-Egg. ",19563,19655
232,"""No, thank you! ",19655,19671
233,"If she does not catch hold of me, then I'll certainly not catch hold of her,"" said the devil. ",19671,19765
234,"""You caught me in a vice once, but you can't fool me a second time,"" said he, and flew straight home to his grandmother, and since then nothing more has been heard or seen of him. ",19765,19945
235,But Murmur Goose-Egg hurried back to the castle and asked for the reward the king had promised him. ,19945,20045
236,"And when the king hesitated and began to make all sorts of excuses, in order not to have to keep his promise. ",20045,20155
237,"Murmur said it would be best to have a substantial knapsackful of provisions made ready, since now he, Murmur, was going to take his reward himself. ",20155,20304
238,"This the king did, and when the knapsack was ready, Murmur took the king along with him in front of the castle, and gave him a proper shove, so that he flew high up into the air. ",20304,20483
239,"And he threw the knapsack up after him, so that he would not be left altogether without provisions. ",20483,20583
240,"If he has not come down yet, then he, together with the knapsack, is floating between heaven and earth to this very day.",20583,20704
