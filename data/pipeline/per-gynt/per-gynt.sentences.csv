0,In the old days there lived in Kvam a marksman by the name of Per Gynt. ,0,72
1,"He was continually in the mountains, where he shot bear and elk. ",72,137
2,"At that time there were more forests on the Fjoll, and all sorts of beasts dwelt in them. ",137,227
3,"Once, late in the fall, when the cattle had long since been driven down from the mountain pastures, Per Gynt decided to go up on the Fjoll again. ",227,373
4,"With the exception of three dairy-maids, all the herd-folk had already left the mountains. ",373,464
5,"But when Per Gynt reached Hovringalm, where he intended to stay over-night in a herdsman's hut, it already was so dark that he could not see his hand before his eyes. ",464,631
6,Then the dogs began to bark so violently that he felt quite uneasy. ,631,699
7,And suddenly his foot struck something. ,699,739
8,"When he took hold of it, it was cold, and large and slippery. ",739,801
9,"Since he felt certain he had not left the path, he could not imagine what it might be; ",801,888
10, but he sensed that all was not in order. ,887,929
11,"""And who are you?"" ",929,948
12,"asked Per Gynt, for he noticed that it moved. ",948,994
13,"""O, I am the crooked one,"" was the answer. ",994,1037
14,And now Per Gynt knew as much as he had before. ,1037,1085
15,"So he went along its length, ""for sooner or later I will come to the end of it,"" thought he. ",1085,1178
16,"As he went along he again struck against something, and when he felt it, it was again something cold, and large and slippery. ",1178,1304
17,"""And who are you?"" ",929,948
18,asked Per Gynt. ,1323,1339
19,"""I am the crooked one,"" was again the answer. ",1339,1385
20,"""Well, whether you be crooked or straight, you will have to let me pass,"" said Per Gynt. ",1385,1474
21,"He noticed that he was going around in a circle, and that the crooked one had coiled himself about the herdsman's cottage. ",1474,1597
22,"At these words the crooked one moved a little to one side, so that Per Gynt could get into the cottage. ",1597,1701
23,When he entered he found it as dark inside as it was out. ,1701,1759
24,He stumbled and felt his way along the walls. ,1759,1805
25,He wanted to lay aside his firelock and his hunting-bag. ,1805,1862
26,"But while he was feeling his way about, he once more noticed the something large, and cold and slippery. ",1862,1967
27,"""And who are you now?"" ",1967,1990
28,cried Per Gynt. ,1990,2006
29,"""O, I am the big crooked one,"" was the answer. ",2006,2053
30,"And no matter where he took hold or where he set his foot, he could feel the coils of the crooked one laid around him. ",2053,2172
31,"""This is a poor place to be in,"" thought Per Gynt, ""for this crooked one is outside and inside. ",2172,2268
32,"I will soon put what is wrong to rights."" ",2268,2310
33,"He took his firelock, went out again, and felt his way along the crooked one until he came to his head. ",2310,2414
34,"""And who are you really and truly?"" ",2414,2450
35,he asked. ,2450,2460
36,"""O, I am the big crooked one of Etnedal,"" said the monster troll. ",2460,2526
37,"Then Per Gynt did not waste any time, but shot three bullets right through the middle of his head. ",2526,2625
38,"""Shoot again!"" ",2625,2640
39,cried the crooked one. ,2640,2663
40,"But Per Gynt knew better, for had he shot another time, the bullet would have rebounded and hit him. ",2663,2764
41,"When this had been done, Per Gynt and his dogs took hold of the great troll, and dragged him out of the hut, so that they might make themselves comfortable there. ",2764,2927
42,And meanwhile the hills about rang with laughter and jeers. ,2927,2987
43,"""Per Gynt pulled hard, but the dogs pulled harder!"" ",2987,3039
44,rang in his ears. ,3039,3057
45,In the morning Per Gynt went out hunting. ,3057,3099
46,"When he had made his way far into the Fjoll, he saw a girl driving sheep and goats across a mountain-top. ",3099,3205
47,"But when he reached the top of the mountain, the girl had vanished, as well as her flock, and all he saw was a great pack of bears. ",3205,3337
48,"""Never yet have I seen bears run together in packs,"" thought Per Gynt. ",3337,3408
49,"But when he came nearer, they all disappeared save one alone. ",3408,3470
50,"Then a voice called from a nearby hill: ""Guard your boar, for understand, Per Gynt is without, With his firelock in his hand!"" ",3470,3597
51,"""O, then it is the worse for Per Gynt; ",3597,3636
52," but not for my boar, because Per Gynt did not wash to-day,"" sounded back from the hill. ",3635,3724
53,"But Per Gynt spat on his hands, and washed them thus, and then shot the bear. ",3724,3802
54,"The hills rang with echoing laughter: ""You should have guarded your boar better,"" called one voice. ",3802,3902
55,"""I did not think he carried the wash-bowl in his mouth,"" answered the other. ",3902,3979
56,"Per Gynt skinned the bear, and buried his body among the bowlders; ",3979,4046
57, but the head and skin he took with him. ,4045,4086
58,On the way back he met a mountain fox. ,4086,4125
59,"""See, my little lamb, how fat you are!"" ",4125,4165
60,rang out from one hill. ,4165,4189
61,"""Just see how high Per Gynt carries his firelock!"" ",4189,4240
62,"sounded from another, as Per Gynt shouldered his firelock and shot the fox. ",4240,4316
63,"He also skinned, and took the skin with him. ",4316,4361
64,"When he reached the herdsman's hut, he nailed the heads, with jaws wide open, against the outer wall. ",4361,4463
65,Then he made a fire and hung a soup kettle over it. ,4463,4515
66,"It smoked so terribly he could hardly keep his eyes open, and therefore had to make a loop-hole. ",4515,4612
67,"Suddenly up came a troll, and thrust his nose through the loop-hole; ",4612,4681
68, but his nose was so long that it reached the fireplace. ,4680,4737
69,"""Here is my smeller, so take a good look!"" ",4737,4780
70,said he. ,4780,4789
71,"""Here is a taste of the soup that I cook!"" ",4789,4832
72,"said Per Gynt, and he poured the whole kettleful of soup over his nose. ",4832,4904
73,The troll rushed off lamenting loudly. ,4904,4943
74,"From all the heights around came laughter and derision and calls of: ""Gyri Soupsmeller, Gyri Soupsmeller!"" ",4943,5050
75,Thereupon all was quiet for a time. ,5050,5086
76,Before very long the noise and tumult outside began again. ,5086,5145
77,"Per Gynt looked out, and saw a wagon drawn by bears. ",5145,5198
78,"The great troll was loaded upon it, and off they went with him up the Fjoll. ",5198,5275
79,"Suddenly a pail of water was poured down through the chimney, smothering the fire, and Per Gynt sat in the dark. ",5275,5388
80,"Then laughter and jibes came from every corner, and one voice said: ""Now Per Gynt will be no better off than the dairy-maids in the hut at Val!"" ",5388,5533
81,"Per Gynt once more lit the fire, called his dogs and locked the herdsman's hut. ",5533,5613
82,"He went on North, toward the hut at Val, in which there were three dairy-maids. ",5613,5693
83,"After he had covered some distance he saw a fire, as though the whole hut were ablaze. ",5693,5780
84,"At the same moment he came across a whole pack of wolves, of whom he shot some and clubbed the others to death. ",5780,5892
85,"When he reached the hut at Val, he found it pitch dark there, and there was no fire to be seen, far or near. ",5892,6001
86,"But there were four strangers in the hut, who were frightening the dairy-maids. ",6001,6081
87,"They were four mountain trolls, and their names were: Gust i Vore, Tron Valfjeldet, Kjostol Aabakken, and Rolf Eldforkungen. ",6081,6206
88,"Gust i Vore stood at the door, on guard, and Per Gynt shot at him, but missed, so he ran away. ",6206,6301
89,When Per Gynt entered the room the dairy-maids were well-nigh frightened to death; ,6301,6384
90," but when the trolls saw who had come they began to wail, and told Eldforkungen to make a fire. ",6383,6479
91,"At the same moment the dogs sprang upon Kjostol Aabakken, and threw him head over heels into the hearth, so that the ashes and sparks flew about. ",6479,6625
92,"""Have you seen my snakes, Per Gynt?"" ",6625,6662
93,asked Tron Valfjeldet--for that was what he called the wolves. ,6662,6725
94,"""Yes, and now you shall travel the same road your snakes have gone!"" ",6725,6794
95,"cried Per Gynt, and shot him. ",6794,6824
96,Then he made an end of Aabakken with the butt-end of his firelock; ,6824,6891
97, but Eldforkungen had fled through the chimney. ,6890,6938
98,"After Per Gynt had done this, he accompanied the dairy-maids back to their village, for they did not venture to stay in the hut any longer. ",6938,7078
99,"When Christmas came, Per Gynt once more got under way. ",7078,7133
100,"He had heard of a farmstead at Dovre, where so many trolls were accustomed to congregate on Christmas Eve. ",7133,7240
101,"The people who lived there had to flee, and find places to stay at other farms. ",7240,7320
102,This farmstead Per Gynt decided to hunt up. ,7320,7364
103,He thought he would like to see these trolls. ,7364,7410
104,"He put on torn clothing, and took with him a tame bear which belonged to him, together with an awl, some pitch and some wire. ",7410,7536
105,"When he had reached the farmstead, he went into the house and asked for shelter. ",7536,7617
106,"""May God aid us!"" ",7617,7635
107,cried the man. ,7635,7650
108,"""We cannot shelter you, and have to leave the house ourselves, because the place is alive with trolls every Christmas Eve!"" ",7650,7774
109,But Per Gynt thought he could manage to clear the house of the trolls. ,7774,7845
110,"So they told him to stay, and gave him a pig's skin into the bargain. ",7845,7915
111,"Then the bear lay down behind the hearth, Per took out his awl, his pitch and his wire, and set out to make a single large shoe out of the pig's skin. ",7915,8066
112,"And he drew a thick rope through it for a lace, so that he could lace the whole shoe together, and besides he had two wagon-spokes for wedges at hand. ",8066,8217
113,"Suddenly the trolls came along with fiddles and fiddlers, and some of them danced, and others ate of the Christmas dinner that stood on the table, and some fried bacon, and others fried frogs and toads and disgusting things of that kind--the Christmas dinner they had brought along themselves. ",8217,8511
114,In the meantime some of them noticed the shoe Per Gynt had made. ,8511,8576
115,"Since it was evidently intended for a large foot, all the trolls wanted to try it on. ",8576,8662
116,"When every one of them had thrust in his foot, Per Gynt laced it, forced in a wedge, and then drew the lace so taut that every last one of them was caught and held in the shoe. ",8662,8839
117,"But now the bear thrust forth his nose, and sniffed the roast. ",8839,8902
118,"""Would you like to have some cake, little white cat?"" ",8902,8956
119,"said one of the trolls, and threw a burning hot, roasted frog into the bear's jaws. ",8956,9040
120,"""Thump them, Master Bruin!"" ",9040,9068
121,cried Per Gynt. ,1990,2006
122,"And the bear grew so angry that he rushed on the trolls, raining blows on every side and scratching them. ",9084,9190
123,And Per Gynt hewed into the crowd with his other wagon-spoke as though he meant to break their skulls. ,9190,9293
124,"Then the trolls had to make themselves scarce, but Per Gynt remained, and feasted on the Christmas fare all of Christmas week, while for many a long year no more was heard of the trolls.",9293,9480
