0,Far up in a green valley in the Island of Hoy stands an immense boulder. ,0,73
1,"It is hollow inside, and the natives of these northern islands call it the Dwarfie Stone, because long centuries ago, so the legend has it, Snorro the Dwarf lived there. ",73,243
2,"Nobody knew where Snorro came from, or how long he had dwelt in the dark chamber inside the Dwarfie Stone. ",243,350
3,"All that they knew about him was that he was a little man, with a queer, twisted, deformed body and a face of marvellous beauty, which never seemed to look any older, but was always smiling and young. ",350,551
4,"Men said that this was because Snorro's father had been a Fairy, and not a denizen of earth, who had bequeathed to his son the gift of perpetual youth, but nobody knew whether this were true or not, for the Dwarf had inhabited the Dwarfie Stone long before the oldest man or woman in Hoy had been born. ",551,854
5,"One thing was certain, however: he had inherited from his mother, whom all men agreed had been mortal, the dangerous qualities of vanity and ambition. ",854,1005
6,"And the longer he lived the more vain and ambitious did he become, until at last he always carried a mirror of polished steel round his neck, into which he constantly looked in order to see the reflection of his handsome face. ",1005,1232
7,"And he would not attend to the country people who came to seek his help, unless they bowed themselves humbly before him and spoke to him as if he were a King. ",1232,1391
8,"I say that the country people sought his help, for he spent his time, or appeared to spend it, in collecting herbs and simples on the hillsides, which he carried home with him to his dark abode, and distilled medicines and potions from them, which he sold to his neighbours at wondrous high prices. ",1391,1690
9,"He was also the possessor of a wonderful leathern-covered book, clasped with clasps of brass, over which he would pore for hours together, and out of which he would tell the simple Islanders their fortunes, if they would. ",1690,1912
10,"For they feared the book almost as much as they feared Snorro himself, for it was whispered that it had once belonged to Odin, and they crossed themselves for protection as they named the mighty Enchanter. ",1912,2118
11,But all the time they never guessed the real reason why Snorro chose to live in the Dwarfie Stone. ,2118,2217
12,I will tell you why he did so. ,2217,2248
13,"Not very far from the Stone there was a curious hill, shaped exactly like a wart. ",2248,2330
14,"It was known as the Wart Hill of Hoy, and men said that somewhere in the side of it was hidden a wonderful carbuncle, which, when it was found, would bestow on its finder marvellous magic gifts--Health, Wealth, and Happiness. ",2330,2556
15,"Everything, in fact, that a human being could desire. ",2556,2610
16,"And the curious thing about this carbuncle was, that it was said that it could be seen at certain times, if only the people who were looking for it were at the right spot at the right moment. ",2610,2802
17,"Now Snorro had made up his mind that he would find this wonderful stone, so, while he pretended to spend all his time in reading his great book or distilling medicines from his herbs, he was really keeping a keen look-out during his wanderings, noting every tuft of grass or piece of rock under which it might be hidden. ",2802,3123
18,"And at night, when everyone else was asleep, he would creep out, with pickaxe and spade, to turn over the rocks or dig over the turf, in the hope of finding the long-sought-for treasure underneath them. ",3123,3326
19,"He was always accompanied on these occasions by an enormous grey-headed Raven, who lived in the cave along with him, and who was his bosom friend and companion. ",3326,3487
20,"The Islanders feared this bird of ill omen as much, perhaps, as they feared its Master; ",3487,3575
21," for, although they went to consult Snorro in all their difficulties and perplexities, and bought medicines and love-potions from him, they always looked upon him with a certain dread, feeling that there was something weird and uncanny about him. ",3574,3821
22,"Now, at the time we are speaking of, Orkney was governed by two Earls, who were half-brothers. ",3821,3916
23,"Paul, the elder, was a tall, handsome man, with dark hair, and eyes like sloes. ",3916,3996
24,"All the country people loved him, for he was so skilled in knightly exercises, and had such a sweet and loving nature, that no one could help being fond of him. ",3996,4157
25,"Old people's eyes would brighten at the sight of him, and the little children would run out to greet him as he rode by their mothers' doors. ",4157,4298
26,"And this was the more remarkable because, with all his winning manner, he had such a lack of conversation that men called him Paul the Silent, or Paul the Taciturn. ",4298,4463
27,"Harold, on the other hand, was as different from his brother as night is from day. ",4463,4546
28,"He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, and he had gained for himself the name of Harold the Orator, because he was always free of speech and ready with his tongue. ",4546,4705
29,But for all this he was not a favourite. ,4705,4746
30,"For he was haughty, and jealous, and quick-tempered, and the old folks' eyes did not brighten at the sight of him, and the babes, instead of toddling out to greet him, hid their faces in their mothers' skirts when they saw him coming. ",4746,4981
31,"Harold could not help knowing that the people liked his silent brother best, and the knowledge made him jealous of him, so a coldness sprang up between them. ",4981,5139
32,"Now it chanced, one summer, that Earl Harold went on a visit to the King of Scotland, accompanied by his mother, the Countess Helga, and her sister, the Countess Fraukirk. ",5139,5311
33,"And while he was at Court he met a charming young Irish lady, the Lady Morna, who had come from Ireland to Scotland to attend upon the Scottish Queen. ",5311,5462
34,"She was so sweet, and good, and gentle that Earl Harold's heart was won, and he made up his mind that she, and only she, should be his bride. ",5462,5604
35,"But although he had paid her much attention, Lady Morna had sometimes caught glimpses of his jealous temper; ",5604,5713
36," she had seen an evil expression in his eyes, and had heard him speak sharply to his servants, and she had no wish to marry him. ",5712,5841
37,"So, to his great amazement, she refused the honour which he offered her, and told him that she would prefer to remain as she was. ",5841,5971
38,"Earl Harold ground his teeth in silent rage, but he saw that it was no use pressing his suit at that moment. ",5971,6080
39,So what he could not obtain by his own merits he determined to obtain by guile. ,6080,6160
40,"Accordingly he begged his mother to persuade the Lady Morna to go back with them on a visit, hoping that when she was alone with him in Orkney, he would be able to overcome her prejudice against him, and induce her to become his wife. ",6160,6395
41,And all the while he never remembered his brother Paul; ,6395,6451
42," or, if he did, he never thought it possible that he could be his rival. ",6450,6523
43,But that was just the very thing that happened. ,6523,6571
44,"The Lady Morna, thinking no evil, accepted the Countess Helga's invitation, and no sooner had the party arrived back in Orkney than Paul, charmed with the grace and beauty of the fair Irish Maiden, fell head over ears in love with her. ",6571,6807
45,"And the Lady Morna, from the very first hour that she saw him, returned his love. ",6807,6889
46,"Of course this state of things could not long go on hidden, and when Harold realised what had happened his anger and jealousy knew no bounds. ",6889,7031
47,"Seizing a dagger, he rushed up to the turret where his brother was sitting in his private apartments, and threatened to stab him to the heart if he did not promise to give up all thoughts of winning the lovely stranger. ",7031,7251
48,But Paul met him with pleasant words. ,7251,7289
49,"""Calm thyself, Brother,"" he said. ",7289,7323
50,"""It is true that I love the lady, but that is no proof that I shall win her. ",7323,7400
51,"Is it likely that she will choose me, whom all men name Paul the Silent, when she hath the chance of marrying you, whose tongue moves so swiftly that to you is given the proud title of Harold the Orator?"" ",7400,7605
52,"At these words Harold's vanity was flattered, and he thought that, after all, his step-brother was right, and that he had a very small chance, with his meagre gift of speech, of being successful in his suit. ",7605,7813
53,"So he threw down his dagger, and, shaking hands with him, begged him to pardon his unkind thoughts, and went down the winding stair again in high good-humour with himself and all the world. ",7813,8003
54,"By this time it was coming near to the Feast of Yule, and at that Festival it was the custom for the Earl and his Court to leave Kirkwall for some weeks, and go to the great Palace of Orphir, nine miles distant. ",8003,8215
55,"And in order to see that everything was ready, Earl Paul took his departure some days before the others. ",8215,8320
56,The evening before he left he chanced to find the Lady Morna sitting alone in one of the deep windows of the great hall. ,8320,8441
57,"She had been weeping, for she was full of sadness at the thought of his departure; ",8441,8524
58," and at the sight of her distress the kind-hearted young Earl could no longer contain himself, but, folding her in his arms, he whispered to her how much he loved her, and begged her to promise to be his wife. ",8523,8733
59,She agreed willingly. ,8733,8755
60,"Hiding her rosy face on his shoulder, she confessed that she had loved him from the very first day that she had seen him; ",8755,8877
61," and ever since that moment she had determined that, if she could not wed him, she would wed no other man. ",8876,8983
62,"For a little time they sat together, rejoicing in their new-found happiness. ",8983,9060
63,Then Earl Paul sprang to his feet. ,9060,9095
64,"""Let us go and tell the good news to my mother and my brother,"" he said. ",9095,9168
65,"""Harold may be disappointed at first, for I know, Sweetheart, he would fain have had thee for his own. ",9168,9271
66,"But his good heart will soon overcome all that, and he will rejoice with us also."" ",9271,9354
67,But the Lady Morna shook her head. ,9354,9389
68,"She knew, better than her lover, what Earl Harold's feeling would be; ",9389,9459
69, and she would fain put off the evil hour. ,9458,9501
70,"""Let us hold our peace till after Yule,"" she pleaded. ",9501,9555
71,"""It will be a joy to keep our secret to ourselves for a little space; ",9555,9625
72," there will be time enough then to let all the world know."" ",9624,9684
73,"Rather reluctantly, Earl Paul agreed; ",9684,9722
74," and next day he set off for the Palace at Orphir, leaving his lady-love behind him. ",9721,9806
75,Little he guessed the danger he was in! ,9806,9846
76,"For, all unknown to him, his step-aunt, Countess Fraukirk, had chanced to be in the hall, the evening before, hidden behind a curtain, and she had overheard every word that Morna and he had spoken, and her heart was filled with black rage. ",9846,10086
77,"For she was a hard, ambitious woman, and she had always hated the young Earl, who was no blood-relation to her, and who stood in the way of his brother, her own nephew; ",10086,10255
78," for, if Paul were only dead, Harold would be the sole Earl of Orkney. ",10254,10325
79,"And now that he had stolen the heart of the Lady Morna, whom her own nephew loved, her hate and anger knew no bounds. ",10325,10443
80,She had hastened off to her sister's chamber as soon as the lovers had parted; ,10443,10522
81, and there the two women had remained talking together till the chilly dawn broke in the sky. ,10521,10615
82,Countess Fraukirk ... hidden behind a curtain ... overheard every word.] ,10615,10688
83,Next day a boat went speeding over the narrow channel of water that separates Pomona (on the mainland) from Hoy. ,10688,10801
84,"In it sat a woman, but who she was, or what she was like, no one could say, for she was covered from head to foot with a black cloak, and her face was hidden behind a thick, dark veil. ",10801,10986
85,"Snorro the Dwarf knew her, even before she laid aside her trappings, for Countess Fraukirk was no stranger to him. ",10986,11101
86,"In the course of her long life she had often had occasion to seek his aid to help her in her evil deeds, and she had always paid him well for his services in yellow gold. ",11101,11272
87,He therefore welcomed her gladly; ,11272,11306
88," but when he had heard the nature of her errand his smiling face grew grave again, and he shook his head. ",11305,11411
89,"""I have served thee well, Lady, in the past,"" he said, ""but methinks that this thing goeth beyond my courage. ",11411,11521
90,"For to compass an Earl's death is a weighty matter, especially when he is so well beloved as is the Earl Paul."" ",11521,11633
91,"""Thou knowest why I have taken up my abode in this lonely spot--how I hope some day to light upon the magic carbuncle. ",11633,11752
92,"Thou knowest also how the people fear me, and hate me too, forsooth. ",11752,11821
93,"And if the young Earl died, and suspicion fell on me, I must needs fly the Island, for my life would not be worth a grain of sand. ",11821,11952
94,Then my chance of success would be gone. ,11952,11993
95,Nay! ,11993,11998
96,"I cannot do it, Lady; ",11998,12020
97," I cannot do it."" ",12019,12037
98,"But the wily Countess offered him much gold, and bribed him higher and higher, first with wealth, then with success, and lastly she promised to obtain for him a high post at the Court of the King of Scotland; ",12037,12246
99," and at that his ambition stirred within him, his determination gave way, and he consented to do what she asked. ",12245,12358
100,"""I will summon my magic loom,"" he said, ""and weave a piece of cloth of finest texture and of marvellous beauty; ",12358,12470
101," and before I weave it I will so poison the thread with a magic potion that, when it is fashioned into a garment, whoever puts it on will die ere he hath worn it many minutes."" ",12469,12646
102,"""Thou art a clever knave,"" answered the Countess, a cruel smile lighting up her evil face, ""and thou shalt be rewarded. ",12646,12766
103,"Let me have a couple of yards of this wonderful web, and I will make a bonnie waistcoat for my fine young Earl and give it to him as a Yuletide gift. ",12766,12916
104,"Then I reckon that he will not see the year out."" ",12916,12966
105,"""That will he not,"" said Dwarf Snorro, with a malicious grin; ",12966,13028
106," and the two parted, after arranging that the piece of cloth should be delivered at the Palace of Orphir on the day before Christmas Eve. ",13027,13165
107,"Now, when the Countess Fraukirk had been away upon her wicked errand, strange things were happening at the Castle at Kirkwall. ",13165,13292
108,"For Harold, encouraged by his brother's absence, offered his heart and hand once more to the Lady Morna. ",13292,13397
109,"Once more she refused him, and in order to make sure that the scene should not be repeated, she told him that she had plighted her troth to his brother. ",13397,13550
110,"When he heard that this was so, rage and fury were like to devour him. ",13550,13621
111,"Mad with anger, he rushed from her presence, flung himself upon his horse, and rode away in the direction of the sea shore. ",13621,13745
112,"While he was galloping wildly along, his eyes fell on the snow-clad hills of Hoy rising up across the strip of sea that divided the one island from the other. ",13745,13904
113,"And his thoughts flew at once to Snorro the Dwarf, who he had had occasion, as well as his step-aunt, to visit in bygone days. ",13904,14031
114,"""I have it,"" he cried. ",14031,14054
115,"""Stupid fool that I was not to think of it at once. ",14054,14106
116,"I will go to Snorro, and buy from him a love-potion, which will make my Lady Morna hate my precious brother and turn her thoughts kindly towards me."" ",14106,14256
117,"So he made haste to hire a boat, and soon he was speeding over the tossing waters on his way to the Island of Hoy. ",14256,14371
118,"When he arrived there he hurried up the lonely valley to where the Dwarfie Stone stood, and he had no difficulty in finding its uncanny occupant, for Snorro was standing at the hole that served as a door, his raven on his shoulder, gazing placidly at the setting sun. ",14371,14639
119,"A curious smile crossed his face when, hearing the sound of approaching footsteps, he turned round and his eyes fell on the young noble. ",14639,14776
120,"""What bringeth thee here, Sir Earl?"" ",14776,14813
121,"he asked gaily, for he scented more gold. ",14813,14855
122,"""I come for a love-potion,"" said Harold; ",14855,14896
123, and without more ado he told the whole story to the Wizard. ,14895,14956
124,"""I will pay thee for it,"" he added, ""if thou wilt give it to me quickly."" ",14956,15030
125,Snorro looked at him from head to foot. ,15030,15070
126,"""Blind must the maiden be, Sir Orator,"" he said, ""who needeth a love-potion to make her fancy so gallant a Knight."" ",15070,15186
127,Earl Harold laughed angrily. ,15186,15215
128,"""It is easier to catch a sunbeam than a woman's roving fancy,"" he replied. ",15215,15290
129,"""I have no time for jesting. ",15290,15319
130,"For, hearken, old man, there is a proverb that saith, 'Time and tide wait for no man,' so I need not expect the tide to wait for me. ",15319,15452
131,"The potion I must have, and that instantly."" ",15452,15497
132,"Snorro saw that he was in earnest, so without a word he entered his dwelling, and in a few minutes returned with a small phial in his hand, which was full of a rosy liquid. ",15497,15670
133,"""Pour the contents of this into the Lady Morna's wine-cup,"" he said, ""and I warrant thee that before four-and-twenty hours have passed she will love thee better than thou lovest her now."" ",15670,15858
134,"Then he waved his hand, as if to dismiss his visitor, and disappeared into his dwelling-place. ",15858,15953
135,Earl Harold made all speed back to the Castle; ,15953,16000
136, but it was not until one or two days had elapsed that he found a chance to pour the love-potion into the Lady Morna's wine-cup. ,15999,16128
137,"But at last, one night at supper, he found an opportunity of doing so, and, waving away the little page-boy, he handed it to her himself. ",16128,16266
138,"She raised it to her lips, but she only made a pretence at drinking, for she had seen the hated Earl fingering the cup, and she feared some deed of treachery. ",16266,16425
139,"When he had gone back to his seat she managed to pour the whole of the wine on the floor, and smiled to herself at the look of satisfaction that came over Harold's face as she put down the empty cup. ",16425,16625
140,"His satisfaction increased, for from that moment she felt so afraid of him that she treated him with great kindness, hoping that by doing so she would keep in his good graces until the Court moved to Orphir, and her own true love could protect her. ",16625,16874
141,"Harold, on his side, was delighted with her graciousness, for he felt certain that the charm was beginning to work, and that his hopes would soon be fulfilled. ",16874,17034
142,"A week later the Court removed to the Royal Palace at Orphir, where Earl Paul had everything in readiness for the reception of his guests. ",17034,17173
143,"Of course he was overjoyed to meet Lady Morna again, and she was overjoyed to meet him, for she felt that she was now safe from the unwelcome attentions of Earl Harold. ",17173,17342
144,"But to Earl Harold the sight of their joy was as gall and bitterness, and he could scarcely contain himself, although he still trusted in the efficacy of Snorro the Dwarf's love-potion. ",17342,17528
145,"As for Countess Fraukirk and Countess Helga, they looked forward eagerly to the time when the magic web would arrive, out of which they hoped to fashion a fatal gift for Earl Paul. ",17528,17709
146,"At last, the day before Christmas Eve, the two wicked women were sitting in the Countess Helga's chamber talking of the time when Earl Harold would rule alone in Orkney, when a tap came to the window, and on looking round they saw Dwarf Snorro's grey-headed Raven perched on the sill, a sealed packet in its beak. ",17709,18023
147,"They opened the casement, and with a hoarse croak the creature let the packet drop on to the floor; ",18023,18123
148, then it flapped its great wings and rose slowly into the air again its head turned in the direction of Hoy. ,18122,18231
149,With fingers that trembled with excitement they broke the seals and undid the packet. ,18231,18317
150,"It contained a piece of the most beautiful material that anyone could possibly imagine, woven in all the colours of the rainbow, and sparkling with gold and jewels. ",18317,18482
151,"""Twill make a bonnie waistcoat,"" exclaimed Countess Fraukirk, with an unholy laugh. ",18482,18566
152,"""The Silent Earl will be a braw man when he gets it on."" ",18566,18623
153,"Then, without more ado, they set to work to cut out and sew the garment. ",18623,18696
154,"All that night they worked, and all next day, till, late in the afternoon, when they were putting in the last stitches, hurried footsteps were heard ascending the winding staircase, and Earl Harold burst open the door. ",18696,18915
155,"His cheeks were red with passion, and his eyes were bright, for he could not but notice that, now that she was safe at Orphir under her true love's protection, the Lady Morna's manner had grown cold and distant again, and he was beginning to lose faith in Snorro's charm. ",18915,19187
156,"Angry and disappointed, he had sought his mother's room to pour out his story of vexation to her. ",19187,19285
157,"He stopped short, however, when he saw the wonderful waistcoat lying on the table, all gold and silver and shining colours. ",19285,19409
158,"It was like a fairy garment, and its beauty took his breath away. ",19409,19475
159,"""For whom hast thou purchased that?"" ",19475,19512
160,"he asked, hoping to hear that it was intended for him. ",19512,19567
161,"""Tis a Christmas gift for thy brother Paul,"" answered his mother, and she would have gone on to tell him how deadly a thing it was, had he given her time to speak. ",19567,19731
162,"But her words fanned his fury into madness, for it seemed to him that this hated brother of his was claiming everything. ",19731,19852
163,"""Everything is for Paul! ",19852,19877
164,"I am sick of his very name,"" he cried. ",19877,19916
165,"""By my troth, he shall not have this!"" ",19916,19955
166,and he snatched the vest from the table. ,19955,19996
167,"It was in vain that his mother and his aunt threw themselves at his feet, begging him to lay it down, and warning him that there was not a thread in it which was not poisoned. ",19996,20172
168,"He paid no heed to their words, but rushed from the room, and, drawing it on, ran downstairs with a reckless laugh, to show the Lady Morna how fine he was. ",20172,20328
169,Alas! ,20328,20334
170,alas! ,20334,20340
171,Scarce had he gained the hall than he fell to the ground in great pain. ,20340,20412
172,"Everyone crowded round him, and the two Countesses, terrified now by what they had done, tried in vain to tear the magic vest from his body. ",20412,20553
173,"But he felt that it was too late, the deadly poison had done its work, and, waving them aside, he turned to his brother, who, in great distress, had knelt down and taken him tenderly in his arms. ",20553,20749
174,"""I wronged thee, Paul,"" he gasped. ",20749,20784
175,"""For thou hast ever been true and kind. ",20784,20824
176,"Forgive me in thy thoughts, and,"" he added, gathering up his strength for one last effort, and pointing to the two wretched women who had wrought all this misery, ""_Beware of those two women_, for they seek to take thy life."" ",20824,21050
177,"Then his head sank back on his brother's shoulder, and, with one long sigh, he died. ",21050,21135
178,"When he learned what had happened, and understood where the waistcoat came from, and for what purpose it had been intended, the anger of the Silent Earl knew no bounds. ",21135,21304
179,"He swore a great oath that he would be avenged, not only on Snorro the Dwarf, but also on his wicked step-mother and her cruel sister. ",21304,21439
180,"His vengeance was baulked, however, for in the panic and confusion that followed Harold's death, the two Countesses slipped out of the Palace and fled to the coast, and took boat in haste to Scotland, where they had great possessions, and where they were much looked up to, and where no one would believe a word against them.
