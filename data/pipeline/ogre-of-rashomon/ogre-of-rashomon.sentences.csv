0,"Long, long ago in Kyoto, the people of the city were terrified by accounts of a dreadful ogre, who, it was said, haunted the Gate of Rashomon at twilight and seized whoever passed by. ",0,184
1,"The missing victims were never seen again, so it was whispered that the ogre was a horrible cannibal, who not only killed the unhappy victims but ate them also. ",184,345
2,"Now everybody in the town and neighborhood was in great fear, and no one durst venture out after sunset near the Gate of Rashomon. ",345,476
3,"Now at this time there lived in Kyoto a general named Raiko, who had made himself famous for his brave deeds. ",476,586
4,"Some time before this he made the country ring with his name, for he had attacked Oeyama, where a band of ogres lived with their chief, who instead of wine drank the blood of human beings. ",586,775
5,He had routed them all and cut off the head of the chief monster This brave warrior was always followed by a band of faithful knights. ,775,910
6,In this band there were five knights of great valor. ,910,963
7,"One evening as the five knights sat at a feast quaffing SAKE in their rice bowls and eating all kinds of fish, raw, and stewed, and broiled, and toasting each other's healths and exploits, the first knight, Hojo, said to the others: ""Have you all heard the rumor that every evening after sunset there comes an ogre to the Gate of Rashomon, and that he seizes all who pass by?"" ",963,1340
8,"The second knight, Watanabe, answered him, saying: ""Do not talk such nonsense! ",1340,1419
9,All the ogres were killed by our chief Raiko at Oeyama! ,1419,1475
10,"It cannot be true, because even if any ogres did escape from that great killing they would not dare to show themselves in this city, for they know that our brave master would at once attack them if he knew that any of them were still alive!"" ",1475,1717
11,"""Then do you disbelieve what I say, and think that I am telling you a falsehood?"" ",1717,1799
12,"""No, I do not think that you are telling a lie,"" said Watanabe; ",1799,1863
13," ""but you have heard some old woman's story which is not worth believing."" ",1862,1937
14,"""Then the best plan is to prove what I say, by going there yourself and finding out yourself whether it is true or not,"" said Hojo. ",1937,2069
15,"Watanabe, the second knight, could not bear the thought that his companion should believe he was afraid, so he answered quickly: ""Of course, I will go at once and find out for myself!"" ",2069,2254
16,"So Watanabe at once got ready to go-he buckled on his long sword and put on a coat of armor, and tied on his large helmet. ",2254,2377
17,"When he was ready to start he said to the others: ""Give me something so that I can prove I have been there!"" ",2377,2486
18,"Then one of the men got a roll of writing paper and his box of Indian ink and brushes, and the four comrades wrote their names on a piece of paper. ",2486,2634
19,"""I will take this,"" said Watanabe, ""and put it on the Gate of Rashomon, so to-morrow morning will you all go and look at it? ",2634,2759
20,"I may be able to catch an ogre or two by then!"" ",2759,2807
21,and he mounted his horse and rode off gallantly. ,2807,2856
22,"It was a very dark night, and there was neither moon nor star to light Watanabe on his way. ",2856,2948
23,"To make the darkness worse a storm came on, the rain fell heavily and the wind howled like wolves in the mountains. ",2948,3064
24,"Any ordinary man would have trembled at the thought of going out of doors, but Watanabe was a brave warrior and dauntless, and his honor and word were at stake, so he sped on into the night, while his companions listened to the sound of his horse's hoofs dying away in the distance, then shut the sliding shutters close and gathered round the charcoal fire and wondered what would happen-and whether their comrade would encounter one of those horrible Oni. ",3064,3521
25,"At last Watanabe reached the Gate of Rashomon, but peer as he might through the darkness he could see no sign of an ogre. ",3521,3643
26,"""It is just as I thought,"" said Watanabe to himself; ",3643,3696
27," ""there are certainly no ogres here; ",3695,3732
28, it is only an old woman's story. ,3731,3765
29,"I will stick this paper on the gate so that the others can see I have been here when they come to-morrow, and then I will take my way home and laugh at them all."" ",3765,3928
30,"He fastened the piece of paper, signed by all his four companions, on the gate, and then turned his horse's head towards home. ",3928,4055
31,"As he did so he became aware that some one was behind him, and at the same time a voice called out to him to wait. ",4055,4170
32,Then his helmet was seized from the back. ,4170,4212
33,"""Who are you?"" ",4212,4227
34,said Watanabe fearlessly. ,4227,4253
35,He then put out his hand and groped around to find out who or what it was that held him by the helmet. ,4253,4356
36,As he did so he touched something that felt like an arm-it was covered with hair and as big round as the trunk of a tree! ,4356,4478
37,"Watanabe knew at once that this was the arm of an ogre, so he drew his sword and cut at it fiercely. ",4478,4579
38,"There was a loud yell of pain, and then the ogre dashed in front of the warrior. ",4579,4660
39,"Watanabe's eyes grew large with wonder, for he saw that the ogre was taller than the great gate, his eyes were flashing like mirrors in the sunlight, and his huge mouth was wide open, and as the monster breathed, flames of fire shot out of his mouth. ",4660,4911
40,"The ogre thought to terrify his foe, but Watanabe never flinched. ",4911,4977
41,"He attacked the ogre with all his strength, and thus they fought face to face for a long time. ",4977,5072
42,"At last the ogre, finding that he could neither frighten nor beat Watanabe and that he might himself be beaten, took to flight. ",5072,5200
43,"But Watanabe, determined not to let the monster escape, put spurs to his horse and gave chase. ",5200,5295
44,"But though the knight rode very fast the ogre ran faster, and to his disappointment he found himself unable to overtake the monster, who was gradually lost to sight. ",5295,5461
45,"Watanabe returned to the gate where the fierce fight had taken place, and got down from his horse. ",5461,5560
46,As he did so he stumbled upon something lying on the ground. ,5560,5621
47,Stooping to pick it up he found that it was one of the ogre's huge arms which he must have slashed off in the fight. ,5621,5738
48,"His joy was great at having secured such a prize, for this was the best of all proofs of his adventure with the ogre. ",5738,5856
49,So he took it up carefully and carried it home as a trophy of his victory. ,5856,5931
50,"When he got back, he showed the arm to his comrades, who one and all called him the hero of their band and gave him a great feast. ",5931,6062
51,"His wonderful deed was soon noised abroad in Kyoto, and people from far and near came to see the ogre's arm. ",6062,6171
52,"Watanabe now began to grow uneasy as to how he should keep the arm in safety, for he knew that the ogre to whom it belonged was still alive. ",6171,6312
53,"He felt sure that one day or other, as soon as the ogre got over his scare, he would come to try to get his arm back again. ",6312,6436
54,Watanabe therefore had a box made of the strongest wood and banded with iron. ,6436,6514
55,"In this he placed the arm, and then he sealed down the heavy lid, refusing to open it for anyone. ",6514,6612
56,"He kept the box in his own room and took charge of it himself, never allowing it out of his sight. ",6612,6711
57,"Now one night he heard some one knocking at the porch, asking for admittance. ",6711,6789
58,"When the servant went to the door to see who it was, there was only an old woman, very respectable in appearance. ",6789,6903
59,"On being asked who she was and what was her business, the old woman replied with a smile that she had been nurse to the master of the house when he was a little baby. ",6903,7070
60,If the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him. ,7070,7145
61,The servant left the old woman at the door and went to tell his master that his old nurse had come to see him. ,7145,7256
62,"Watanabe thought it strange that she should come at that time of night, but at the thought of his old nurse, who had been like a foster-mother to him and whom he had not seen for a long time, a very tender feeling sprang up for her in his heart. ",7256,7502
63,He ordered the servant to show her in. ,7502,7541
64,"The old woman was ushered into the room, and after the customary bows and greetings were over, she said: ""Master, the report of your brave fight with the ogre at the Gate of Rashomon is so widely known that even your poor old nurse has heard of it. ",7541,7790
65,"Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms? ",7790,7871
66,"If you did, your deed is highly to be praised!"" ",7871,7919
67,"""I was very disappointed,"" said Watanabe, ""that I was not able take the monster captive, which was what I wished to do, instead of only cutting off an arm!"" ",7919,8076
68,"""I am very proud to think,"" answered the old woman, ""that my master was so brave as to dare to cut off an ogre's arm. ",8076,8194
69,There is nothing that can be compared to your courage. ,8194,8249
70,"Before I die it is the great wish of my life to see this arm,"" she added pleadingly. ",8249,8334
71,"""No,"" said Watanabe, ""I am sorry, but I cannot grant your request."" ",8334,8402
72,"""But why?"" ",8402,8413
73,asked the old woman. ,8413,8434
74,"""Because,"" replied Watanabe, ""ogres are very revengeful creatures, and if I open the box there is no telling but that the ogre may suddenly appear and carry off his arm. ",8434,8604
75,"I have had a box made on purpose with a very strong lid, and in this box I keep the ogre's arm secure; ",8604,8707
76," and I never show it to any one, whatever happens."" ",8706,8758
77,"""Your precaution is very reasonable,"" said the old woman. ",8758,8816
78,"""But I am your old nurse, so surely you will not refuse to show ME the arm. ",8816,8892
79,"I have only just heard of your brave act, and not being able to wait till the morning I came at once to ask you to show it to me."" ",8892,9023
80,"Watanabe was very troubled at the old woman's pleading, but he still persisted in refusing. ",9023,9115
81,"Then the old woman said: ""Do you suspect me of being a spy sent by the ogre?"" ",9115,9193
82,"""No, of course I do not suspect you of being the ogre's spy, for you are my old nurse,"" answered Watanabe. ",9193,9300
83,"""Then you cannot surely refuse to show me the arm any longer."" ",9300,9363
84,entreated the old woman; ,9363,9388
85," ""for it is the great wish of my heart to see for once in my life the arm of an ogre!"" ",9387,9474
86,"Watanabe could not hold out in his refusal any longer, so he gave in at last, saying: ""Then I will show you the ogre's arm, since you so earnestly wish to see it. ",9474,9637
87,"Come, follow me!"" ",9637,9655
88,"and he led the way to his own room, the old woman following. ",9655,9716
89,"When they were both in the room Watanabe shut the door carefully, and then going towards a big box which stood in a corner of the room, he took off the heavy lid. ",9716,9879
90,"He then called to the old woman to come near and look in, for he never took the arm out of the box. ",9879,9979
91,"""What is it like? ",9979,9997
92,"Let me have a good look at it,"" said the old nurse, with a joyful face. ",9997,10069
93,"She came nearer and nearer, as if she were afraid, till she stood right against the box. ",10069,10158
94,"Suddenly she plunged her hand into the box and seized the arm, crying with a fearful voice which made the room shake: ""Oh, joy! ",10158,10286
95,"I have got my arm back again!"" ",10286,10317
96,And from an old woman she was suddenly transformed into the towering figure of the frightful ogre! ,10317,10416
97,"Watanabe sprang back and was unable to move for a moment, so great was his astonishment; ",10416,10505
98," but recognizing the ogre who had attacked him at the Gate of Rashomon, he determined with his usual courage to put an end to him this time. ",10504,10645
99,"He seized his sword, drew it out of its sheath in a flash, and tried to cut the ogre down. ",10645,10736
100,So quick was Watanabe that the creature had a narrow escape. ,10736,10797
101,"But the ogre sprang up to the ceiling, and bursting through the roof, disappeared in the mist and clouds. ",10797,10903
102,In this way the ogre escaped with his arm. ,10903,10946
103,"The knight gnashed his teeth with disappointment, but that was all he could do. ",10946,11026
104,He waited in patience for another opportunity to dispatch the ogre. ,11026,11094
105,"But the latter was afraid of Watanabe's great strength and daring, and never troubled Kyoto again. ",11094,11193
106,"So once more the people of the city were able to go out without fear even at night time, and the brave deeds of Watanabe have never been forgotten!",11193,11341
