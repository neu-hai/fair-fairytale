127,"He made a heap of their feet, a heap of their heads, and a castle of their arms. ",8778,8859

129,"""I'll have a drink before I go further,"" thought he. ",8942,8995
130,With that he stooped down and took a drink of the water. ,8995,9052
131,When he had drunk he lay on the ground and fell asleep. ,9052,9108
132,"Now, there wasn't a morning that the lady in the Green Knight's castle didn't wash in the water of that spring, and she sent a maid for the water each time. ",9108,9265

135,"At last she saw he was asleep, and then she took the water. ",9504,9564
136,Her mistress was complaining of her for being so long. ,9564,9619

145,"The lady did not stop to get any drop of the water on herself, but ran quickly from the castle. ",10007,10103
146,When she came to the spring she roused Lawn Dyarrig. ,10103,10156
147,"If she found him lying, she left him standing. ",10156,10203
148,"She smothered him with kisses, drowned him with tears, dried him with garments of fine silk and with her own hair. ",10203,10318
149,Herself and himself locked arms and walked into the castle of the Green Knight. ,10318,10398
150,After that they were inviting each other with the best food and entertainment till the middle of the following day. ,10398,10514
151,"Then the lady said: ""When the Green Knight bore me away from my father and mother he brought me straight to this castle, but I put him under bonds not to marry me for seven years and a day, and he cannot; ",10514,10719
