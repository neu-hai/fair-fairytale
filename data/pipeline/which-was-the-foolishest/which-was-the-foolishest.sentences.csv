0,"In a little village that stood on a wide plain, where you could see the sun from the moment he rose to the moment he set, there lived two couples side by side. ",0,160
1,"The men, who worked under the same master, were quite good friends, but the wives were always quarrelling, and the subject they quarrelled most about was--which of the two had the stupidest husband. ",160,359
2,Unlike most women--who think that anything that belongs to them must be better than what belongs to anyone else--each thought her husband the more foolish of the two. ,359,526
3,'You should just see what he does!' ,526,562
4,one said to her neighbour. ,562,589
5,"'He puts on the baby's frock upside down, and, one day, I found him trying to feed her with boiling soup, and her mouth was scalded for days after. ",589,737
6,"Then he picks up stones in the road and sows them instead of potatoes, and one day he wanted to go into the garden from the top window, because he declared it was a shorter way than through the door.' ",737,938
7,"'That is bad enough, of course,' answered the other; ",938,991
8, 'but it is really NOTHING to what I have to endure every day from MY husband. ,990,1069
9,"If, when I am busy, I ask him to go and feed the poultry, he is certain to give them some poisonous stuff instead of their proper food, and when I visit the yard next I find them all dead. ",1069,1258
10,"Once he even took my best bonnet, when I had gone away to my sick mother, and when I came back I found he had given it to the hen to lay her eggs in. ",1258,1408
11,"And you know yourself that, only last week, when I sent him to buy a cask of butter, he returned driving a hundred and fifty ducks which someone had induced him to take, and not one of them would lay.' ",1408,1610
12,"'Yes, I am afraid he IS trying,' replied the first; ",1610,1662
13," 'but let us put them to the proof, and see which of them is the most foolish.' ",1661,1741
14,"So, about the time that she expected her husband home from work, she got out her spinning-wheel, and sat busily turning it, taking care not even to look up from her work when the man came in. ",1741,1933
15,"For some minutes he stood with his mouth open watching her, and as she still remained silent, he said at last: 'Have you gone mad, wife, that you sit spinning without anything on the wheel?' ",1933,2124
16,"'YOU may think that there is nothing on it,' answered she, 'but I can assure you that there is a large skein of wool, so fine that nobody can see it, which will be woven into a coat for you.' ",2124,2316
17,'Dear me!' ,2316,2327
18,"he replied, 'what a clever wife I have got! ",2327,2371
19,If you had not told me I should never have known that there was any wool on the wheel at all. ,2371,2465
20,But now I really do seem to see something.' ,2465,2509
21,"The woman smiled and was silent, and after spinning busily for an hour more, she got up from her stoop, and began to weave as fast as she could. ",2509,2654
22,"At last she got up, and said to her husband: 'I am too tired to finish it to-night, so I shall go to bed, and to-morrow I shall only have the cutting and stitching to do.' ",2654,2826
23,"So the next morning she got up early, and after she had cleaned her house, and fed her chickens, and put everything in its place again, she bent over the kitchen table, and the sound of her big scissors might be heard snip! ",2826,3050
24,snap! ,3050,3056
25,as far as the garden. ,3056,3078
26,Her husband could not see anything to snip at; ,3078,3125
27, but then he was so stupid that was not surprising! ,3124,3176
28,After the cutting came the sewing. ,3176,3211
29,"The woman patted and pinned and fixed and joined, and then, turning to the man, she said: 'Now it is ready for you to try on.' ",3211,3338
30,"And she made him take off his coat, and stand up in front of her, and once more she patted an pinned and fixed and joined, and was very careful in smoothing out every wrinkle. ",3338,3514
31,"'It does not feel very warm,' observed the man at last, when he had borne all this patiently for a long time. ",3514,3624
32,"'That is because it is so fine,' answered she; ",3624,3671
33, 'you do not want it to be as thick as the rough clothes you wear every day.' ,3670,3748
34,"He DID, but was ashamed to say so, and only answered: 'Well, I am sure it must be beautiful since you say so, and I shall be smarter than anyone in the whole village. ",3748,3915
35,"""What a splendid coat!"" ",3915,3939
36,they will exclaim when they see me. ,3939,3975
37,But it is not everybody who has a wife as clever as mine.' ,3975,4034
38,Meanwhile the other wife was not idle. ,4034,4073
39,As soon as her husband entered she looked at him with such a look of terror that the poor man was quite frightened. ,4073,4189
40,'Why do you stare at me so? ,4189,4217
41,Is there anything the matter?' ,4217,4248
42,asked he. ,4248,4258
43,'Oh! ,4258,4263
44,"go to bed at once,' she cried; ",4263,4294
45, 'you must be very ill indeed to look like that!' ,4293,4343
46,"The man was rather surprised at first, as he felt particularly well that evening; ",4343,4425
47," but the moment his wife spoke he became quite certain that he had something dreadful the matter with him, and grew quite pale. ",4424,4552
48,"'I dare say it would be the best place for me,' he answered, trembling; ",4552,4624
49," and he suffered his wife to take him upstairs, and to help him off with his clothes. ",4623,4709
50,"'If you sleep well during the might there MAY be a chance for you,' said she, shaking her head, as she tucked him up warmly; ",4709,4834
51, 'but if not--' And of course the poor man never closed an eye till the sun rose. ,4833,4915
52,'How do you feel this morning?' ,4915,4947
53,"asked the woman, coming in on tip-toe when her house-work was finished. ",4947,5019
54,"'Oh, bad; ",5019,5029
55," very bad indeed,' answered he; ",5028,5060
56, 'I have not slept for a moment. ,5059,5092
57,Can you think of nothing to make me better?' ,5092,5137
58,"'I will try everything that is possible,' said the wife, who did not in the least wish her husband to die, but was determined to show that he was more foolish that the other man. ",5137,5316
59,"'I will get some dried herbs and make you a drink, but I am very much afraid that it is too late. ",5316,5414
60,Why did you not tell me before?' ,5414,5447
61,'I thought perhaps the pain would go off in a day or two; ,5447,5505
62," and, besides, I did not want to make you unhappy,' answered the man, who was by this time quite sure he had been suffering tortures, and had borne them like a hero. ",5504,5670
63,"'Of course, if I had had any idea how ill I really was, I should have spoken at once.' ",5670,5757
64,"'Well, well, I will see what can be done,' said the wife, 'but talking is not good for you. ",5757,5849
65,"Lie still, and keep yourself warm.' ",5849,5885
66,"All that day the man lay in bed, and whenever his wife entered the room and asked him, with a shake of the head, how he felt, he always replied that he was getting worse. ",5885,6056
67,"At last, in the evening, she burst into tears, and when he inquired what was the matter, she sobbed out: 'Oh, my poor, poor husband, are you really dead? ",6056,6210
68,I must go to-morrow and order your coffin.' ,6210,6254
69,"Now, when the man heard this, a cold shiver ran through his body, and all at once he knew that he was as well as he had ever been in his life. ",6254,6397
70,"'Oh, no, no!' ",6397,6411
71,"he cried, 'I feel quite recovered! ",6411,6446
72,"Indeed, I think I shall go out to work.' ",6446,6487
73,"'You will do no such thing,' replied his wife. ",6487,6534
74,"'Just keep quite quiet, for before the sun rises you will be a dead man.' ",6534,6608
75,"The man was very frightened at her words, and lay absolutely still while the undertaker came and measured him for his coffin; ",6608,6734
76, and his wife gave orders to the gravedigger about his grave. ,6733,6795
77,"That evening the coffin was sent home, and in the morning at nine o'clock the woman put him on a long flannel garment, and called to the undertaker's men to fasten down the lid and carry him to the grave, where all their friends were waiting them. ",6795,7043
78,"Just as the body was being placed in the ground the other woman's husband came running up, dressed, as far as anyone could see, in no clothes at all. ",7043,7193
79,"Everybody burst into shouts of laughter at the sight of him, and the men laid down the coffin and laughed too, till their sides nearly split. ",7193,7335
80,"The dead man was so astonished at this behaviour, that he peeped out of a little window in the side of the coffin, and cried out: 'I should laugh as loudly as any of you, if I were not a dead man.' ",7335,7533
81,"When they heard the voice coming from the coffin the other people suddenly stopped laughing, and stood as if they had been turned into stone. ",7533,7675
82,"Then they rushed with one accord to the coffin, and lifted the lid so that the man could step out amongst them. ",7675,7787
83,'Were you really not dead after all?' ,7787,7825
84,asked they. ,7825,7837
85,"'And if not, why did you let yourself be buried?' ",7837,7887
86,At this the wives both confessed that they had each wished to prove that her husband was stupider than the other. ,7887,8001
87,"But the villagers declared that they could not decide which was the most foolish--the man who allowed himself to be persuaded that he was wearing fine clothes when he was dressed in nothing, or the man who let himself be buried when he was alive and well. ",8001,8257
88,"So the women quarrelled just as much as they did before, and no one ever knew whose husband was the most foolish.",8257,8371
