0,"It so happened that Finn and his gigantic relatives were all working at the Giant's Causeway in order to make a bridge, or, what was still better, a good stout pad-road across to Scotland. ",0,189
1,"Finn, who was very fond of his wife, Oonagh, took it into his head that he would go home and see how the poor woman got on in his absence. ",189,328
2,"So accordingly he pulled up a fir-tree, and after lopping off the roots and branches, made a walking-stick of it and set out on his way to Oonagh. ",328,475
3,"Finn lived at this time on Knockmany Hill, which faces Cullamore, that rises up, half hill, half mountain, on the opposite side. ",475,604
4,The truth is that honest Finn's affection for his wife was by no manner of means the whole cause of his journey home. ,604,722
5,"There was at that time another giant, named Far Rua--some say he was Irish and some say he was Scotch--but whether Scotch or Irish, sorrow doubt of it but he was a targer. ",722,894
6,No other giant of the day could stand before him. ,894,944
7,"Such was his strength that, when well vexed, he could give a stamp that shook the country about him. ",944,1045
8,"The fame and name of him went far and near, and nothing in the shape of a man, it was said, had any chance with him in a fight. ",1045,1173
9,"Whether the story is true or not I cannot say, but the report went that by one blow of his fist he flattened a thunderbolt, and kept it in his pocket in the shape of a pancake to show to all his enemies when they were about to fight him. ",1173,1411
10,"Undoubtedly he had given every giant in Ireland a considerable beating, barring Finn M'Coul himself. ",1411,1512
11,"He swore that he would never rest night or day, winter or summer, till he could serve Finn with the same sauce, if he could catch him. ",1512,1647
12,"Finn, however, had a strong disinclination to meet a giant who could make a young earthquake or flatten a thunderbolt when he was angry. ",1647,1784
13,"Accordingly he kept dodging about from place to place--not much to his credit as a Trojan, to be sure--whenever he happened to get the hard word that Far Rua was on the scent of him. ",1784,1967
14,And the long and the short of it was that he heard Far Rua was coming to the Causeway to have a trial of strength with him. ,1967,2091
15,"He was, naturally enough, seized in consequence with a very warm and sudden fit of affection for his wife, who was delicate in her health, poor woman. ",2091,2242
16,"She was leading, besides, a very lonely, uncomfortable life of it in his absence. ",2242,2324
17,"""God save all here,"" said Finn good-humouredly, putting his honest face into his own door. ",2324,2415
18,"""Musha, Finn, avick, an' you're welcome to your own Oonagh, you darlin' bully."" ",2415,2495
19,"Here followed a smack that it is said to have made the waters of the lake curl, as it were, with kindness and sympathy. ",2495,2615
20,"""Faith,"" said Finn, ""beautiful; ",2615,2647
21," and how are you, Oonagh--and how did you sport your figure during my absence, my bilberry?"" ",2646,2739
22,"""Never a merrier--as bouncing a grass widow as ever there was in sweet 'Tyrone among the bushes.'"" ",2739,2838
23,"Finn gave a short, good-humoured cough. ",2838,2878
24,He laughed most heartily to show her how much he was delighted that she made herself happy in his absence. ,2878,2985
25,"""An' what brought you home so soon, Finn?"" ",2985,3028
26,said she. ,3028,3038
27,"""Why, avourneen,"" said Finn, putting in his answer in the proper way, ""never the thing but the purest of love and affection for yourself. ",3038,3176
28,"Sure, you know that's truth, anyhow, Oonagh."" ",3176,3222
29,"Finn spent two or three happy days with Oonagh, and felt himself very comfortable considering the dread he had of Far Rua. ",3222,3345
30,"This, however, grew upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive something lay on his mind which he kept altogether to himself. ",3345,3482
31,Let a woman alone in the meantime for ferreting or wheedling a secret out of her good man when she wishes. ,3482,3589
32,Finn was a proof of this. ,3589,3615
33,"""It's this Far Rua,"" said he, ""that's troublin' me. ",3615,3667
34,When the fellow gets angry and begins to stamp he'll shake you a whole townland. ,3667,3748
35,"It's well known that he can stop a thunderbolt, for he always carries one about with him in the shape of a pancake to show to anyone that might misdoubt it."" ",3748,3906
36,"As he spoke he clapped his thumb in his mouth, as he always did when he wanted to prophesy or to know anything. ",3906,4018
37,"""He's coming,"" said Finn. ",4018,4044
38,"""I see him below at Dungannon."" ",4044,4076
39,"""An' who is it, avick?"" ",4076,4100
40,"""Far Rua,"" replied Finn, ""and how to manage I don't know. ",4100,4158
41,"If I run away I am disgraced, and I know that sooner or later I must meet him, for my thumb tells me so."" ",4158,4264
42,"""When will he be here?"" ",4264,4288
43,says she. ,4288,4298
44,"""To-morrow, about two o'clock,"" replied Finn with a groan. ",4298,4357
45,"""Don't be cast down,"" said Oonagh. ",4357,4392
46,"""Depend on me, and, maybe, I'll bring you out of this scrape better than ever you could bring yourself."" ",4392,4497
47,"This quieted Finn's heart very much, for he knew that Oonagh was hand-and-glove with the fairies. ",4497,4595
48,"Indeed, to tell the truth, she was supposed to be a fairy herself. ",4595,4662
49,"If she was, however, she must have been a kind-hearted one, for by all accounts she never did anything but good in the neighbourhood. ",4662,4796
50,"Now, it so happened that Oonagh had a sister named Granua living opposite to them, on the very top of Cullamore, which I have mentioned already. ",4796,4941
51,This Granua was quite as powerful as herself. ,4941,4987
52,"The beautiful valley that lies between the Granlisses is not more than three or four miles broad, so that of a summer evening Granua and Oonagh were able to hold many an agreeable conversation across it, from one hill-top to the other. ",4987,5223
53,Upon this occasion Oonagh resolved to consult her sister as to what was best to be done in the difficulty that surrounded them. ,5223,5351
54,"""Granua,"" said she, ""are you at home?"" ",5351,5390
55,"""No,"" said the other, ""I'm picking bilberries at Althadhawan"" (the Devil's Glen). ",5390,5472
56,"""Well,"" said Oonagh, ""go up to the top of Cullamore, look about you, and then tell us what you see."" ",5472,5573
57,"""Very well,"" replied Granua, after a few minutes; ",5573,5623
58," ""I am there now."" ",5622,5641
59,"""What do you see?"" ",5641,5660
60,asked the other. ,5660,5677
61,"""Goodness be about us!"" ",5677,5701
62,"exclaimed Granua, ""I see the biggest giant that ever was known coming up from Dungannon."" ",5701,5791
63,"""Ay,"" said Oonagh, ""there's our difficulty. ",5791,5835
64,"That's Far Rua, and he's comin' up now to leather Finn. ",5835,5891
65,"What's to be done?"" ",5891,5911
66,"""I'll call to him,"" she replied, ""to come up to Cullamore and refresh himself, and maybe that will give you and Finn time to think of some plan to get yourselves out of the scrape. ",5911,6092
67,"But,"" she proceeded, ""I'm short of butter, having in the house only half a dozen firkins, and as I'm to have a few giants and giantesses to spend the evenin' with me I'd feel thankful, Oonagh, if you'd throw me up fifteen or sixteen tubs, or the largest miscaun you've got, and you'll oblige me very much."" ",6092,6399
68,"""I'll do that with a heart and a half,"" replied Oonagh; ",6399,6455
69," ""and, indeed, Granua, I feel myself under great obligations to you for your kindness in keeping him off us till we see what can be done; ",6454,6592
70," for what would become of us all if anything happened to Finn, poor man!"" ",6591,6665
71,"She accordingly got the largest miscaun of butter she had--which might be about the weight of a couple of dozen millstones, so that you can easily judge of its size--and calling up her sister, ""Granua,"" says she, ""are you ready? ",6665,6894
72,"I'm going to throw you up a miscaun, so be prepared to catch it."" ",6894,6960
73,"""I will,"" said the other. ",6960,6986
74,"""A good throw, now, and take care it does not fall short."" ",6986,7045
75,"Oonagh threw it, but in consequence of her anxiety about Finn and Far Rua she forgot to say the charm that was to send it up, so that instead of reaching Cullamore, as she expected, it fell about half-way between the two hills at the edge of the Broad Bog, near Augher. ",7045,7315
76,"""My curse upon you!"" ",7315,7336
77,"she exclaimed, ""you've disgraced me. ",7336,7373
78,I now change you into a grey stone. ,7373,7409
79,"Lie there as a testimony of what has happened, and may evil betide the first living man that will ever attempt to move or injure you!"" ",7409,7544
80,"And, sure enough, there it lies to this day, with the mark of the four fingers and thumb imprinted on it, exactly as it came out of her hand. ",7544,7686
81,"""Never mind,"" said Granua, ""I must only do the best I can with Far Rua. ",7686,7758
82,"If all fail, I'll give him a cast of heather broth, or a panada of oak bark. ",7758,7835
83,"But, above all things, think of some plan to get Finn out of the scrape he's in, or he's a lost man. ",7835,7936
84,You know you used to be sharp and ready-witted; ,7936,7984
85," and my own opinion is, Oonagh, that it will go hard with you, or you'll outdo Far Rua yet."" ",7983,8076
86,"She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill, after which she put her finger in her mouth and gave three whistles, and by that Far Rua knew that he was invited to the top of Cullamore--for this was the way that the Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers to let them know they are welcome to come and take share of whatever was going. ",8076,8435
87,"In the meantime Finn was very melancholy, and did not know what to do, or how to act at all. ",8435,8528
88,"Far Rua was an ugly customer, no doubt, to meet with; ",8528,8582
89," and, moreover, the idea of the confounded ""cake"" aforesaid flattened the very heart within him. ",8581,8678
90,"What chance could he have, strong and brave as he was, with a man who could, when put in a passion, walk the country into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes? ",8678,8850
91,"The thing was impossible, and Finn knew not on what hand to turn him. ",8850,8920
92,"Right or left, backward or forward, where to go he could form no guess whatever. ",8920,9001
93,"""Oonagh,"" said he, ""can you do anything for me? ",9001,9049
94,Where's all your invention? ,9049,9077
95,"Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes and to have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe, and me the best man among them? ",9077,9229
96,"How am I to fight this man-mountain--this huge cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt--with a pancake in his pocket that was once----?"" ",9229,9372
97,"""Be aisy, Finn,"" replied Oonagh. ",9372,9405
98,"""Troth, I'm ashamed of you. ",9405,9433
99,"Keep your toe in your pump, will you? ",9433,9471
100,"Talking of pancakes, maybe we'll give him as good as any he brings with him--thunderbolts or otherwise. ",9471,9575
101,"If I don't treat him to as smart feeding as he's got this many a day, don't trust Oonagh again. ",9575,9671
102,"Leave him to me, and do just as I bid you."" ",9671,9715
103,"This relieved Finn very much, for, after all, he had great confidence in his wife, knowing, as he did, that she had got him out of many a quandary before. ",9715,9870
104,"The present, however, was the greatest of all; ",9870,9917
105," but, still, he began to get courage and to eat his victuals as usual. ",9916,9987
106,"Oonagh then drew the nine woollen threads of different colours, which she always did to find out the best way of succeeding in anything of importance she went about. ",9987,10153
107,"She then plaited them into three plaits, with three colours in each, putting one on her right arm, one round her heart, and the third round her right ankle, for then she knew that nothing could fail her that she undertook. ",10153,10376
108,"Having everything now prepared, she sent round to the neighbours and borrowed one-and-twenty iron griddles, which she took and kneaded into the hearts of one-and-twenty cakes of bread, and these she baked on the fire in the usual way, setting them aside in the cupboard according as they were done. ",10376,10675
109,"She then put down a large pot of new milk, which she made into curds and whey, and gave Finn due instructions how to use the curds when Far Rua should come. ",10675,10832
110,"Having done all this, she sat down quite contented waiting for his arrival on the next day about two o'clock, that being the hour at which he was expected--for Finn knew as much by the sucking of his thumb. ",10832,11039
111,"Now, this was a curious property that Finn's thumb had; ",11039,11095
112," but notwithstanding all the wisdom and logic he used to suck out of it, it could never have stood to him here were it not for the wit of his wife. ",11094,11242
113,"In this very thing, moreover, he was very much resembled by his great foe, Far Rua; ",11242,11326
114," for it was well known that the huge strength that he possessed all lay in the middle finger of his right hand, and that if he happened by any chance to lose it, he was no more, notwithstanding his bulk, than a common man. ",11325,11548
115,"At length the next day he was seen coming across the valley, and Oonagh knew that it was time to commence operations. ",11548,11666
116,"She immediately made the cradle, and desired Finn to lie down in it and cover himself up with the clothes. ",11666,11773
117,"""You must pass for your own child,"" said she, ""so just lie there snug and say nothing, but be guided by me."" ",11773,11882
118,"This, to be sure, was wormwood to Finn--I mean going into the cradle in such a cowardly manner--but he knew Oonagh very well; ",11882,12008
119," and finding that he had nothing else for it, with a very rueful face he gathered himself into it and lay snug, as she had desired him. ",12007,12143
120,"About two o'clock, as he had been expected, Far Rua came in. ",12143,12204
121,"""God save all here!"" ",12204,12225
122,said he. ,12225,12234
123,"""Is this where the great Finn M'Coul lives?"" ",12234,12279
124,"""Indeed it is, honest man,"" replied Oonagh. ",12279,12323
125,"""God save you kindly--won't you be sitting?"" ",12323,12368
126,"""Thank you, ma'am,"" says he, sitting down. ",12368,12411
127,"""You're Mrs. M'Coul, I suppose?"" ",12411,12444
128,"""I am,"" says she, ""and I have no reason, I hope, to be ashamed of my husband."" ",12444,12523
129,"""No,"" said the other; ",12523,12545
130," ""he has the name of being the strongest and bravest man in Ireland. ",12544,12613
131,"But, for all that, there's a man not far from you that's very anxious of taking a shake with him. ",12613,12711
132,"Is he at home?"" ",12711,12727
133,"""Why, no, then,"" she replied; ",12727,12757
134," ""and if ever a man left in a fury he did. ",12756,12799
135,"It appears that someone told him of a big bosthoon of a giant called Far Rua being down at the Causeway to look for him, and so he set out there to try if he could catch him. ",12799,12974
136,"Troth, I hope, for the poor giant's sake, he won't meet with him, for if he does Finn will make paste of him at once."" ",12974,13093
137,"""Well,"" said the other, ""I am Far Rua, and I have been seeking him these twelve minths, but he always kept clear of me; ",13093,13213
138," and I will never rest day or night till I lay my hands on him."" ",13212,13277
139,"At this Oonagh set up a loud laugh of great contempt, by the way, and looked at him as if he were only a mere handful of a man. ",13277,13405
140,"""Did you ever see Finn?"" ",13405,13430
141,"said she, changing her manner all at once. ",13430,13473
142,"""How could I?"" ",13473,13488
143,said he. ,12225,12234
144,"""He always took care to keep his distance."" ",13497,13541
145,"""I thought so,"" she replied. ",13541,13570
146,"""I judged as much; ",13570,13589
147," and if you take my advice, you poor-looking creature, you'll pray night and day that you may never see him, for I tell you it will be a black day for you when you do. ",13588,13756
148,"But, in the meantime, you perceive that the wind's on the door, and as Finn himself is far from home, maybe you'd be civil enough to turn the house, for it's always what Finn does when he's here."" ",13756,13953
149,"This was a startler, even to Far Rua; ",13953,13991
150," but he got up, however, and after pulling the middle finger of his right hand until it cracked three times, he went outside, and getting his arms about the house, completely turned it as she had wished. ",13990,14194
151,"When Finn saw this he felt a certain description of moisture, which shall be nameless, oozing out through every pore of his skin; ",14194,14324
152," but Oonagh, depending upon her woman's wit, felt not a whit daunted. ",14323,14393
153,"""Arrah, then,"" said she, ""as you're so civil, maybe you'd do another obliging turn for us, as Finn's not here to do it himself. ",14393,14521
154,"You see, after this long stretch of dry weather that we've had, we feel very badly off for want of water. ",14521,14627
155,"Now, Finn says there's a fine spring well somewhere under the rocks behind the hill there below, and it was his intention to pull them asunder; ",14627,14771
156, but having heard of you he left the place in such a fury that he never thought of it. ,14770,14857
157,"Now, if you try to find it, troth, I'd feel it a kindness."" ",14857,14917
158,"She then brought Far Rua down to see the place, which was then all one solid rock; ",14917,15000
159," and after looking at it for some time, he cracked his right middle finger nine times, and, stooping down, tore a cleft about four hundred feet deep and a quarter of a mile in length, which has since been christened by the name of Lumford's Glen. ",14999,15246
160,This feat nearly threw Oonagh herself off her guard; ,15246,15299
161, but what won't a woman's sagacity and presence of mind accomplish? ,15298,15366
162,"""You'll now come in,"" said she, ""and eat a bit of such humble fare as we can give. ",15366,15449
163,"Finn, even though you and he were enemies, would scorn not to treat you kindly in his own house; ",15449,15546
164," and, indeed, if I didn't do it even in his absence, he would not be pleased with me."" ",15545,15632
165,"She accordingly brought him in, and placing half a dozen of the cakes we spoke of before him, together with a can or two of butter, a side of boiled bacon, and a stack of cabbage, she desired him to help himself--for this, be it known, was long before the invention of potatoes. ",15632,15911
166,"Far Rua, who, by the way, was a glutton as well as a hero, put one of the cakes in his mouth to take a huge whack out of it, when both Finn and Oonagh were stunned with a noise that resembled something between a growl and a yell. ",15911,16141
167,"""Blood and fury!"" ",16141,16159
168,he shouted out. ,16159,16175
169,"""How is this? ",16175,16189
170,Here are two of my teeth out! ,16189,16219
171,"What kind of bread is this you gave me?"" ",16219,16260
172,"""What's the matter?"" ",16260,16281
173,said Oonagh coolly. ,16281,16301
174,"""Matter!"" ",16301,16311
175,shouted the other. ,16311,16330
176,"""Why, here are two of the best teeth in my head gone."" ",16330,16385
177,"""Why,"" said she, ""that's Finn's bread--the only bread he ever eats when at home; ",16385,16466
178," but, indeed, I forgot to tell you that nobody can eat it but himself and that child in the cradle there. ",16465,16571
179,"I thought, however, that as you were reported to be rather a stout little fellow of your size you might be able to manage it, and I did not wish to affront a man that thinks himself able to fight Finn. ",16571,16773
180,"Here's another cake--maybe it's not so hard as that."" ",16773,16827
181,"Far Rua, at the moment, was not only hungry, but ravenous, so he accordingly made a fresh set at the second cake, and immediately another yell was heard twice as loud as the first. ",16827,17008
182,"""Thunder and giblets!"" ",17008,17031
183,"he roared, ""take your bread out of this, or I will not have a tooth in my head; ",17031,17111
184," there's another pair of them gone."" ",17110,17147
185,"""Well, honest man,"" replied Oonagh, ""if you're not able to eat the bread say so quietly, and don't be awakening the child in the cradle there. ",17147,17290
186,"There, now, he's awake upon me!"" ",17290,17323
187,"Finn now gave a skirl that frightened the giant, as coming from such a youngster as he was represented to be. ",17323,17433
188,"""Mother,"" said he, ""I'm hungry--get me something to eat."" ",17433,17491
189,"Oonagh went over, and putting into his hand a cake that had no griddle in it--Finn, whose appetite in the meantime was sharpened by what he saw going forward, soon made it disappear. ",17491,17674
190,"Far Rua was thunderstruck, and secretly thanked his stars that he had the good fortune to miss meeting Finn, for, as he said to himself, I'd have no chance with a man who could eat such bread as that, which even his son that's in the cradle can munch before my eyes. ",17674,17941
191,"""I'd like to take a glimpse at the lad in the cradle,"" said he to Oonagh, ""for I can tell you that the infant who can manage that nutriment is no joke to look at or to feed of a scarce summer."" ",17941,18135
192,"""With all the veins of my heart,"" replied Oonagh. ",18135,18185
193,"""Get up, acushla, and show this decent little man something that won't be unworthy of your father, Finn M'Coul."" ",18185,18298
194,"Finn, who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as possible, got up, and bringing Far Rua out, ""Are you strong?"" ",18298,18421
195,said he. ,12225,12234
196,"""Thunder and ounze!"" ",18430,18451
197,"exclaimed the other, ""what a voice in so small a chap!"" ",18451,18507
198,"""Are you strong?"" ",18403,18421
199,said Finn again. ,18525,18542
200,"""Are you able to squeeze water out of that white stone?"" ",18542,18599
201,"he asked, putting one into Far Rua's hand. ",18599,18642
202,"The latter squeezed and squeezed the stone, but to no purpose; ",18642,18705
203," he might pull the rocks of Lumford's Glen asunder, and flatten a thunderbolt, but to squeeze water out of a white stone was beyond his strength. ",18704,18850
204,Finn eyed him with great contempt as he kept straining and squeezing and squeezing and straining till he got black in the face with the efforts. ,18850,18995
205,"""Ah, you're a poor creature,"" said Finn. ",18995,19036
206,"""You a giant! ",19036,19050
207,"Give me the stone here, and when I'll show what Finn's little son can do you may then judge of what my daddy himself is."" ",19050,19172
208,"Finn then took the stone, and then, slyly exchanging it for the curds, he squeezed the latter until the whey, as clear as water, oozed out in a little shower from his hand. ",19172,19345
209,"""I'll now go in,"" said he, ""to my cradle; ",19345,19387
210," for I scorn to lose my time with anyone that's not able to eat my daddy's bread, or squeeze water out of a stone. ",19386,19501
211,"Bedad, you had better be off out of this before he comes back, for if he catches you, it's in flummery he'd have you in two minutes."" ",19501,19635
212,"Far Rua, seeing what he had seen, was of the same opinion himself; ",19635,19702
213," his knees knocked together with the terror of Finn's return, and he accordingly hastened in to bid Oonagh farewell, and to assure her that, from that day out, he never wished to hear of, much less to see, her husband. ",19701,19920
214,"""I admit fairly that I'm not a match for him,"" said he, ""strong as I am. ",19920,19993
215,"Tell him I will avoid him as I would the plague, and that I will make myself scarce in this part of the country while I live."" ",19993,20120
216,"Finn, in the meantime, had gone into the cradle, where he lay very quietly, his heart in his mouth with delight that Far Rua was about to take his departure without discovering the tricks that been played off on him. ",20120,20337
217,"""It's well for you,"" said Oonagh, ""that he doesn't happen to be here, for it's nothing but hawk's meat he'd make of you."" ",20337,20459
218,"""I know that,"" said Far Rua, ""divel a thing else he'd make of me; ",20459,20525
219," but, before I go, will you let me feel what kind of teeth they are that can eat griddle-cakes like that?"" ",20524,20631
220,and he pointed to it as he spoke. ,20631,20665
221,"""With all the pleasure in life,"" says she; ",20665,20708
222," ""only as they're far back in his head you must put your finger a good way in."" ",20707,20787
223,Far Rua was surprised to find so powerful a set of grinders in one so young; ,20787,20864
224," but he was still much more so on finding, when he took his hand from Finn's mouth, that he had left the very finger upon which his whole strength depended behind him. ",20863,21031
225,He gave one loud groan and fell down at once with terror and weakness. ,21031,21102
226,"This was all Finn wanted, who now knew that his most powerful and bitterest enemy was completely at his mercy. ",21102,21213
227,"He instantly started out of the cradle, and in a few minutes the great Far Rua, that was for such a length of time the terror of him and all his followers, was no more.",21213,21382
