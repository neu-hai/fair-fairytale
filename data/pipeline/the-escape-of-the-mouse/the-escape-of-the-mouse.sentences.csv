0,Manawyddan the prince and his friend Pryderi were wanderers. ,0,61
1,The brother of Manawyddan had been slain. ,61,103
2,His throne was taken from him. ,103,134
3,"Very sorrowful was Manawyddan, but Pryderi was stout of heart, and bade him be of good cheer. ",134,228
4,He knew a way out of his trouble. ,228,262
5,'And what may that be?' ,262,286
6,asked Manawyddan. ,286,304
7,'It is that thou marry my mother Rhiannon and become lord of the fair lands that I will give her for dowry. ,304,412
8,Never did any lady have more wit than she. ,412,455
9,In her youth none was more lovely; ,455,490
10, even yet she is good to look upon.' ,489,526
11,"'Thou art the best friend that ever a man had,' said Manawyddan. ",526,591
12,"'Let us go now to seek Rhiannon, and the lands where she dwells.' ",591,657
13,"Then they set forth, but the news of their coming ran swifter still. ",657,726
14,"Rhiannon and Kieva, wife of Pryderi, made haste to prepare a feast for them. ",726,803
15,"And Manawyddan found that Pryderi had spoken the truth concerning his mother, and asked if she would take him for her husband. ",803,930
16,"Right gladly did she consent, and without delay they were married, and rode away to the hunt, Rhiannon and Manawyddan, Kieva and Pryderi. ",930,1068
17,"They would not be parted from each other by night or by day, so great was the love between them. ",1068,1165
18,"One day, when they were returned, they were sitting out in a green place. ",1165,1239
19,Suddenly the crash of thunder struck loudly on their ears. ,1239,1298
20,"A wall of mist fell between them, so that they were hidden one from the other. ",1298,1377
21,Trembling they sat till the darkness fled and the light shone again upon them. ,1377,1456
22,"In the place where they were wont to see cattle, and herds, and dwellings, they beheld neither house nor beast, nor man nor smoke. ",1456,1587
23,Neither was any one remaining in the green place save these four only. ,1587,1658
24,"'Whither have they gone, and my host also?' ",1658,1702
25,cried Manawyddan. ,1702,1720
26,"They searched the hall, and there was no man, and the castle, and there was none. ",1720,1802
27,In the dwellings that were left was nothing save wild beasts. ,1802,1864
28,"For a year these four fed on the meat that Manawyddan and Pryderi killed out hunting, and the honey of the bees that sucked the mountain heather. ",1864,2010
29,"For a time they desired nothing more, but when the next year began they grew weary. ",2010,2094
30,"'We cannot spend our lives thus,' said Manawyddan at last, 'let us go into England and learn some trade by which we may live.' ",2094,2221
31,"So they left Wales, and went to Hereford. ",2221,2263
32,"There they made saddles, while Manawyddan fashioned blue enamel ornaments to put on their trappings. ",2263,2364
33,And so greatly did the townsfolk love these saddles. ,2364,2417
34,"No others were bought throughout the whole of Hereford, till the saddlers banded together and resolved to slay Manawyddan and his companions. ",2417,2559
35,"When Pryderi heard of it, he was very wroth, and wished to stay and fight. ",2559,2634
36,But the counsels of Manawyddan prevailed. ,2634,2676
37,They moved by night to another city. ,2676,2713
38,'What craft shall we follow?' ,2713,2743
39,asked Pryderi. ,2743,2758
40,"'We will make shields,' answered Manawyddan. ",2758,2803
41,'But do we know anything of that craft?' ,2803,2844
42,answered Pryderi. ,2844,2862
43,"'We will try it,' said Manawyddan. ",2862,2897
44,"They began to make shields, and fashioned them after the shape of the shields they had seen. ",2897,2990
45,These likewise they enamelled. ,2990,3021
46,And so greatly did they prosper that no man in the town bought a shield except they had made it. ,3021,3118
47,"The shield-makers banded together as the saddlers had done, and resolved to slay them. ",3118,3205
48,"But of this they had warning, and by night betook themselves to another town. ",3205,3283
49,"'Let us take to making shoes,' said Manawyddan, 'for there are not any among the shoemakers bold enough to fight us.' ",3283,3401
50,"'I know nothing of making shoes,' answered Pryderi, who in truth despised so peaceful a craft. ",3401,3496
51,"'But I know,' replied Manawyddan, 'and I will teach thee to stitch. ",3496,3564
52,"We will buy the leather ready dressed, and will make the shoes from it.' ",3564,3637
53,"Then straightway he sought the town for the best leather, and for a goldsmith to fashion the clasps. ",3637,3738
54,"He himself watched till it was done, so that he might learn for himself. ",3738,3811
55,"Soon he became known as 'The Maker of Gold Shoes,' and prospered so greatly, that as long as one could be bought from him not a shoe was purchased from the shoemakers of the town. ",3811,3991
56,"And the craftsmen were wroth, and banded together to slay them. ",3991,4055
57,"'Pryderi,' said Manawyddan, when he had received news of it, 'we will not remain in England any longer. ",4055,4159
58,Let us set forth to Dyved.' ,4159,4187
59,So they journeyed until they came to their lands at Narberth. ,4187,4249
60,"There they gathered their dogs round them, and hunted for a year as before. ",4249,4325
61,After that a strange thing happened. ,4325,4362
62,"One morning Pryderi and Manawyddan rose up to hunt, and loosened their dogs, which ran before them. ",4362,4462
63,They came to a small bush. ,4462,4489
64,"At the bush, the dogs shrank away as if frightened. ",4489,4541
65,"They returned to their masters, their hair brisling on their backs. ",4541,4609
66,"'We must see what is in that bush,' said Pryderi, and what was in it was a boar, with a skin as white as the snow on the mountains. ",4609,4741
67,"And he came out, and made a stand as the dogs rushed on him, driven on by the men. ",4741,4824
68,Long he stood at bay. ,4824,4846
69,"Then at last he betook himself to flight, and fled to a castle which was newly built, in a place where no building had ever been known. ",4846,4982
70,"Into the castle he ran, and the dogs after him, and long though their masters looked and listened. ",4982,5081
71,They neither saw nor heard aught concerning dogs or boar. ,5081,5139
72,"'I will go into the castle and get tidings of the dogs,' said Pryderi at last. ",5139,5218
73,"'Truly,' answered Manawyddan, 'thou wouldst do unwisely, for whosoever has cast a spell over this land has set this castle here.' ",5218,5348
74,"'I cannot give up my dogs,' replied Pryderi, and to the castle he went. ",5348,5420
75,But within was neither man nor beast; ,5420,5458
76," neither boar nor dogs, but only a fountain with marble round it, and on the edge a golden bowl, richly wrought, which pleased Pryderi greatly. ",5457,5601
77,"In a moment he forgot about his dogs, and went up to the bowl and took hold of it. ",5601,5684
78,"His hands stuck to the bowl, and his feet to the marble slab, and despair took possession of him. ",5684,5782
79,Till the close of day Manawyddan waited for him. ,5782,5831
80,"When the sun was fast sinking, he went home, thinking that he had strayed far. ",5831,5910
81,'Where are thy friend and thy dogs?' ,5910,5947
82,"said Rhiannon, and he told her what had befallen Pryderi. ",5947,6005
83,"'A good friend hast thou lost,' answered Rhiannon, and she went up to the castle and through the gate, which was open. ",6005,6124
84,"There, in the centre of the courtyard, she beheld Pryderi standing, and hastened towards him. ",6124,6218
85,'What dost thou here?' ,6218,6241
86,"she asked, laying her hand on the bowl. ",6241,6281
87,"As she spoke she too stuck fast, and was not able to utter a word. ",6281,6348
88,Then thunder was heard and a veil of darkness descended upon them. ,6348,6415
89,The castle vanished and they with it. ,6415,6453
90,"When Kieva, the wife of Pryderi, found that neither her husband nor his mother returned to her, she was in such sorrow that she cared not whether she lived or died. ",6453,6618
91,"Manawyddan was grieved also in his heart, and said to her: 'It is not fitting that we should stay here. ",6618,6722
92,He have lost our dogs and cannot get food. ,6722,6765
93,Let us go into England--it is easier for us to live there.' ,6765,6825
94,So they set forth. ,6825,6844
95,'What craft wilt thou follow?' ,6844,6875
96,asked Kieva as they went along. ,6875,6907
97,"'I shall make shoes as once I did,' replied he. ",6907,6955
98,"He got all the finest leather in the town and caused gilded clasps to be made for the shoes, till everyone flocked to buy. ",6955,7078
99,All the shoemakers in the town were idle and banded together in anger to kill him. ,7078,7161
100,But luckily Manawyddan got word of it. ,7161,7200
101,He and Kieva left the town one night and proceeded to Narberth. ,7200,7264
102,"He took with him a sheaf of wheat, which he sowed in three plots of ground. ",7264,7340
103,"And while the wheat was growing up, he hunted and fished. ",7340,7398
104,They had food enough and to spare. ,7398,7433
105,Thus the months passed until the harvest. ,7433,7475
106,One evening Manawyddan visited the furthest of his fields of wheat; ,7475,7543
107, and saw that it was ripe. ,7542,7569
108,"'To-morrow I will reap this,' said he. ",7569,7608
109,On the morrow when he went to reap the wheat he found nothing but the bare straw. ,7608,7690
110,Filled with dismay he hastened to the second field. ,7690,7742
111,There the corn was ripe and golden. ,7742,7778
112,"'To-morrow I will reap this,' he said. ",7778,7817
113,"On the morrow the ears had gone, and there was nothing but the bare straw. ",7817,7892
114,"'Well, there is still one field left,' he said, and when he looked at it, it was still fairer than the other two. ",7892,8006
115,"'To-night I will watch here,' thought he. ",8006,8048
116,'Whosoever carried off the other corn will in like manner take this. ,8048,8117
117,I will know who it is.' ,8117,8141
118,So he hid himself and waited. ,8141,8171
119,"The hours slid by, and all was still, so still that Manawyddan well-nigh dropped asleep. ",8171,8260
120,"But at midnight there arose the loudest tumult in the world, and peeping out he beheld a mighty host of mice, which could neither be numbered nor measured. ",8260,8416
121,Each mouse climbed up a straw till it bent down with its weight. ,8416,8481
122,"Then it bit off one of the ears, and carried it away. ",8481,8535
123,There was not one of the straws that had not got a mouse to it. ,8535,8599
124,Full of wrath he rushed at the mice. ,8599,8636
125,"He could no more come up with them than if they had been gnats, or birds of the air, save one only which lingered behind the rest, and this mouse Manawyddan came up with. ",8636,8807
126,"Stooping down he seized it by the tail, and put it in his glove, and tied a piece of string across the opening of the glove, so that the mouse could not escape. ",8807,8968
127,"When he entered the hall where Kieva was sitting, he lighted a fire, and hung the glove up on a peg. ",8968,9069
128,'What hast thou there?' ,9069,9093
129,asked she. ,9093,9104
130,"'A thief,' he answered, 'that I caught robbing me.' ",9104,9156
131,'What kind of a thief may it be which thou couldst put in thy glove?' ,9156,9226
132,said Kieva. ,9226,9238
133,"'That I will tell thee,' he replied. ",9238,9275
134,"Then he showed her how his fields of corn had been wasted, and how he had watched for the mice. ",9275,9371
135,"'And one was less nimble than the rest, and is now in my glove. ",9371,9435
136,"To-morrow I will hang it, and I only wish I had them all.' ",9435,9494
137,"'It is a marvel, truly,' said she, 'yet it would be unseemly for a man of thy dignity to hang a reptile such as this. ",9494,9612
138,"Do not meddle with it, but let it go.' ",9612,9651
139,"'Woe betide me,' he cried, 'if I would not hang them all if I could catch them, and such as I have I will hang.' ",9651,9764
140,"'Verily,' said she, 'there is no reason I should succour this reptile, except to prevent discredit unto thee.' ",9764,9875
141,"'If I knew any cause that I should succour it, I would take thy counsel,' answered Manawyddan, 'but I know of none. ",9875,9991
142,I am minded to destroy it.' ,9991,10019
143,"'Do so then,' said Kieva. ",10019,10045
144,So he went up a hill and set up two forks on the top. ,10045,10099
145,"While he was doing this he saw a scholar coming towards him, whose clothes were tattered. ",10099,10189
146,"Now it was seven years since Manawyddan had seen man or beast in that place, and the sight amazed him. ",10189,10292
147,"'Good day to thee, my lord,' said the scholar. ",10292,10339
148,"'Good greeting to thee, scholar. ",10339,10372
149,Whence dost thou come?' ,10372,10396
150,'From singing in England; ,10396,10422
151, but wherefore dost thou ask?' ,10421,10452
152,'Because for seven years no man hath visited this place.' ,10452,10510
153,"'I wander where I will,' answered the scholar. ",10510,10557
154,'And what work art thou upon?' ,10557,10588
155,'I am about to hang a thief that I caught robbing me!' ,10588,10643
156,'What manner of thief is that?' ,10643,10675
157,inquired the scholar. ,10675,10697
158,"'I see a creature in thy hand like upon a mouse, and ill does it become a man of thy rank to touch a reptile like this. ",10697,10817
159,Let it go free.' ,10817,10834
160,"'I will not let it go free,' cried Manawyddan. ",10834,10881
161,"'I caught it robbing me, and it shall suffer the doom of a thief.' ",10881,10948
162,'Lord!' ,10948,10956
163,"said the scholar, 'sooner than see a man like thee at such a work. ",10956,11023
164,I would give thee a pound which I have received as alms to let it go free.' ,11023,11099
165,"'I will not let it go free, neither will I sell it.' ",11099,11152
166,"'As thou wilt, lord,' answered the scholar, and he went his way. ",11152,11217
167,"Manawyddan was placing the cross-beam on the two forked sticks, where the mouse was to hang, when a priest rode past. ",11217,11335
168,"'Good-day to thee, lord; ",11335,11360
169, and what art thou doing?' ,11359,11386
170,'I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me.' ,11386,11435
171,"'What manner of thief, lord?' ",11435,11465
172,'A creature in the form of a mouse. ,11465,11501
173,It has been robbing me. ,11501,11525
174,It shall suffer the doom of a thief.' ,11525,11563
175,"'Lord,' said the priest, 'sooner than see thee touch this reptile, I would purchase its freedom.' ",11563,11661
176,'I will neither sell it nor set it free.' ,11661,11703
177,'It is true that a mouse is worth nothing. ,11703,11746
178,"Rather than see thee defile thyself with touching such a reptile as this, I will give thee three pounds for it.' ",11746,11859
179,'I will not take any price for it. ,11859,11894
180,It shall be hanged as it deserves.' ,11894,11930
181,"'Willingly, my lord, if it is thy pleasure.' ",11930,11975
182,And the priest went his way. ,11975,12004
183,"Then Manawyddan noosed the string about the mouse's neck, and was about to draw it tight. ",12004,12094
184,"A bishop, with a great following and horses bearing huge packs, came by. ",12094,12167
185,'What work art thou upon?' ,12167,12194
186,"asked the bishop, drawing rein. ",12194,12226
187,'Hanging a thief that I caught robbing me.' ,12226,12270
188,'But is not that a mouse that I see in thine hand?' ,12270,12322
189,asked the bishop. ,12322,12340
190,'Yes; ,12340,12346
191," that is the thief,' answered Manawyddan. ",12345,12387
192,"'Well, since I have come at the doom of this reptile, I will ransom it of thee for seven pounds, rather than see a man of thy rank touch it. ",12387,12528
193,"Loose it, and let it go.' ",12528,12554
194,'I will not let it loose.' ,12554,12581
195,"'I will give thee four and twenty pounds to set it free,' said the bishop. ",12581,12656
196,'I will not set it free for as much again.' ,12656,12700
197,"'If thou wilt not set it free for this, I will give thee all the horses thou seest and the seven loads of baggage.' ",12700,12816
198,'I will not set it free.' ,12816,12842
199,'Then tell me at what price thou wilt loose it. ,12842,12890
200,I will give it.' ,12890,12907
201,"'The spell must be taken off Rhiannon and Pryderi,' said Manawyddan. ",12907,12976
202,'That shall be done.' ,12976,12998
203,'But not yet will I loose the mouse. ,12998,13035
204,The charm that has been cast over all my lands must be taken off likewise.' ,13035,13111
205,'This shall be done also.' ,13111,13138
206,'But not yet will I loose the mouse till I know who she is.' ,13138,13199
207,"'She is my wife,' answered the bishop. ",13199,13238
208,'And wherefore came she to me?' ,13238,13270
209,asked Manawyddan. ,286,304
210,"'To despoil thee,' replied the bishop. ",13288,13327
211,"'It is I who cast the charm over thy lands, to avenge Gwawl the son of Clud my friend. ",13327,13414
212,And it was I who threw the spell upon Pryderi to avenge Gwawl for the trick that had been played on him in the game of Badger in the Bag. ,13414,13552
213,"And not only was I wroth, but my people likewise. ",13552,13602
214,"When it was known that thou wast come to dwell in the land, they besought me much to change them into mice, that they might eat thy corn. ",13602,13740
215,The first and the second nights it was the men of my own house that destroyed thy two fields. ,13740,13834
216,On the third night my wife and her ladies came to me. ,13834,13888
217,"They begged me to change them also into the shape of mice, that they might take part in avenging Gwawl. ",13888,13992
218,Therefore I changed them. ,13992,14018
219,"Yet had she not been ill and slow of foot, thou couldst not have overtaken her. ",14018,14098
220,"Still, since she was caught, I will restore thee Pryderi and Rhiannon. ",14098,14169
221,I will take the charm from off thy lands. ,14169,14211
222,I have told thee who she is; ,14211,14240
223, so now set her free.' ,14239,14262
224,"'I will not set her free,' answered Manawyddan, 'till thou swear that no vengeance shall be taken for his, either upon Pryderi, or upon Rhiannon, or on me.' ",14262,14419
225,'I will grant thee this boon. ,14419,14449
226,Thou hast done wisely to ask it. ,14449,14482
227,On thy head would have lit all the trouble. ,14482,14526
228,Set now my wife free.' ,14526,14549
229,'I will not set her free till Pryderi and Rhiannon are with me.' ,14549,14614
230,"'Behold, here they come,' said the bishop. ",14614,14657
231,"Then Manawyddan held out his hands and greeted Pryderi and Rhiannon, and they seated themselves joyfully on the grass. ",14657,14776
232,"'Ah, lord, hast thou not received all thou didst ask?' ",14776,14831
233,said the bishop. ,12639,12656
234,'Set now my wife free!' ,14848,14872
235,"'That I will gladly,' answered Manawyddan. ",14872,14915
236,"Unloosing the cord from her neck, and as he did so the bishop struck her with his staff. ",14915,15004
237,"She turned into a young woman, the fairest that ever was seen. ",15004,15067
238,"'Look around upon thy land,' said he. ",15067,15105
239,"'Thou wilt see it all tilled and peopled, as it was long ago.' ",15105,15168
240,"And Manawyddan looked, and saw corn growing in the fields, and cows and sheep grazing on the hill-side, and huts for the people to dwell in. ",15168,15309
241,"And he was satisfied in his soul, but one more question he put to the bishop. ",15309,15387
242,'What spell didst thou lay upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?' ,15387,15442
243,'Pryderi has had the knockers of the gate of my palace hung about him. ,15442,15513
244,"Rhiannon has carried the collars of my asses around her neck,' said the bishop with a smile.",15513,15606
