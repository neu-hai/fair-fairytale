0,I WILL tell you a story that was told to me when I was a little boy. ,0,69
1,Every time I think of this story it seems to me more and more charming; ,69,141
2, for it is with stories as it is with many people--they become better as they grow older. ,140,230
3,"I have no doubt that you have been in the country and seen a very old farmhouse, with thatched roof, and mosses and small plants growing wild upon it. ",230,381
4,"There is a stork's nest on the ridge of the gable, for we cannot do without the stork. ",381,468
5,"The walls of the house are sloping, and the windows are low, and only one of the latter is made to open. ",468,573
6,The baking oven sticks out of the wall like a great knob. ,573,631
7,"An elder tree hangs over the palings, and beneath its branches, at the foot of the paling, is a pool of water in which a few ducks are sporting. ",631,776
8,"There is a yard dog, too, that barks at all comers. ",776,828
9,"Just such a farmhouse as this stood in a country lane, and in it dwelt an old couple, a peasant and his wife. ",828,938
10,"Small as their possessions were, they had one thing they could not do without, and that was a horse, which contrived to live upon the grass found by the side of the highroad. ",938,1113
11,"The old peasant rode into the town upon this horse, and his neighbors often borrowed it of him and paid for the loan of it by rendering some service to the old couple. ",1113,1281
12,Yet after a time the old people thought it would be as well to sell the horse or exchange it for something which might be more useful to them. ,1281,1424
13,But what should this _something_ be? ,1424,1461
14,"""You will know best, old man,"" said the wife. ",1461,1507
15,"""It is fair day to-day; ",1507,1531
16, so ride into town and get rid of the horse for money or make a good exchange. ,1530,1609
17,Whichever you do will please me; ,1609,1642
18," so ride to the fair."" ",1641,1664
19,"She fastened his neckerchief for him, for she could do that better than he could and she could also tie it very prettily in a double bow. ",1664,1802
20,She also smoothed his hat round and round with the palm of her hand and gave him a kiss. ,1802,1891
21,"Then he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold, or bartered for something else. ",1891,1977
22,"Yes, the goodman knew what he was about. ",1977,2018
23,"The sun shone with great heat, and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky. ",2018,2092
24,"The road was very dusty, for many people, all going to the fair, were driving, riding, or walking upon it. ",2092,2199
25,There was no shelter anywhere from the hot sun. ,2199,2247
26,"Among the crowd a man came trudging along, driving a cow to the fair. ",2247,2317
27,The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could be. ,2317,2374
28,"""She gives good milk, I am certain,"" said the peasant to himself. ",2374,2440
29,"""That would be a very good exchange: the cow for the horse. ",2440,2500
30,Halloo there! ,2500,2514
31,"you with the cow,"" he said. ",2514,2542
32,"""I tell you what, I dare say a horse is of more value than a cow; ",2542,2608
33, but I don't care for that. ,2607,2635
34,"A cow will be more useful to me, so if you like we'll exchange."" ",2635,2700
35,"""To be sure I will,"" said the man. ",2700,2735
36,Accordingly the exchange was made. ,2735,2770
37,"When the matter was settled the peasant might have turned back, for he had done the business he came to do. ",2770,2878
38,"But having made up his mind to go to the fair, he determined to do so, if only to have a look at it. ",2878,2979
39,So on he went to the town with his cow. ,2979,3019
40,"Leading the animal, he strode on sturdily, and, after a short time, overtook a man who was driving a sheep. ",3019,3127
41,"It was a good fat sheep, with a fine fleece on its back. ",3127,3184
42,"""I should like to have that fellow,"" said the peasant to himself. ",3184,3250
43,"""There is plenty of grass for him by our palings, and in the winter we could keep him in the room with us. ",3250,3357
44,Perhaps it would be more profitable to have a sheep than a cow. ,3357,3421
45,"Shall I exchange?"" ",3421,3440
46,"The man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain was quickly made. ",3440,3514
47,And then our peasant continued his way on the highroad with his sheep. ,3514,3585
48,"Soon after this, he overtook another man, who had come into the road from a field, and was carrying a large goose under his arm. ",3585,3714
49,"""What a heavy creature you have there!"" ",3714,3754
50,said the peasant. ,3754,3772
51,"""It has plenty of feathers and plenty of fat, and would look well tied to a string, or paddling in the water at our place. ",3772,3895
52,That would be very useful to my old woman; ,3895,3938
53, she could make all sorts of profit out of it. ,3937,3984
54,"How often she has said, 'If we only had a goose!' ",3984,4034
55,"Now here is an opportunity, and, if possible, I will get it for her. ",4034,4103
56,Shall we exchange? ,4103,4122
57,"I will give you my sheep for your goose, and thanks into the bargain."" ",4122,4193
58,"The other had not the least objection, and accordingly the exchange was made, and our peasant became possessor of the goose. ",4193,4318
59,By this time he had arrived very near the town. ,4318,4366
60,"The crowd on the highroad had been gradually increasing, and there was quite a rush of men and cattle. ",4366,4469
61,"The cattle walked on the path and by the palings, and at the turnpike gate they even walked into the toll keeper's potato field, where one fowl was strutting about with a string tied to its leg, lest it should take fright at the crowd and run away and get lost. ",4469,4731
62,"The tail feathers of this fowl were very short, and it winked with both its eyes, and looked very cunning as it said, ""Cluck, cluck."" ",4731,4865
63,"What were the thoughts of the fowl as it said this I cannot tell you, but as soon as our good man saw it, he thought, ""Why, that's the finest fowl I ever saw in my life; ",4865,5035
64," it's finer than our parson's brood hen, upon my word. ",5034,5089
65,I should like to have that fowl. ,5089,5122
66,"Fowls can always pick up a few grains that lie about, and almost keep themselves. ",5122,5204
67,I think it would be a good exchange if I could get it for my goose. ,5204,5272
68,"Shall we exchange?"" ",5272,5292
69,he asked the toll keeper. ,5292,5318
70,"""Exchange?"" ",5318,5330
71,repeated the man. ,5330,5348
72,"""Well, it would not be a bad thing."" ",5348,5385
73,So they made an exchange; ,5385,5411
74," the toll keeper at the turnpike gate kept the goose, and the peasant carried off the fowl. ",5410,5502
75,"Now he really had done a great deal of business on his way to the fair, and he was hot and tired. ",5502,5600
76,"He wanted something to eat, and a glass of ale to refresh himself; ",5600,5667
77, so he turned his steps to an inn. ,5666,5701
78,"He was just about to enter, when the ostler came out, and they met at the door. ",5701,5781
79,The ostler was carrying a sack. ,5781,5813
80,"""What have you in that sack?"" ",5813,5843
81,asked the peasant. ,5843,5862
82,"""Rotten apples,"" answered the ostler; ",5862,5900
83," ""a whole sackful of them. ",5899,5926
84,"They will do to feed the pigs with."" ",5926,5963
85,"""Why, that will be terrible waste,"" the peasant replied. ",5963,6020
86,"""I should like to take them home to my old woman. ",6020,6070
87,"Last year the old apple tree by the grassplot bore only one apple, and we kept it in the cupboard till it was quite withered and rotten. ",6070,6207
88,"It was property, my old woman said. ",6207,6243
89,Here she would see a great deal of property--a whole sackful. ,6243,6305
90,"I should like to show them to her."" ",6305,6341
91,"""What will you give me for the sackful?"" ",6341,6382
92,asked the ostler. ,6382,6400
93,"""What will I give? ",6400,6419
94,"Well, I will give you my fowl in exchange."" ",6419,6463
95,"So he gave up the fowl and received the apples, which he carried into the inn parlor. ",6463,6549
96,"He leaned the sack carefully against the stove, and then went to the table. ",6549,6625
97,"But the stove was hot, and he had not thought of that. ",6625,6680
98,"Many guests were present--horse-dealers, cattle-drovers, and two Englishmen. ",6680,6757
99,The Englishmen were so rich that their pockets bulged and seemed ready to burst; ,6757,6838
100," and they could bet too, as you shall hear. ",6837,6881
101,"Hiss--s--s, hiss--s--s. What could that be by the stove? ",6881,6938
102,The apples were beginning to roast. ,6938,6974
103,"""What is that?"" ",6974,6990
104,asked one. ,6990,7001
105,"""Why, do you know--"" said our peasant, and then he told them the whole story of the horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and all the rest of it, down to the apples. ",7001,7170
106,"""Well, your old woman will give it to you when you get home,"" said one of the Englishmen. ",7170,7260
107,"""Won't there be a noise?"" ",7260,7286
108,"""What! ",7286,7293
109,"Give me what?"" ",7293,7308
110,said the peasant. ,3754,3772
111,"""Why, she will kiss me, and say, 'What the goodman does is always right.'"" ",7326,7401
112,"""Let us lay a wager on it,"" said the Englishman. ",7401,7450
113,"""We'll wager you a ton of coined gold, a hundred pounds to the hundredweight."" ",7450,7529
114,"""No, a bushel will be enough,"" replied the peasant. ",7529,7581
115,"""I can only set a bushel of apples against it, and I'll throw myself and my old woman into the bargain. ",7581,7685
116,"That will pile up the measure, I fancy."" ",7685,7726
117,"""Done! ",7726,7733
118,"taken!"" ",7733,7741
119,and so the bet was made. ,7741,7766
120,"Then the landlord's coach came to the door, and the two Englishmen and the peasant got in, and away they drove. ",7766,7878
121,Soon they had stopped at the peasant's hut. ,7878,7922
122,"""Good evening, old woman."" ",7922,7949
123,"""Good evening, old man."" ",7949,7974
124,"""I've made the exchange."" ",7974,8000
125,"""Ah, well, you understand what you're about,"" said the woman. ",8000,8062
126,"Then she embraced him, and paid no attention to the strangers, nor did she notice the sack. ",8062,8154
127,"""I got a cow in exchange for the horse."" ",8154,8195
128,"""Oh, how delightful!"" ",8195,8217
129,said she. ,8217,8227
130,"""Now we shall have plenty of milk, and butter, and cheese on the table. ",8227,8299
131,"That was a capital exchange."" ",8299,8329
132,"""Yes, but I changed the cow for a sheep."" ",8329,8371
133,"""Ah, better still!"" ",8371,8391
134,cried the wife. ,8391,8407
135,"""You always think of everything; ",8407,8440
136, we have just enough pasture for a sheep. ,8439,8481
137,"Ewe's milk and cheese, woolen jackets and stockings! ",8481,8534
138,"The cow could not give all these, and her hairs only fall off. ",8534,8597
139,"How you think of everything!"" ",8597,8627
140,"""But I changed away the sheep for a goose."" ",8627,8671
141,"""Then we shall have roast goose to eat this year. ",8671,8721
142,"You dear old man, you are always thinking of something to please me. ",8721,8790
143,This is delightful. ,8790,8810
144,"We can let the goose walk about with a string tied to her leg, so that she will get fatter still before we roast her."" ",8810,8929
145,"""But I gave away the goose for a fowl."" ",8929,8969
146,"""A fowl! ",8969,8978
147,"Well, that was a good exchange,"" replied the woman. ",8978,9030
148,"""The fowl will lay eggs and hatch them, and we shall have chickens. ",9030,9098
149,We shall soon have a poultry yard. ,9098,9133
150,"Oh, this is just what I was wishing for!"" ",9133,9175
151,"""Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shriveled apples."" ",9175,9239
152,"""What! ",7286,7293
153,"I must really give you a kiss for that!"" ",9246,9287
154,exclaimed the wife. ,9287,9307
155,"""My dear, good husband, now I'll tell you something. ",9307,9360
156,"Do you know, almost as soon as you left me this morning, I began thinking of what I could give you nice for supper this evening, and then I thought of fried eggs and bacon, with sweet herbs. ",9360,9551
157,"I had eggs and bacon but lacked the herbs, so I went over to the schoolmaster's. ",9551,9632
158,"I knew they had plenty of herbs, but the schoolmistress is very mean, although she can smile so sweetly. ",9632,9737
159,I begged her to lend me a handful of herbs. ,9737,9781
160,'Lend!' ,9781,9789
161,"she exclaimed, 'I have nothing to lend. ",9789,9829
162,"I could not even lend you a shriveled apple, my dear woman.' ",9829,9890
163,"But now I can lend her ten, or a whole sackful, for which I'm very glad. ",9890,9963
164,"It makes me laugh to think of it."" ",9963,9998
165,Then she gave him a hearty kiss. ,9998,10031
166,"""Well, I like all this,"" said both the Englishmen; ",10031,10082
167," ""always going down the hill and yet always merry. ",10081,10132
168,"It's worth the money to see it."" ",10132,10165
169,"So they paid a hundredweight of gold to the peasant who, whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed. ",10165,10267
170,"Yes, it always pays best when the wife sees and maintains that her husband knows best and that whatever he does is right. ",10267,10389
171,This is a story which I heard when I was a child. ,10389,10439
172,"And now you have heard it, too, and know that ""What the goodman does is always right.""",10439,10526
