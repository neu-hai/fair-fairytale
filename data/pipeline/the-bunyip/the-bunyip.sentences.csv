0,"Long, long ago, far, far away on the other side of the world, some young men left the camp where they lived to get some food for their wives and children. ",0,155
1,"The sun was hot, but they liked heat, and as they went they ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest, or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang, which always returns to the thrower. ",155,377
2,"They did not get on very fast at this rate, but presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of water, but was now, in the height of summer, only a set of pools, each surrounded with a fringe of plants, with bulrushes standing in the inside of all. ",377,648
3,"In that country the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes, which they think as good as onions, and one of the young men said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp. ",648,857
4,"It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket, and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out: 'After all, why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children? ",857,1139
5,Let them come and get the roots for themselves; ,1139,1187
6, but we will fish for eels and anything else we can get.' ,1186,1244
7,"This delighted the rest of the party, and they all began to arrange their fishing lines, made from the bark of the yellow mimosa, and to search for bait for their hooks. ",1244,1414
8,"Most of them used worms, but one, who had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet, cut off a little bit and baited his line with it, unseen by his companions. ",1414,1589
9,"For a long time they cast patiently, without receiving a single bite; ",1589,1659
10," the sun had grown low in the sky, and it seemed as if they would have to go home empty-handed, not even with a basket of roots to show; ",1658,1795
11," when the youth, who had baited his hook with raw meat, suddenly saw his line disappear under the water. ",1794,1899
12,"Something, a very heavy fish he supposed, was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet, and for a few minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool. ",1899,2086
13,"He cried to his friends to help him, and at last, trembling with fright at what they were going to see, they managed between them to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal, but something of both, with a long, broad tail. ",2086,2331
14,"They looked at each other with horror, cold shivers running down their spines; ",2331,2410
15," for though they had never beheld it, there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was--the cub of the awful Bunyip! ",2409,2539
16,"All of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail, answered by another from the other side of the pool, as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them, rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes. ",2539,2749
17,'Let it go! ,2749,2761
18,let it go!' ,2761,2773
19,whispered the young men to each other; ,2773,2812
20," but the captor declared that he had caught it, and was going to keep it. ",2811,2885
21,"'He had promised his sweetheart,' he said, 'that he would bring back enough meat for her father's house to feast on for three days, and though they could not eat the little Bunyip, her brothers and sisters should have it to play with.' ",2885,3121
22,"So, flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back, he threw the little Bunyip on to his shoulders, and set out for the camp, never heeding the poor mother's cries of distress. ",3121,3301
23,"By this time it was getting near sunset, and the plain was in shadow, though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright. ",3301,3429
24,"The youths had all ceased to be afraid, when they were startled by a low rushing sound behind them, and, looking round, saw that the pool was slowly rising, and the spot where they had landed the Bunyip was quite covered. ",3429,3651
25,'What could it be?' ,3651,3671
26,they asked one of another; ,3671,3698
27," 'there was not a cloud in the sky, yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it do before.' ",3697,3812
28,"For an instant they stood watching as if they were frozen, then they turned and ran with all their might, the man with the Bunyip running faster than all. ",3812,3967
29,"When he reached a high peak over-looking all the plain he stopped to take breath, and turned to see if he was safe yet. ",3967,4087
30,Safe! ,4087,4093
31,"why only the tops of the trees remained above that sea of water, and these were fast disappearing. ",4093,4192
32,They must run fast indeed if they were to escape. ,4192,4242
33,"So on they flew, scarcely feeling the ground as they went, till they flung themselves on the ground before the holes scooped out of the earth where they had all been born. ",4242,4414
34,"The old men were sitting in front, the children were playing, and the women chattering together, when the little Bunyip fell into their midst, and there was scarcely a child among them who did not know that something terrible was upon them. ",4414,4655
35,'The water! ,4655,4667
36,the water!' ,4667,4679
37,gasped one of the young men; ,4679,4708
38," and there it was, slowly but steadily mounting the ridge itself. ",4707,4773
39,"Parents and children clung together, as if by that means they could drive back the advancing flood; ",4773,4873
40," and the youth who had caused all this terrible catastrophe, seized his sweetheart, and cried: 'I will climb with you to the top of that tree, and there no waters can reach us.' ",4872,5050
41,"But, as he spoke, something cold touched him, and quickly he glanced down at his feet. ",5050,5137
42,"Then with a shudder he saw that they were feet no longer, but bird's claws. ",5137,5213
43,"He looked at the girl he was clasping, and beheld a great black bird standing at his side; ",5213,5304
44," he turned to his friends, but a flock of great awkward flapping creatures stood in their place He put up his hands to cover his face, but they were no more hands, only the ends of wings; ",5303,5491
45," and when he tried to speak, a noise such as he had never heard before seemed to come from his throat, which had suddenly become narrow and slender. ",5490,5639
46,"Already the water had risen to his waist, and he found himself sitting easily upon it, while its surface reflected back the image of a black swan, one of many. ",5639,5799
47,Never again did the swans become men; ,5799,5837
48," but they are still different from other swans, for in the night-time those who listen can hear them talk in a language that is certainly not swan's language; ",5836,5995
49," and there are even sounds of laughing and talking, unlike any noise made by the swans whom we know. ",5994,6095
50,"The little Bunyip was carried home by its mother, and after that the waters sank back to their own channels. ",6095,6204
51,"The side of the pool where she lives is always shunned by everyone, as nobody knows when she may suddenly put out her head and draw him into her mighty jaws. ",6204,6362
52,"But people say that underneath the black waters of the pool she has a house filled with beautiful things, such as mortals who dwell on the earth have no idea of. ",6362,6524
53,"Though how they know I cannot tell you, as nobody has ever seen it.",6524,6592
