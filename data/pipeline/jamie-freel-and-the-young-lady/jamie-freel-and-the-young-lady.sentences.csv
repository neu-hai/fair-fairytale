0,"Down in Fannet, in times gone by, lived Jamie Freel and his mother. ",0,68
1,Jamie was the widow's sole support. ,68,104
2,"His strong arm worked for her untiringly, and as each Saturday night came round he poured his wages into her lap, thanking her dutifully for the halfpence which she returned him for tobacco. ",104,295
3,He was extolled by his neighbours as the best son ever known or heard of. ,295,369
4,But he had neighbours of whose opinions he was ignorant. ,369,426
5,"Neighbours who lived pretty close to him, whom he had never seen, who are, indeed, rarely seen by mortals, except on May Eves or Halloweens. ",426,567
6,"An old ruined castle, about a quarter of a mile from his cabin, was said to be the abode of the ""wee folk."" ",567,675
7,"Every Halloween were the ancient windows lighted up, and passersby saw little figures flitting to and fro inside the building, while they heard the music of flutes and pipes. ",675,850
8,It was well known that fairy revels took place. ,850,898
9,Nobody had the courage to intrude on them. ,898,941
10,"Jamie had often watched the little figures from a distance, and listened to the charming music, wondering what the inside of the castle was like. ",941,1087
11,"One Halloween he got up, and took his cap, saying to his mother, ""I'm awa to the castle to seek my fortune."" ",1087,1196
12,"""What!"" ",1196,1204
13,cried she. ,1204,1215
14,"""Would you venture there--you that's the widow's only son? ",1215,1274
15,"Dinna be so venturesome and foolitch, Jamie! ",1274,1319

17,"""Never fear, mother; ",1367,1388
18," no harm'll happen me, but I maun gae."" ",1387,1427
19,"He set out, and, as he crossed the potato field, came in sight of the castle, whose windows were ablaze with light that seemed to turn the russet leaves, still clinging to the crab-tree branches, into gold. ",1427,1634
20,"Halting in the grove at one side of the ruin, he listened to the elfin revelry. ",1634,1714
21,The laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed. ,1714,1784
22,"Numbers of little people, the largest about the size of a child of five years old, were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles, while others drank and feasted. ",1784,1948
23,"""Welcome, Jamie Freel! ",1948,1971
24,"Welcome, welcome, Jamie!"" ",1971,1997
25,"cried the company, perceiving their visitor. ",1997,2042
26,"The word ""Welcome"" was caught up and repeated by every voice in the castle. ",2042,2118
27,"Time flew, and Jamie was enjoying himself very much, when his hosts said, ""We're going to ride to Dublin to-night to steal a young lady. ",2118,2255
28,"Will you come, too, Jamie Freel?"" ",2255,2289
29,"""Ay, that I will,"" cried the rash youth, thirsting for adventure. ",2289,2355
30,A troop of horses stood at the door. ,2355,2392
31,"Jamie mounted, and his steed rose with him into the air. ",2392,2449
32,"He was presently flying over his mother's cottage, surrounded by the elfin troop. ",2449,2531
33,"On and on they went, over bold mountains, over little hills, over the deep Lough Swilley, over towns and cottages, where people were burning nuts and eating apples and keeping merry Halloween. ",2531,2724
34,It seemed to Jamie that they flew all round Ireland before they got to Dublin. ,2724,2803
35,"""This is Derry,"" said the fairies, flying over the cathedral spire. ",2803,2871
36,"What was said by one voice was repeated by all the rest, till fifty little voices were crying out, ""Derry! ",2871,2978
37,Derry! ,2971,2978
38,"Derry!"" ",2985,2993
39,"In like manner was Jamie informed as they passed over each town on the route, and at length he heard the silvery voices cry, ""Dublin! ",2993,3127
40,"Dublin!"" ",3127,3136
41,"It was no mean dwelling that was to be honoured by the fairy visit, but one of the finest houses in Stephen's Green. ",3136,3253
42,"The troop dismounted near a window, and Jamie saw a beautiful face on a pillow in a splendid bed. ",3253,3351
43,"He saw the young lady lifted and carried away, while the stick which was dropped in her place on the bed took her exact form. ",3351,3477
44,"The lady was placed before one rider and carried a short way, then given another, and the names of the towns were cried as before. ",3477,3608
45,They were approaching home. ,3608,3636
46,"Jamie heard ""Rathmullan,"" ""Milford,"" ""Tamney,"" and then he knew they were near his own house. ",3636,3730
47,"""You've all had your turn at carrying the young lady,"" said he. ",3730,3794
48,"""Why wouldn't I get her for a wee piece?"" ",3794,3836
49,"""Ay, Jamie,"" replied they pleasantly, ""you may take your turn at carrying her, to be sure."" ",3836,3928
50,Holding his prize very tightly he dropped down near his mother's door. ,3928,3999
51,"""Jamie Freel! ",3999,4013
52,Jamie Freel! ,1958,1971
53,"is that the way you treat us?"" ",4026,4057
54,"cried they, and they, too, dropped down near the door. ",4057,4112
55,"Jamie held fast, though he knew not what he was holding, for the little folk turned the lady into all sorts of strange shapes. ",4112,4239
56,"At one moment she was a black dog, barking and trying to bite. ",4239,4302
57,"At another a glowing bar of iron, which yet had no heat; ",4302,4359
58, then again a sack of wool. ,4358,4386
59,"But still Jamie held her, and the baffled elves were turning away when a tiny woman, the smallest of the party, exclaimed, ""Jamie Freel has her awa frae us, but he sall nae hae gude of her, for I'll make her deaf and dumb,"" and she threw something over the young girl. ",4386,4655
60,"While they rode off, disappointed, Jamie Freel lifted the latch and went in. ",4655,4732
61,"""Jamie man!"" ",4732,4745
62,"cried his mother, ""you've been away all night. ",4745,4792
63,"What have they done on you?"" ",4792,4821
64,"""Naething bad, mother. ",4821,4844
65,I have the very best of gude luck. ,4844,4879
66,"Here's a beautiful young lady I hae brought you for company."" ",4879,4941
67,"""Bless us and save us!"" ",4941,4965
68,exclaimed his mother. ,4965,4987
69,For some minutes she was so astonished she could not think of anything else to say. ,4987,5071
70,"Jamie told the story of the night's adventure, ending by saying, ""Surely you wouldna have allowed me to let her gang with them to be lost for ever?"" ",5071,5220
71,"""But a lady, Jamie! ",5220,5240
72,How can a lady eat we'er (our) poor diet and live in we'er poor way? ,5240,5309
73,"I ax you that, you foolitch fellow!"" ",5309,5346
74,"""Well, mother, sure it's better for her to be over here nor yonder,"" and he pointed in the direction of the castle. ",5346,5462
75,"Meanwhile the deaf and dumb girl shivered in her light clothing, stepping close to the humble turf fire. ",5462,5567
76,"""Poor crathur, she's quare and handsome! ",5567,5608
77,"Nae wonder they set their hearts on her,"" said the old woman, gazing at their guest with pity and admiration. ",5608,5718
78,"""We maun dress her first. ",5718,5744
79,"What in the name of fortune have I fit for the likes of her to wear?"" ",5744,5814
80,"She went to her press in ""the room"" and took out her Sunday gown of brown drugget. ",5814,5897
81,"She then opened a drawer and drew forth a pair of white stockings, a long snowy garment of fine linen, and a cap, her ""dead dress,"" as she called it. ",5897,6047
82,"These articles of attire had long been ready for a certain triste ceremony, in which she would some day fill the chief part, and only saw the light occasionally when they were hung out to air. ",6047,6240
83,"She was willing to give even these to the fair trembling visitor, who was turning in dumb sorrow and wonder from her to Jamie, and from Jamie back to her. ",6240,6395
84,"The poor girl suffered herself to be dressed, and then sat down on a ""creepie"" in the chimney corner and buried her face in her hands. ",6395,6530
85,"""What'll we do to keep up a lady like you?"" ",6530,6574
86,cried the old woman. ,6574,6595
87,"""I'll work for you both, mother,"" replied the son. ",6595,6646
88,"""An' how could a lady live on we'er poor diet?"" ",6646,6694
89,she repeated. ,6694,6708
90,"""I'll work for her,"" was all Jamie's answer. ",6708,6753
91,He kept his word. ,6753,6771
92,"The young lady was very sad for a long time, and tears stole down her cheeks many an evening, while the old woman span by the fire and Jamie made salmon nets, an accomplishment acquired by him in hopes of adding to the comfort of their guest. ",6771,7014
93,"But she was always gentle, and tried to smile when she perceived them looking at her. ",7014,7100
94,By degrees she adapted herself to their ways and mode of life. ,7100,7163
95,"It was not very long before she began to feed the pig, mash potatoes and meal for the fowls, and knit blue worsted socks. ",7163,7285
96,So a year passed and Halloween came round again. ,7285,7334
97,"""Mother,"" said Jamie, taking down his cap, ""I'm off to the old castle to seek my fortune."" ",7334,7425
98,"""Are you mad, Jamie?"" ",7425,7447
99,cried his mother in terror. ,7447,7475
100,"""Sure they'll kill you this time for what you done on them last year."" ",7475,7546
101,Jamie made light of her fears and went his way. ,7546,7594
102,"As he reached the crab-tree grove he saw bright lights in the castle windows as before, and heard loud talking. ",7594,7706
103,"Creeping under the window he heard the wee folk say, ""That was a poor trick Jamie Freel played us this night last year, when he stole the young lady from us."" ",7706,7865
104,"""Ay,"" said the tiny woman, ""an' I punished him for it, for there she sits a dumb image by the hearth, but he does not know that three drops out of this glass that I hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and speech back again."" ",7865,8094
105,Jamie's heart beat fast as he entered the hall. ,8094,8142
106,"Again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company--""Here comes Jamie Freel! ",8142,8230
107,"Welcome, welcome, Jamie!"" ",1971,1997
108,"As soon as the tumult subsided the little woman said, ""You be to drink our health, Jamie, out of this glass in my hand."" ",8256,8377
109,Jamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door. ,8377,8435
110,"He never knew how he reached his cabin, but he arrived there breathless and sank on a stove by the fire. ",8435,8540
111,"""You're kilt, surely, this time, my poor boy,"" said his mother. ",8540,8604
112,"""No, indeed, better luck than ever this time!"" ",8604,8651
113,"and he gave the lady three drops of the liquid that still remained at the bottom of the glass, notwithstanding his mad race over the potato field. ",8651,8798
114,"The lady began to speak, and her first words were words of thanks to Jamie. ",8798,8874
115,"The three inmates of the cabin had so much to say to one another that, long after cock-crow, when the fairy music had quite ceased, they were talking round the fire. ",8874,9040
116,"""Jamie,"" said the lady, ""be pleased to get me paper and pen and ink that I may write to my father and tell him what has become of me."" ",9040,9175
117,"She wrote, but weeks passed and she received no answer. ",9175,9231
118,"Again and again she wrote, and still no answer. ",9231,9279
119,"At length she said, ""You must come with me to Dublin, Jamie, to find my father."" ",9279,9360
120,"""I have no money to hire a car for you,"" he answered. ",9360,9414
121,"""And how can you travel to Dublin on your foot?"" ",9414,9463
122,But she implored him so much that he consented to set out with her and walk all the way from Fannet to Dublin. ,9463,9574
123,It was not as easy as the fairy journey. ,9574,9615
124,But at last they rang the bell at the door of the house in Stephen's Green. ,9615,9691
125,"""Tell my father that his daughter is here,"" said she to the servant who opened the door. ",9691,9780
126,"""The gentleman that lives here has no daughter, my girl. ",9780,9837
127,"He had one, but she died better nor a year ago."" ",9837,9886
128,"""Do you not know me, Sullivan?"" ",9886,9918
129,"""No, poor girl, I do not."" ",9918,9945
130,"""Let me see the gentleman. ",9945,9972
131,"I only ask to see him."" ",9972,9996
132,"""Well, that's not much to ax. ",9996,10026
133,"We'll see what can be done."" ",10026,10055
134,In a few moments the lady's father came to the door. ,10055,10108
135,"""How dare you call me your father?"" ",10108,10144
136,cried the old gentleman angrily. ,10144,10177
137,"""You are an impostor. ",10177,10199
138,"I have no daughter."" ",10199,10220
139,"""Look in my face, father, and surely you'll remember me."" ",10220,10278
140,"""My daughter is dead and buried. ",10278,10311
141,"She died a long, long time ago."" ",10311,10344
142,The old gentleman's voice changed from anger to sorrow. ,10344,10400
143,"""You can go,"" he concluded. ",10400,10428
144,"""Stop, dear father, till you look at this ring on my finger. ",10428,10489
145,"Look at your name and mine engraved on it."" ",10489,10533
146,"""It certainly is my daughter's ring, but I do not know how you came by it. ",10533,10608
147,"I fear in no honest way."" ",10608,10634
148,"""Call my mother--she will be sure to know me,"" said the poor girl, who by this time was weeping bitterly. ",10634,10740
149,"""My poor wife is beginning to forget her sorrow. ",10740,10789
150,She seldom speaks of her daughter now. ,10789,10828
151,"Why should I renew her grief by reminding her of her loss?"" ",10828,10888
152,But the young lady persevered till at last the mother was sent for. ,10888,10956
153,"""Mother,"" she began, when the old lady came to the door, ""don't you know your daughter?"" ",10956,11045
154,"""I have no daughter. ",11045,11066
155,"My daughter died, and was buried a long, long time ago."" ",11066,11123
156,"""Only look in my face and surely you'll know me."" ",11123,11173
157,The old lady shook her head. ,11173,11202
158,"""You have all forgotten me. ",11202,11230
159,But look at this mole on my neck. ,11230,11264
160,"Surely, mother, you know me now?"" ",11264,11298
161,"""Yes, yes,"" said her mother, ""my Gracie had a mole on her neck like that. ",11298,11372
162,"But then I saw her in the coffin, and saw the lid shut down upon her."" ",11372,11443
163,"It became Jamie's turn to speak, and he gave the history of the fairy journey, of the theft of the young lady, of the figure he had seen laid in its place, of her life with his mother in Fannet, of last Halloween, and of the three drops that had released her from her enchantments. ",11443,11725
164,She took up the story when he paused and told how kind the mother and son had been to her. ,11725,11816
165,The parents could not make enough of Jamie. ,11816,11860
166,"They treated him with every distinction, and when he expressed his wish to return to Fannet, said they did not know what to do to express their gratitude. ",11860,12015
167,But an awkward complication arose. ,12015,12050
168,The daughter would not let him go without her. ,12050,12097
169,"""If Jamie goes, I'll go, too,"" she said. ",12097,12138
170,"""He saved me from the fairies, and has worked for me ever since. ",12138,12203

172,"If he goes, I'll go, too."" ",12291,12318
173,"This being her resolution, the old gentleman said that Jamie should become his son-in-law. ",12318,12409
174,"The mother was brought from Fannet in a coach-and-four, and there was a splendid wedding. ",12409,12499
