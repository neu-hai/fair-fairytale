0,"In the days when Murtough Mac Erca was in the High Kingship of Ireland, the country was divided between the old beliefs of paganism and the new doctrines of the Christian teaching. ",0,181
1,"Part held with the old creed and part with the new, and the thought of the people was troubled between them, for they knew not which way to follow and which to forsake. ",181,350
2,"The faith of their forefathers clung close around them, holding them by many fine and tender threads of memory and custom and tradition; ",350,487
3," yet still the new faith was making its way, and every day it spread wider and wider through the land. ",486,589
4,"The family of Murtough had joined itself to the Christian faith, and his three brothers were bishops and abbots of the Church, but Murtough himself remained a pagan, for he was a wild and lawless prince, and the peaceful teachings of the Christian doctrine, with its forgiveness of enemies, pleased him not at all. ",589,904
5,"Fierce and cruel was his life, filled with dark deeds and bloody wars, and savage and tragic was his death, as we shall hear. ",904,1030
6,"Now Murtough was in the sunny summer palace of Cletty, which Cormac, son of Art, had built for a pleasure house on the brink of the slow-flowing Boyne, near the Fairy Brugh of Angus the Ever Young, the God of Youth and Beauty. ",1030,1257
7,"A day of summer was that day, and the King came forth to hunt on the borders of the Brugh, with all his boon companions around him. ",1257,1389
8,"But when the high-noon came the sun grew hot, and the King sat down to rest upon the fairy mound, and the hunt passed on beyond him, and he was left alone. ",1389,1545
9,"There was a witch woman in that country whose name was ""Sigh, Sough, Storm, Rough Wind, Winter Night, Cry, Wail, and Groan."" ",1545,1670
10,"Star-bright and beautiful was she in face and form, but inwardly she was cruel as her names. ",1670,1763
11,"And she hated Murtough because he had scattered and destroyed the Ancient Peoples of the Fairy Tribes of Erin, her country and her fatherland, and because in the battle which he fought at Cerb on the Boyne her father and her mother and her sister had been slain. ",1763,2026
12,For in those days women went to battle side by side with men. ,2026,2088
13,"She knew, too, that with the coming of the new faith trouble would come upon the fairy folk, and their power and their great majesty would depart from them, and men would call them demons, and would drive them out with psalm-singing and with the saying of prayers, and with the sound of little tinkling bells. ",2088,2398
14,"So trouble and anger wrought in the witch woman, and she waited the day to be revenged on Murtough, for he being yet a pagan, was still within her power to harm. ",2398,2560
15,"So when Sheen (for Sheen or ""Storm"" was the name men gave to her) saw the King seated on the fairy mound and all his comrades parted from him, she arose softly, and combed her hair with her comb of silver adorned with little ribs of gold, and she washed her hands in a silver basin wherein were four golden birds sitting on the rim of the bowl, and little bright gems of carbuncle set round about the rim. ",2560,2966
16,"And she donned her fairy mantle of flowing green, and her cloak, wide and hooded, with silvery fringes, and a brooch of fairest gold. ",2966,3100
17,"On her head were tresses yellow like to gold, plaited in four locks, with a golden drop at the end of each long tress. ",3100,3219
18,The hue of her hair was like the flower of the iris in summer or like red gold after the burnishing thereof. ,3219,3328
19,"And she wore on her breasts and at her shoulders marvellous clasps of gold, finely worked with the tracery of the skilled craftsman, and a golden twisted torque around her throat. ",3328,3508
20,And when she was decked she went softly and sat down beside Murtough on the turfy hunting mound. ,3508,3605
21,"And after a space Murtough perceived her sitting there, and the sun shining upon her, so that the glittering of the gold and of her golden hair and the bright shining of the green silk of her garments, was like the yellow iris-beds upon the lake on a sunny summer's day. ",3605,3876
22,"Wonder and terror seized on Murtough at her beauty, and he knew not if he loved her or if he hated her the most; ",3876,3989
23," for at one moment all his nature was filled with longing and with love of her, so that it seemed to him that he would give the whole of Ireland for the loan of one hour's space of dalliance with her; ",3988,4189
24," but after that he felt a dread of her, because he knew his fate was in her hands, and that she had come to work him ill. ",4188,4310
25,But he welcomed her as if she were known to him and he asked her wherefore she was come. ,4310,4399
26,"""I am come,"" she said, ""because I am beloved of Murtough, son of Erc, King of Erin, and I come to seek him here."" ",4399,4513
27,"Then Murtough was glad, and he said, ""Dost thou not know me, maiden?"" ",4513,4583
28,"""I do,"" she answered, ""for all secret and mysterious things are known to me and thou and all the men of Erin are well known."" ",4583,4709
29,"After he had conversed with her awhile, she appeared to him so fair that the King was ready to promise her anything in life she wished, so long as she would go with him to Cletty of the Boyne. ",4709,4902
30,"""My wish,"" she said, ""is that you take me to your house, and that you put out from it your wife and your children because they are of the new faith, and all the clerics that are in your house, and that neither your wife nor any cleric be permitted to enter the house while I am there."" ",4902,5188
31,"""I will give you,"" said the King, ""a hundred head of every herd of cattle that is within my kingdom, and a hundred drinking horns, and a hundred cups, and a hundred rings of gold, and a feast every other night in the summer palace of Cletty. ",5188,5430
32,"But I pledge thee my word, oh, maiden, it were easier for me to give thee half of Ireland than to do this thing that thou hast asked."" ",5430,5565
33,"For Murtough feared that when those that were of the Christian faith were put out of his house, she would work her spells upon him, and no power would be left with him to resist those spells. ",5565,5757
34,"""I will not take thy gifts,"" said the damsel, ""but only those things that I have asked; ",5757,5845
35," moreover, it is thus, that my name must never be uttered by thee, nor must any man or woman learn it."" ",5844,5948
36,"""What is thy name,"" said Murtough, ""that it may not come upon my lips to utter it?"" ",5948,6032
37,"And she said, ""Sigh, Sough, Storm, Rough Wind, Winter Night, Cry, Wail, Groan, this is my name, but men call me Sheen, for 'Storm' or Sheen is my chief name, and storms are with me where I come."" ",6032,6228
38,"Nevertheless, Murtough was so fascinated by her that he brought her to his home, and drove out the clerics that were there, with his wife and children along with them, and drove out also the nobles of his own clan, the children of Niall, two great and gallant battalions. ",6228,6500
39,"And Duivsech, his wife, went crying along the road with her children around her to seek Bishop Cairnech, the half-brother of her husband, and her own soul-friend, that she might obtain help and shelter from him. ",6500,6712
40,"But Sheen went gladly and light-heartedly into the House of Cletty, and when she saw the lovely lightsome house and the goodly nobles of the clan of Niall, and the feasting and banqueting and the playing of the minstrels and all the joyous noise of that kingly dwelling, her heart was lifted within her, and ""Fair as a fairy palace is this house of Cletty,"" said she. ",6712,7080
41,"""Fair, indeed, it is,"" replied the King; ",7080,7121
42," ""for neither the Kings of Leinster nor the Kings of mighty Ulster, nor the lords of the clans of Owen or of Niall, have such a house as this; ",7120,7263
43," nay, in Tara of the Kings itself, no house to equal this house of mine is found."" ",7262,7345
44,"And that night the King robed himself in all the splendour of his royal dignity, and on his right hand he seated Sheen, and a great banquet was made before them, and men said that never on earth was to be seen a woman more goodly of appearance than she. ",7345,7599
45,"And the King was astonished at her, and he began to ask her questions, for it seemed to him that the power of a great goddess of the ancient time was in her; ",7599,7757
46," and he asked her whence she came, and what manner was the power that he saw in her. ",7756,7841
47,"He asked her, too, did she believe in the God of the clerics, or was she herself some goddess of the older world? ",7841,7955
48,"For he feared her, feeling that his fate was in her hands. ",7955,8014
49,"She laughed a careless and a cruel laugh, for she knew that the King was in their power, now that she was there alone with him, and the clerics and the Christian teachers gone. ",8014,8191
50,"""Fear me not, O Murtough,"" she cried; ",8191,8229
51," ""I am, like thee, a daughter of the race of men of the ancient family of Adam and of Eve; ",8228,8319
52, fit and meet my comradeship with thee; ,8318,8358
53," therefore, fear not nor regret. ",8357,8390
54,"And as to that true God of thine, worker of miracles and helper of His people, no miracle in all the world is there that I, by mine own unaided power, cannot work the like. ",8390,8563
55,I can create a sun and moon; ,8563,8592
56, the heavens I can sprinkle with radiant stars of night. ,8591,8648
57,"I can call up to life men fiercely fighting in conflict, slaughtering one another. ",8648,8731
58,"Wine I could make of the cold water of the Boyne, and sheep of lifeless stones, and swine of ferns. ",8731,8831
59,"In the presence of the hosts I can make gold and silver, plenty and to spare; ",8831,8909
60, and hosts of famous fighting men I can produce from naught. ,8908,8969
61,"Now, tell me, can thy God work the like?"" ",8969,9011
62,"""Work for us,"" says the King, ""some of these great wonders."" ",9011,9072
63,"Then Sheen went forth out of the house, and she set herself to work spells on Murtough, so that he knew not whether he was in his right mind or no. ",9072,9220
64,"She took of the water of the Boyne and made a magic wine thereout, and she took ferns and spiked thistles and light puff-balls of the woods, and out of them she fashioned magic swine and sheep and goats, and with these she fed Murtough and the hosts. ",9220,9471
65,"And when they had eaten, all their strength went from them, and the magic wine sent them into an uneasy sleep and restless slumbers. ",9471,9604
66,"And out of stones and sods of earth she fashioned three battalions, and one of the battalions she placed at one side of the house, and the other at the further side beyond it, and one encircling the rest southward along the hollow windings of the glen. ",9604,9857
67,"And thus were these battalions, one of them all made of men stark-naked and their colour blue, and the second with heads of goats with shaggy beards and horned; ",9857,10018
68," but the third, more terrible than they, for these were headless men, fighting like human beings, yet finished at the neck; ",10017,10141
69," and the sound of heavy shouting as of hosts and multitudes came from the first and the second battalion, but from the third no sound save only that they waved their arms and struck their weapons together, and smote the ground with their feet impatiently. ",10140,10396
70,"And though terrible was the shout of the blue men and the bleating of the goats with human limbs, more horrible yet was the stamping and the rage of those headless men, finished at the neck. ",10396,10587
71,"And Murtough, in his sleep and in his dreams, heard the battle-shout, and he rose impetuously from off his bed, but the wine overcame him, and his strength departed from him, and he fell helplessly upon the floor. ",10587,10801
72,"Then he heard the challenge a second time, and the stamping of the feet without, and he rose again, and madly, fiercely, he set on them, charging the hosts and scattering them before him, as he thought, as far as the fairy palace of the Brugh. ",10801,11045
73,"But all his strength was lost in fighting phantoms, for they were but stones and sods and withered leaves of the forest that he took for fighting men. ",11045,11196
74,"Now Duivsech, Murtough's wife, knew what was going on. ",11196,11251
75,"She called upon Cairnech to arise and to gather together the clans of the children of his people, the men of Owen and of Niall, and together they went to the fort; ",11251,11415
76," but Sheen guarded it well, so that they could by no means find an entrance. ",11414,11491
77,"Then Cairnech was angry, and he cursed the place, and he dug a grave before the door, and he stood up upon the mound of the grave, and rang his bells and cursed the King and his house, and prophesied his downfall. ",11491,11705
78,"But he blessed the clans of Owen and of Niall, and they returned to their own country. ",11705,11792
79,"Then Cairnech sent messengers to seek Murtough and to draw him away from the witch woman who sought his destruction, but because she was so lovely the King would believe no evil of her; ",11792,11978
80," and whenever he made any sign to go to Cairnech, she threw her spell upon the King, so that he could not break away. ",11977,12095
81,"When he was so weak and faint that he had no power left, she cast a sleep upon him, and she went round the house, putting everything in readiness. ",12095,12242
82,"She called upon her magic host of warriors, and set them round the fortress, with their spears and javelins pointed inwards towards the house, so that the King would not dare to go out amongst them. ",12242,12441
83,"And that night was a night of Samhain-tide, the eve of Wednesday after All Souls' Day. ",12441,12528
84,"Then she went everywhere throughout the house, and took lighted brands and burning torches, and scattered them in every part of the dwelling. ",12528,12670
85,"And she returned into the room wherein Murtough slept, and lay down by his side. ",12670,12751
86,"And she caused a great wind to spring up, and it came soughing through the house from the north-west; ",12751,12853
87," and the King said, ""This is the sigh of the winter night."" ",12852,12912
88,"And Sheen smiled, because, unwittingly, the King had spoken her name, for she knew by that that the hour of her revenge had come. ",12912,13042
89,"""It is I myself that am Sigh and Winter Night,"" she said, ""and I am Rough Wind and Storm, a daughter of fair nobles; ",13042,13159
90," and I am Cry and Wail, the maid of elfin birth, who brings ill-luck to men."" ",13158,13236
91,After that she caused a great snowstorm to come round the house; ,13236,13301
92," and like the noise of troops and the rage of battle was the storm, beating and pouring in on every side, so that drifts of deep snow were piled against the walls, blocking the doors and chilling the folk that were feasting within the house. ",13300,13542
93,"But the King was lying in a heavy, unresting sleep, and Sheen was at his side. ",13542,13621
94,"Suddenly he screamed out of his sleep and stirred himself, for he heard the crash of falling timbers and the noise of the magic hosts, and he smelled the strong smell of fire in the palace. ",13621,13811
95,He sprang up. ,13811,13825
96,"""It seems to me,"" he cried, ""that hosts of demons are around the house, and that they are slaughtering my people, and that the house of Cletty is on fire."" ",13825,13981
97,"""It was but a dream,"" the witch maiden said. ",13981,14026
98,"Then he slept again, and he saw a vision, to wit, that he was tossing in a ship at sea, and the ship floundered, and above his head a griffin, with sharp beak and talons, sailed, her wings outspread and covering all the sun, so that it was dark as middle-night; ",14026,14288
99, and lo! ,14287,14296
100,"as she rose on high, her plumes quivered for a moment in the air; ",14296,14362
101," then down she swooped and picked him from the waves, carrying him to her eyrie on the dismal cliff outhanging o'er the ocean; ",14361,14488
102," and the griffin began to pierce him and to prod him with her talons, and to pick out pieces of his flesh with her beak; ",14487,14608
103," and this went on awhile, and then a flame, that came he knew not whence, rose from the nest, and he and the griffin were enveloped in the flame. ",14607,14753
104,"Then in her beak the griffin picked him up, and together they fell downward over the cliff's edge into the seething ocean; ",14753,14876
105," so that, half by fire and half by water, he died a miserable death. ",14875,14944
106,"When the King saw that vision, he rose screaming from his sleep, and donned his arms; ",14944,15030
107," and he made one plunge forward seeking for the magic hosts, but he found no man to answer him. ",15029,15125
108,"The damsel went forth from the house, and Murtough made to follow her, but as he turned the flames leaped out, and all between him and the door was one vast sheet of flame. ",15125,15298
109,"He saw no way of escape, save the vat of wine that stood in the banqueting hall, and into that he got; ",15298,15401
110," but the burning timbers of the roof fell upon his head and the hails of fiery sparks rained on him, so that half of him was burned and half was drowned, as he had seen in his dream. ",15400,15583
111,"The next day, amid the embers, the clerics found his corpse, and they took it up and washed it in the Boyne, and carried it to Tuilen to bury it. ",15583,15729
112,"And they said, ""Alas! ",15729,15751
113,"that Mac Erca, High King of Erin, of the noble race of Conn and of the descendants of Ugaine the Great, should die fighting with sods and stones! ",15751,15897
114,Alas! ,15745,15751
115,"that the Cross of Christ was not signed upon his face that he might have known the witchdoms of the maiden what they were."" ",15903,16027
116,"As they went thus, bewailing the death of Murtough and bearing him to his grave, Duivsech, wife of Murtough, met them, and when she found her husband dead, she struck her hands together and she made a great and mournful lamentation; ",16027,16260
117, and because weakness came upon her she leaned her back against the ancient tree that is in Aenech Reil; ,16259,16364
118," and a burst of blood broke from her heart, and there she died, grieving for her husband. ",16363,16453
119,"And the grave of Murtough was made wide and deep, and there they laid the Queen beside him, two in the one grave, near the north side of the little church that is in Tuilen. ",16453,16627
120,"Now, when the burial was finished, and the clerics were reciting over his grave the deeds of the King, and were making prayers for Murtough's soul that it might be brought out of hell, for Cairnech showed great care for this, they saw coming towards them across the sward a lonely woman, star-bright and beautiful, and a kirtle of priceless silk upon her, and a green mantle with its fringes of silver thread flowing to the ground. ",16627,17059
121,"She reached the place where the clerics were, and saluted them, and they saluted her. ",17059,17145
122,"And they marvelled at her beauty, but they perceived on her an appearance of sadness and of heavy grief. ",17145,17250
123,"They asked of her, ""Who art thou, maiden, and wherefore art thou come to the house of mourning? ",17250,17346
124,"For a king lies buried here."" ",17346,17376
125,"""A king lies buried here, indeed,"" said she, ""and I it was who slew him, Murtough of the many deeds, of the race of Conn and Niall, High King of Ireland and of the West. ",17376,17546
126,"And though it was I who wrought his death, I myself will die for grief of him."" ",17546,17626
127,"And they said, ""Tell us, maiden, why you brought him to his death, if so be that he was dear to thee?"" ",17626,17729
128,"And she said, ""Murtough was dear to me, indeed, dearest of the men of the whole world; ",17729,17816
129," for I am Sheen, the daughter of Sige, the son of Dian, from whom Ath Sigi or the 'Ford of Sige' is called to-day. ",17815,17930
130,"But Murtough slew my father, and my mother and sister were slain along with him, in the battle of Cerb upon the Boyne, and there was none of my house to avenge their death, save myself alone. ",17930,18122
131,"Moreover, in his time the Ancient Peoples of the Fairy Tribes of Erin were scattered and destroyed, the folk of the underworld and of my fatherland; ",18122,18271
132, and to avenge the wrong and loss he wrought on them I slew the man I loved. ,18270,18347
133,I made poison for him; ,18347,18370
134, alas! ,18369,18376
135,"I made for him magic drink and food which took his strength away, and out of the sods of earth and puff-balls that float down the wind, I wrought men and armies of headless, hideous folk, till all his senses were distraught. ",18376,18601
136,"And, now, take me to thee, O Cairnech, in fervent and true repentance, and sign the Cross of Christ upon my brow, for the time of my death is come."" ",18601,18750
137,"Then she made penitence for the sin that she had sinned, and she died there upon the grave of grief and of sorrow after the King. ",18750,18880
138,"And they digged a grave lengthways across the foot of the wide grave of Murtough and his spouse, and there they laid the maiden who had wrought them woe. ",18880,19034
139,"And the clerics wondered at those things, and they wrote them and revised them in a book.",19034,19124
