0,"Once upon a time, all the people of a certain country had died, excepting two helpless children, a baby boy and a little girl. ",0,127
1,"When their parents died, these children were asleep. ",127,180
2,"The little girl, who was the elder, was the first to awake. ",180,240
3,"She looked around her, but seeing nobody beside her little brother, who lay smiling in his dreams, she quietly resumed her bed. ",240,368
4,"At the end of ten days her brother moved, without opening his eyes. ",368,436
5,"At the end of ten days more he changed his position, lying on the other side, and in this way he kept on sleeping for a long time; ",436,567
6," and pleasant, too, must have been his dreams, for his little sister never looked at him that he was not quite a little heaven of smiles and flashing lights, which beamed about his head and filled the lodge with a strange splendor. ",566,798
7,"The girl soon grew to be a woman, but the boy increased in stature very slowly. ",798,878
8,"It was a long time before he could even creep, and he was well advanced in years before he could stand alone. ",878,988
9,"When he was able to walk, his sister made him a little bow and arrows, and hung around his neck a small shell, saying: ""You shall be called Dais Imid, or He of the Little Shell."" ",988,1167
10,"Every day he would go out with his little bow, shooting at the small birds. ",1167,1243
11,The first bird he killed was a tom-tit. ,1243,1283
12,His sister was highly pleased when he took it to her. ,1283,1337
13,"She carefully prepared and stuffed it, and put it away for him. ",1337,1401
14,The next day he killed a red squirrel. ,1401,1440
15,"His sister preserved this, too. ",1440,1472
16,"The third day he killed a partridge, and this they had for their evening meal. ",1472,1551
17,"After this he acquired more courage, and would venture some distance from home. ",1551,1631
18,"His skill and success as a hunter daily increased, and he killed the deer, bear, moose, and other large animals inhabiting the forest. ",1631,1766
19,"At last, although so very small of stature, he became a great hunter, and all that he shot he brought home and shared with his sister; ",1766,1901
20," and whenever he entered the lodge, a light beamed about his head and filled the place with a strange splendor. ",1900,2012
21,"He had now arrived at the years of manhood, but he still remained a perfect infant in size. ",2012,2104
22,"One day, walking about in quest of game, he came to a small lake. ",2104,2170
23,It was in the winter season; ,2170,2199
24," and upon the ice of the lake he saw a man of giant height, employed killing beavers. ",2198,2284
25,"Comparing himself with this great man, he felt that he was no bigger than an insect. ",2284,2369
26,He seated himself on the shore and watched his movements. ,2369,2427
27,"When the large man had killed many beavers, he put them on a hand-sled which he had, and pursued his way home. ",2427,2538
28,"When he saw him retire, the dwarf hunter followed, and, wielding his magic shell, he cut off the tail of one of the beavers, and ran home with the prize. ",2538,2692
29,"The giant, on reaching his lodge with his sled-load of beavers, was surprised to find one of them shorn of its tail. ",2692,2809
30,The next day the little hero of the shell went to the same lake. ,2809,2874
31,"The giant, who had been busy there for some time, had already loaded his sled and commenced his return; ",2874,2978
32," but running nimbly forward and overtaking him, he succeeded in securing another of the beaver-tails. ",2977,3079
33,"""I wonder,"" said the giant, on reaching his lodge and overlooking his beavers, ""what dog it is that has thus cheated me. ",3079,3200
34,"Could I meet him, I would make his flesh quiver at the point of my javelin."" ",3200,3277
35,"The giant forgot that he had taken these very beavers out of a beaver-dam which belonged to the little shell-man and his sister, without permission. ",3277,3426
36,"The next day he pursued his hunting at the beaver-dam near the lake, and he was again followed by the little man with the shell. ",3426,3555
37,"This time the giant was so nimble in his movements that he had nearly reached home before the Shell, make the best speed he could, could overtake him; ",3555,3706
38, but he was just in time to clip another beaver's tail before the sled slipped into the lodge. ,3705,3800
39,"The giant would have been a patient giant, indeed, if his anger had not been violent at these constant tricks played upon him. ",3800,3927
40,"What vexed him most, was, that he could not get a sight of his enemy. ",3927,3997
41,"Sharp eyes he would have needed to do so, inasmuch as he of the little shell had the gift of making himself invisible whenever he chose. ",3997,4134
42,"The giant, giving vent to his feelings with many loud rumbling words, looked sharply around to see whether he could discover any tracks. ",4134,4271
43,He could find none. ,4271,4291
44,The unknown had stepped too lightly to leave the slightest mark behind. ,4291,4363
45,The next day the giant resolved to disappoint his mysterious follower by going to the beaver-dam very early; ,4363,4472
46," and accordingly, when the little shell man came to the place he found the fresh traces of his work, but the giant had already gone away. ",4471,4609
47,"He followed hard upon his tracks, but he failed to overtake him. ",4609,4674
48,"When he of the little shell came in sight of the lodge, the stranger was in front of it, employed in skinning his beavers. ",4674,4797
49,"As Dais-Imid stood looking at him--for he had been all this time invisible--he thought: ""I will let him have a view of me."" ",4797,4921
50,"Presently the man, who proved to be no less a personage than the celebrated giant, Manabozho, looked up and saw him. ",4921,5038
51,"After regarding him with attention, ""Who are you, little man?"" ",5038,5101
52,said Manabozho. ,5101,5117
53,"""I have a mind to kill you."" ",5117,5146
54,"The little hero of the shell replied: ""If you were to try to kill me you could not do it."" ",5146,5237
55,"With this speech of the little man, Manabozho grabbed at him; ",5237,5299
56," but when he thought to have had him in his hand, he was gone. ",5298,5361
57,"""Where are you now, little man?"" ",5361,5394
58,cried Manabozho. ,5394,5411
59,"""Here, under your girdle,"" answered the shell-dwarf; ",5411,5464
60," at which giant Manabozho, thinking to crush him, slapped down his great hand with all his might; ",5463,5561
61, but on unloosing his girdle he was disappointed at finding no dwarf there. ,5560,5636
62,"""Where are you now, little man?"" ",5361,5394
63,"he cried again, in a greater rage than ever. ",5669,5714
64,"""In your right nostril!"" ",5714,5739
65,the dwarf replied; ,5739,5758
66," whereupon the giant Manabozho seized himself by the finger and thumb at the place, and gave it a violent tweak; ",5757,5870
67," but as he immediately heard the voice of the dwarf at a distance upon the ground, he was satisfied that he had only pulled his own nose to no purpose. ",5869,6021
68,"""Good-by, Manabozho,"" said the voice of the invisible dwarf. ",6021,6082
69,"""Count your beaver-tails, and you will find that I have taken another for my sister;""",6082,6167
70,""" for he of the little shell never, in his wanderings or pastimes, forgot his sister and her wishes. ",6166,6267
71,"""Good-by, beaver-man!"" ",6267,6290
72,"And as he went away he made himself visible once more, and a light beamed about his head and lit the air around him with a strange splendor; ",6290,6431
73," a circumstance which Manabozho, who was at times quite thick-headed and dull of apprehension, could no way understand. ",6430,6550
74,"When Dais-Imid returned home, he told his sister that the time drew nigh when they must separate. ",6550,6648
75,"""I must go away,"" said Dais-Imid, ""it is my fate. ",6648,6698
76,"You, too,"" he added, ""must go away soon. ",6698,6739
77,"Tell me where you would wish to dwell."" ",6739,6779
78,"She said, ""I would like to go to the place of the breaking of daylight. ",6779,6851
79,I have always loved the East. ,6851,6881
80,"The earliest glimpses of light are from that quarter, and it is to my mind the most beautiful part of the heavens. ",6881,6996
81,"After I get there, my brother, whenever you see the clouds, in that direction, of various colors, you may think that your sister is painting her face."" ",6996,7148
82,"""And I,"" said he, ""I, my sister, shall live on the mountains and rocks. ",7148,7220
83,There I can see you at the earliest hour; ,7220,7262
84, there are the streams of water clear; ,7261,7300
85," the air is pure, and the golden lights will shine ever around my head, and I shall ever be called 'Puck-Ininee, or the Little Wild Man of the Mountains.' ",7299,7454
86,"But,"" he resumed, ""before we part forever, I must go and try to find what manitoes rule the earth, and see which of them will be friendly to us."" ",7454,7600
87,"He left his sister and traveled over the surface of the globe, and then went far down into the earth. ",7600,7702
88,He had been treated well wherever he went. ,7702,7745
89,"At last he came to a giant manito, who had a large kettle which was forever boiling. ",7745,7830
90,"The giant, who was a first cousin to Manabozho, and had already heard of the tricks which Dais-Imid had played upon his kinsman, regarded him with a stern look, and, catching him up in his hand, he threw him unceremoniously into the kettle. ",7830,8071
91,It was evidently the giant's intention to drown Dais-Imid; ,8071,8130
92," in which he was mistaken, for by means of his magic shell, little Dais, in less than a second's time, bailed the water to the bottom, leaped from the kettle, and ran away unharmed. ",8129,8311
93,He returned to his sister and related his rovings and adventures. ,8311,8377
94,"He finished his story by addressing her thus: ""My sister there is a manito at each of the four corners of the earth. ",8377,8494
95,"There is also one above them, far in the sky, a Great Being who assigns to you, and to me, and to all of us, where we must go. ",8494,8621
96,"And last,"" he continued, ""there is another and wicked one who lives deep down in the earth. ",8621,8713
97,It will be our lot to escape out of his reach. ,8713,8760
98,We must now separate. ,8760,8782
99,"When the winds blow from the four corners of the earth, you must then go. ",8782,8856
100,They will carry you to the place you wish. ,8856,8899
101,"I go to the rocks and mountains, where my kindred will ever delight to dwell."" ",8899,8978
102,"Dais-Imid then took his ball-stick and commenced running up a high mountain, and a bright light shone about his head all the way, and he kept singing as he went: Blow, winds, blow! ",8978,9159
103,"my sister lingers For her dwelling in the sky, Where the morn, with rosy fingers, Shall her cheeks with vermil dye. ",9159,9275
104,"There my earliest views directed, Shall from her their color take, And her smiles, through clouds reflected, Guide me on by wood or lake. ",9275,9413
105,"While I range the highest mountains, Sport in valleys green and low, Or, beside our Indian fountains, Raise my tiny hip-hallo. ",9413,9540
106,"Presently the winds blew, and, as Dais-Imid had predicted, his sister was borne by them to the eastern sky, where she has ever since lived, and her name is now the Morning Star.",9540,9718
