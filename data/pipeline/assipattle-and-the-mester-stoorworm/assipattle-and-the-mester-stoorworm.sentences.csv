0,"In far bygone days, in the North, there lived a well-to-do farmer, who had seven sons and one daughter. ",0,104
1,And the youngest of these seven sons bore a very curious name; ,104,167
2," for men called him Assipattle, which means, ""He who grovels among the ashes."" ",166,245
3,"Perhaps Assipattle deserved his name, for he was rather a lazy boy, who never did any work on the farm as his brothers did, but ran about the doors with ragged clothes and unkempt hair, and whose mind was ever filled with wondrous stories of Trolls and Giants, Elves and Goblins. ",245,525
4,"When the sun was hot in the long summer afternoons, when the bees droned drowsily and even the tiny insects seemed almost asleep, the boy was content to throw himself down on the ash-heap amongst the ashes, and lie there, lazily letting them run through his fingers, as one might play with sand on the sea-shore, basking in the sunshine and telling stories to himself. ",525,894
5,"And his brothers, working hard in the fields, would point to him with mocking fingers, and laugh, and say to each other how well the name suited him, and of how little use he was in the world. ",894,1087
6,"And when they came home from their work, they would push him about and tease him, and even his mother would make him sweep the floor, and draw water from the well, and fetch peats from the peat-stack, and do all the little odd jobs that nobody else would do. ",1087,1346
7,"So poor Assipattle had rather a hard life of it, and he would often have been very miserable had it not been for his sister, who loved him dearly, and who would listen quite patiently to all the stories that he had to tell; ",1346,1570
8," who never laughed at him or told him that he was telling lies, as his brothers did. ",1569,1654
9,"But one day a very sad thing happened--at least, it was a sad thing for poor Assipattle. ",1654,1743
10,"For it chanced that the King of these parts had one only daughter, the Princess Gemdelovely, whom he loved dearly, and to whom he denied nothing. ",1743,1889
11,"And Princess Gemdelovely was in want of a waiting-maid, and as she had seen Assipattle's sister standing by the garden gate as she was riding by one day, and had taken a fancy to her, she asked her father if she might ask her to come and live at the Castle and serve her. ",1889,2161
12,"Her father agreed at once, as he always did agree to any of her wishes; ",2161,2233
13, and sent a messenger in haste to the farmer's house to ask if his daughter would come to the Castle to be the Princess's waiting-maid. ,2232,2368
14,"And, of course, the farmer was very pleased at the piece of good fortune which had befallen the girl, and so was her mother, and so were her six brothers, all except poor Assipattle, who looked with wistful eyes after his sister as she rode away, proud of her new clothes and of the rivlins which her father had made her out of cowhide, which she was to wear in the Palace when she waited on the Princess, for at home she always ran barefoot. ",2368,2811
15,"Time passed, and one day a rider rode in hot haste through the country bearing the most terrible tidings. ",2811,2917
16,"For the evening before, some fishermen, out in their boats, had caught sight of the Mester Stoorworm, which, as everyone knows, was the largest, and the first, and the greatest of all Sea-Serpents. ",2917,3115
17,"It was that beast which, in the Good Book, is called the Leviathan, and if it had been measured in our day, its tail would have touched Iceland, while its snout rested on the North Cape. ",3115,3302
18,"And the fishermen had noticed that this fearsome Monster had its head turned towards the mainland, and that it opened its mouth and yawned horribly, as if to show that it was hungry, and that, if it were not fed, it would kill every living thing upon the land, both man and beast, bird and creeping thing. ",3302,3608
19,For it was well known that its breath was so poisonous that it consumed as with a burning fire everything that it lighted on. ,3608,3734
20,"So that, if it pleased the awful creature to lift its head and put forth its breath, like noxious vapour, over the country, in a few weeks the fair land would be turned into a region of desolation. ",3734,3932
21,"As you may imagine, everyone was almost paralysed with terror at this awful calamity which threatened them; ",3932,4040
22," and the King called a solemn meeting of all his Counsellors, and asked them if they could devise any way of warding off the danger. ",4039,4172
23,"And for three whole days they sat in Council, these grave, bearded men, and many were the suggestions which were made, and many the words of wisdom which were spoken; ",4172,4339
24," but, alas! ",4338,4350
25,no one was wise enough to think of a way by which the Mester Stoorworm might be driven back. ,4350,4443
26,"At last, at the end of the third day, when everyone had given up hope of finding a remedy, the door of the Council Chamber opened and the Queen appeared. ",4443,4597
27,"Now the Queen was the King's second wife, and she was not a favourite in the Kingdom, for she was a proud, insolent woman, who did not behave kindly to her step-daughter, the Princess Gemdelovely, and who spent much more of her time in the company of a great Sorcerer, whom everyone feared and dreaded, than she did in that of the King, her husband. ",4597,4947
28,"So the sober Counsellors looked at her disapprovingly as she came boldly into the Council Chamber and stood up beside the King's Chair of State, and, speaking in a loud, clear voice, addressed them thus: ""Ye think that ye are brave men and strong, oh, ye Elders, and fit to be the Protectors of the People. ",4947,5254
29,"And so it may be, when it is mortals that ye are called on to face. ",5254,5322
30,But ye be no match for the foe that now threatens our land. ,5322,5382
31,Before him your weapons be but as straw. ,5382,5423
32,"It is not through strength of arm, but through sorcery, that he will be overcome. ",5423,5505
33,"So listen to my words, even though they be but those of a woman, and take counsel with the great Sorcerer, from whom nothing is hid, but who knoweth all the mysteries of the earth, and of the air, and of the sea."" ",5505,5719
34,"Now the King and his Counsellors liked not this advice, for they hated the Sorcerer, who had, as they thought, too much influence with the Queen; ",5719,5865
35," but they were at their wits' end, and knew not to whom to turn for help, so they were fain to do as she said and summon the Wizard before them. ",5864,6009
36,"And when he obeyed the summons and appeared in their midst, they liked him none the better for his looks. ",6009,6115
37,"For he was long, and thin, and awesome, with a beard that came down to his knee, and hair that wrapped him about like a mantle, and his face was the colour of mortar, as if he had always lived in darkness, and had been afraid to look on the sun. ",6115,6361
38,"But there was no help to be found in any other man, so they laid the case before him, and asked him what they should do. ",6361,6482
39,"And he answered coldly that he would think over the matter, and come again to the Assembly the following day and give them his advice. ",6482,6617
40,"And his advice, when they heard it, was like to turn their hair white with horror. ",6617,6700
41,"For he said that the only way to satisfy the Monster, and to make it spare the land, was to feed it every Saturday with seven young maidens, who must be the fairest who could be found; ",6700,6885
42," and if, after this remedy had been tried once or twice, it did not succeed in mollifying the Stoorworm and inducing him to depart, there was but one other measure that he could suggest, but that was so horrible and dreadful that he would not rend their hearts by mentioning it in the meantime. ",6884,7179
43,"And as, although they hated him, they feared him also, the Council had e'en to abide by his words, and pronounced the awful doom. ",7179,7309
44,"And so it came about that, every Saturday, seven bonnie, innocent maidens were bound hand and foot and laid on a rock which ran into the sea, and the Monster stretched out his long, jagged tongue, and swept them into his mouth; ",7309,7537
45," while all the rest of the folk looked on from the top of a high hill--or, at least, the men looked--with cold, set faces, while the women hid theirs in their aprons and wept aloud. ",7536,7718
46,"""Is there no other way,"" they cried, ""no other way than this, to save the land?"" ",7718,7799
47,But the men only groaned and shook their heads. ,7799,7847
48,"""No other way,"" they answered; ",7847,7878
49," ""no other way."" ",7877,7894
50,Then suddenly a boy's indignant voice rang out among the crowd. ,7894,7958
51,"""Is there no grown man who would fight that Monster, and kill him, and save the lassies alive? ",7958,8053
52,I would do it; ,8053,8068
53," I am not feared for the Mester Stoorworm."" ",8067,8111
54,"It was the boy Assipattle who spoke, and everyone looked at him in amazement as he stood staring at the great Sea-Serpent, his fingers twitching with rage, and his great blue eyes glowing with pity and indignation. ",8111,8326
55,"""The poor bairn's mad; ",8326,8349
56," the sight hath turned his head,"" they whispered one to another; ",8348,8413
57," and they would have crowded round him to pet and comfort him, but his elder brother came and gave him a heavy clout on the side of his head. ",8412,8554
58,"""Thou fight the Stoorworm!"" ",8554,8582
59,he cried contemptuously. ,8582,8607
60,"""A likely story! ",8607,8624
61,"Go home to thy ash-pit, and stop speaking havers;""",8624,8674
62,""" and, taking his arm, he drew him to the place where his other brothers were waiting, and they all went home together. ",8673,8793
63,But all the time Assipattle kept on saying that he meant to kill the Stoorworm; ,8793,8873
64," and at last his brothers became so angry at what they thought was mere bragging, that they picked up stones and pelted him so hard with them that at last he took to his heels and ran away from them. ",8872,9072
65,"That evening the six brothers were threshing corn in the barn, and Assipattle, as usual, was lying among the ashes thinking his own thoughts, when his mother came out and bade him run and tell the others to come in for their supper. ",9072,9305
66,"The boy did as he was bid, for he was a willing enough little fellow; ",9305,9375
67," but when he entered the barn his brothers, in revenge for his having run away from them in the afternoon, set on him and pulled him down, and piled so much straw on top of him that, had his father not come from the house to see what they were all waiting for, he would, of a surety, have been smothered. ",9374,9679
68,"But when, at supper-time, his mother was quarrelling with the other lads for what they had done, and saying to them that it was only cowards who set on bairns littler and younger than themselves, Assipattle looked up from the bicker of porridge which he was supping. ",9679,9946
69,"""Vex not thyself, Mother,"" he said, ""for I could have fought them all if I liked; ",9946,10028
70," ay, and beaten them, too."" ",10027,10055
71,"""Why didst thou not essay it then?"" ",10055,10091
72,cried everybody at once. ,10091,10116
73,"""Because I knew that I would need all my strength when I go to fight the Giant Stoorworm,"" replied Assipattle gravely. ",10116,10235
74,"And, as you may fancy, the others laughed louder than before. ",10235,10297
75,"Time passed, and every Saturday seven lassies were thrown to the Stoorworm, until at last it was felt that this state of things could not be allowed to go on any longer; ",10297,10467
76," for if it did, there would soon be no maidens at all left in the country. ",10466,10541
77,"So the Elders met once more, and, after long consultation, it was agreed that the Sorcerer should be summoned, and asked what his other remedy was. ",10541,10689
78,"""For, by our troth,"" said they, ""it cannot be worse than that which we are practising now."" ",10689,10781
79,"But, had they known it, the new remedy was even more dreadful than the old. ",10781,10857
80,"For the cruel Queen hated her step-daughter, Gemdelovely, and the wicked Sorcerer knew that she did, and that she would not be sorry to get rid of her, and, things being as they were, he thought that he saw a way to please the Queen. ",10857,11091
81,"So he stood up in the Council, and, pretending to be very sorry, said that the only other thing that could be done was to give the Princess Gemdelovely to the Stoorworm, then would it of a surety depart. ",11091,11295
82,"When they heard this sentence a terrible stillness fell upon the Council, and everyone covered his face with his hands, for no man dare look at the King. ",11295,11449
83,"But although his dear daughter was as the apple of his eye, he was a just and righteous Monarch, and he felt that it was not right that other fathers should have been forced to part with their daughters, in order to try and save the country, if his child was to be spared. ",11449,11722
84,"So, after he had had speech with the Princess, he stood up before the Elders, and declared, with trembling voice, that both he and she were ready to make the sacrifice. ",11722,11891
85,"""She is my only child,"" he said, ""and the last of her race. ",11891,11951
86,"Yet it seemeth good to both of us that she should lay down her life, if by so doing she may save the land that she loves so well."" ",11951,12082
87,"Salt tears ran down the faces of the great bearded men as they heard their King's words, for they all knew how dear the Princess Gemdelovely was to him. ",12082,12235
88,"But it was felt that what he said was wise and true, and that the thing was just and right; ",12235,12327
89," for it were better, surely, that one maiden should die, even although she were of Royal blood, than that bands of other maidens should go to their death week by week, and all to no purpose. ",12326,12517
90,"So, amid heavy sobs, the aged Lawman--he who was the chief man of the Council--rose up to pronounce the Princess's doom. ",12517,12638
91,"But, ere he did so, the King's Kemper--or Fighting-man--stepped forward. ",12638,12711
92,"""Nature teaches us that it is fitting that each beast hath a tail,"" he said; ",12711,12788
93," ""and this Doom, which our Lawman is about to pronounce, is in very sooth a venomous beast. ",12787,12879
94,"And, if I had my way, the tail which it would bear after it is this, that if the Mester Stoorworm doth not depart, and that right speedily, after he have devoured the Princess, the next thing that is offered to him be no tender young maiden, but that tough, lean old Sorcerer."" ",12879,13157
95,"And at his words there was such a great shout of approval that the wicked Sorcerer seemed to shrink within himself, and his pale face grew paler than it was before. ",13157,13322
96,"Now, three weeks were allowed between the time that the Doom was pronounced upon the Princess and the time that it was carried out, so that the King might send Ambassadors to all the neighbouring Kingdoms to issue proclamations that, if any Champion would come forward who was able to drive away the Stoorworm and save the Princess, he should have her for his wife. ",13322,13688
97,"And with her he should have the Kingdom, as well as a very famous sword that was now in the King's possession, but which had belonged to the great god Odin, with which he had fought and vanquished all his foes. ",13688,13899
98,"The sword bore the name of Sickersnapper, and no man had any power against it. ",13899,13978
99,"The news of all these things spread over the length and breadth of the land, and everyone mourned for the fate that was like to befall the Princess Gemdelovely. ",13978,14139
100,"And the farmer, and his wife, and their six sons mourned also;-",14139,14202
101,"--all but Assipattle, who sat amongst the ashes and said nothing. ",14201,14267
102,"When the King's Proclamation was made known throughout the neighbouring Kingdoms, there was a fine stir among all the young Gallants, for it seemed but a little thing to slay a Sea-Monster; ",14267,14457
103," and a beautiful wife, a fertile Kingdom, and a trusty sword are not to be won every day. ",14456,14546
104,"So six-and-thirty Champions arrived at the King's Palace, each hoping to gain the prize. ",14546,14635
105,"But the King sent them all out to look at the Giant Stoorworm lying in the sea with its enormous mouth open, and when they saw it, twelve of them were seized with sudden illness, and twelve of them were so afraid that they took to their heels and ran, and never stopped till they reached their own countries; ",14635,14944
106," and so only twelve returned to the King's Palace, and as for them, they were so downcast at the thought of the task that they had undertaken that they had no spirit left in them at all. ",14943,15130
107,And none of them dare try to kill the Stoorworm; ,15130,15179
108," so the three weeks passed slowly by, until the night before the day on which the Princess was to be sacrificed. ",15178,15291
109,"On that night the King, feeling that he must do something to entertain his guests, made a great supper for them. ",15291,15404
110,"But, as you may think, it was a dreary feast, for everyone was thinking so much about the terrible thing that was to happen on the morrow, that no one could eat or drink. ",15404,15575
111,"And when it was all over, and everybody had retired to rest, save the King and his old Kemperman, the King returned to the great hall, and went slowly up to his Chair of State, high up on the dais. ",15575,15773
112,It was not like the Chairs of State that we know nowadays; ,15773,15832
113," it was nothing but a massive Kist, in which he kept all the things which he treasured most. ",15831,15924
114,"The old Monarch undid the iron bolts with trembling fingers, and lifted the lid, and took out the wondrous sword Sickersnapper, which had belonged to the great god Odin. ",15924,16094
115,"His trusty Kemperman, who had stood by him in a hundred fights, watched him with pitying eyes. ",16094,16189
116,"""Why lift ye out the sword,"" he said softly, ""when thy fighting days are done? ",16189,16268
117,"Right nobly hast thou fought thy battles in the past, oh, my Lord! ",16268,16335
118,when thine arm was strong and sure. ,16335,16371
119,"But when folk's years number four score and sixteen, as thine do, it is time to leave such work to other and younger men."" ",16371,16494
120,"The old King turned on him angrily, with something of the old fire in his eyes. ",16494,16574
121,"""Wheest,"" he cried, ""else will I turn this sword on thee. ",16574,16632
122,"Dost thou think that I can see my only bairn devoured by a Monster, and not lift a finger to try and save her when no other man will? ",16632,16766
123,I tell thee--and I will swear it with my two thumbs crossed on Sickersnapper--that both the sword and I will be destroyed before so much as one of her hairs be touched. ,16766,16935
124,"So go, and thou love me, my old comrade, and order my boat to be ready, with the sail set and the prow pointed out to sea. ",16935,17058
125,I will go myself and fight the Stoorworm; ,17058,17100
126," and if I do not return, I will lay it on thee to guard my cherished daughter. ",17099,17178
127,"Peradventure, my life may redeem hers."" ",17178,17218
128,"Now that night everybody at the farm went to bed betimes, for next morning the whole family was to set out early, to go to the top of the hill near the sea, to see the Princess eaten by the Stoorworm. ",17218,17419
129,"All except Assipattle, who was to be left at home to herd the geese. ",17419,17488
130,The lad was so vexed at this--for he had great schemes in his head--that he could not sleep. ,17488,17581
131,"And as he lay tossing and tumbling about in his corner among the ashes, he heard his father and mother talking in the great box-bed. ",17581,17714
132,"And, as he listened, he found that they were having an argument. ",17714,17779
133,"""Tis such a long way to the hill overlooking the sea, I fear me I shall never walk it,"" said his mother. ",17779,17884
134,"""I think I had better bide at home."" ",17884,17921
135,"""Nay,"" replied her husband, ""that would be a bonny-like thing, when all the country-side is to be there. ",17921,18026
136,"Thou shalt ride behind me on my good mare Go-Swift."" ",18026,18079
137,"""I do not care to trouble thee to take me behind thee,"" said his wife, ""for methinks thou dost not love me as thou wert wont to do."" ",18079,18212
138,"""The woman's havering,"" cried the Goodman of the house impatiently. ",18212,18280
139,"""What makes thee think that I have ceased to love thee?"" ",18280,18337
140,"""Because thou wilt no longer tell me thy secrets,"" answered his wife. ",18337,18407
141,"""To go no further, think of this very horse, Go-Swift. ",18407,18462
142,"For five long years I have been begging thee to tell me how it is that, when thou ridest her, she flies faster than the wind, while if any other man mount her, she hirples along like a broken-down nag."" ",18462,18665
143,The Goodman laughed. ,18665,18686
144,"""Twas not for lack of love, Goodwife,"" he said, ""though it might be lack of trust. ",18686,18769
145,For women's tongues wag but loosely; ,18769,18806
146, and I did not want other folk to ken my secret. ,18805,18854
147,"But since my silence hath vexed thy heart, I will e'en tell it thee."" ",18854,18924
148,"""When I want Go-Swift to stand, I give her one clap on the left shoulder. ",18924,18998
149,"When I would have her go like any other horse, I give her two claps on the right. ",18998,19080
150,"But when I want her to fly like the wind, I whistle through the windpipe of a goose. ",19080,19165
151,"And, as I never ken when I want her to gallop like that, I aye keep the bird's thrapple in the left-hand pocket of my coat."" ",19165,19290
152,"""So that is how thou managest the beast,"" said the farmer's wife, in a satisfied tone; ",19290,19377
153," ""and that is what becomes of all my goose thrapples. ",19376,19430
154,Oh! ,19430,19434
155,"but thou art a clever fellow, Goodman; ",19434,19473
156," and now that I ken the way of it I may go to sleep."" ",19472,19526
157,Assipattle was not tumbling about in the ashes now; ,19526,19578
158," he was sitting up in the darkness, with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes. ",19577,19653
159,"His opportunity had come at last, and he knew it. ",19653,19703
160,He waited patiently till their heavy breathing told him that his parents were asleep; ,19703,19789
161," then he crept over to where his father's clothes were, and took the goose's windpipe out of the pocket of his coat, and slipped noiselessly out of the house. ",19788,19947
162,"Once he was out of it, he ran like lightning to the stable. ",19947,20007
163,"He saddled and bridled Go-Swift, and threw a halter round her neck, and led her to the stable door. ",20007,20107
164,"The good mare, unaccustomed to her new groom, pranced, and reared, and plunged; ",20107,20187
165," but Assipattle, knowing his father's secret, clapped her once on the left shoulder, and she stood as still as a stone. ",20186,20306
166,"Then he mounted her, and gave her two claps on the right shoulder, and the good horse trotted off briskly, giving a loud neigh as she did so. ",20306,20448
167,"The unwonted sound, ringing out in the stillness of the night, roused the household, and the Goodman and his six sons came tumbling down the wooden stairs, shouting to one another in confusion that someone was stealing Go-Swift. ",20448,20677
168,The farmer was the first to reach the door; ,20677,20721
169," and when he saw, in the starlight, the vanishing form of his favourite steed, he cried at the top of his voice: ""Stop thief, ho! ",20720,20850
170,"Go-Swift, whoa!"" ",20850,20867
171,And when Go-Swift heard that she pulled up in a moment. ,20867,20923
172,"All seemed lost, for the farmer and his sons could run very fast indeed, and it seemed to Assipattle, sitting motionless on Go-Swift's back, that they would very soon make up on him. ",20923,21106
173,"But, luckily, he remembered the goose's thrapple, and he pulled it out of his pocket and whistled through it. ",21106,21216
174,"In an instant the good mare bounded forward, swift as the wind, and was over the hill and out of reach of its pursuers before they had taken ten steps more. ",21216,21373
175,Day was dawning when the lad came within sight of the sea; ,21373,21432
176," and there, in front of him, in the water, lay the enormous Monster whom he had come so far to slay. ",21431,21532
177,"Anyone would have said that he was mad even to dream of making such an attempt, for he was but a slim, unarmed youth, and the Mester Stoorworm was so big that men said it would reach the fourth part round the world. ",21532,21748
178,"And its tongue was jagged at the end like a fork, and with this fork it could sweep whatever it chose into its mouth, and devour it at its leisure. ",21748,21896
179,"For all this, Assipattle was not afraid, for he had the heart of a hero underneath his tattered garments. ",21896,22002
180,"""I must be cautious,"" he said to himself, ""and do by my wits what I cannot do by my strength."" ",22002,22097
181,"He climbed down from his seat on Go-Swift's back, and tethered the good steed to a tree, and walked on, looking well about him, till he came to a little cottage on the edge of a wood. ",22097,22281
182,"The door was not locked, so he entered, and found its occupant, an old woman, fast asleep in bed. ",22281,22379
183,"He did not disturb her, but he took down an iron pot from the shelf, and examined it closely. ",22379,22473
184,"""This will serve my purpose,"" he said; ",22473,22512
185," ""and surely the old dame would not grudge it if she knew it was to save the Princess's life."" ",22511,22606
186,"Then he lifted a live peat from the smouldering fire, and went his way. ",22606,22678
187,"Down at the water's edge he found the King's boat lying, guarded by a single boatman, with its sails set and its prow turned in the direction of the Mester Stoorworm. ",22678,22845
188,"""It's a cold morning,"" said Assipattle. ",22845,22885
189,"""Art thou not well-nigh frozen sitting there? ",22885,22931
190,"If thou wilt come on shore, and run about, and warm thyself, I will get into the boat and guard it till thou returnest."" ",22931,23052
191,"""A likely story,"" replied the man. ",23052,23087
192,"""And what would the King say if he were to come, as I expect every moment he will do, and find me playing myself on the sand, and his good boat left to a smatchet like thee? ",23087,23261
193,"Twould be as much as my head is worth."" ",23261,23301
194,"""As thou wilt,"" answered Assipattle carelessly, beginning to search among the rocks. ",23301,23386
195,"""In the meantime, I must be looking for a wheen mussels to roast for my breakfast."" ",23386,23470
196,"And after he had gathered the mussels, he began to make a hole in the sand to put the live peat in. ",23470,23570
197,"The boatman watched him curiously, for he, too, was beginning to feel hungry. ",23570,23648
198,"Presently the lad gave a wild shriek, and jumped high in the air. ",23648,23714
199,"""Gold, gold!"" ",23714,23728
200,he cried. ,23728,23738
201,"""By the name of Thor, who would have looked to find gold here?"" ",23738,23802
202,This was too much for the boatman. ,23802,23837
203,"Forgetting all about his head and the King, he jumped out of the boat, and, pushing Assipattle aside, began to scrape among the sand with all his might. ",23837,23990
204,"While he was doing so, Assipattle seized his pot, jumped into the boat, pushed her off, and was half a mile out to sea before the outwitted man, who, needless to say, could find no gold, noticed what he was about. ",23990,24204
205,"And, of course, he was very angry, and the old King was more angry still when he came down to the shore, attended by his Nobles and carrying the great sword Sickersnapper, in the vain hope that he, poor feeble old man that he was, might be able in some way to defeat the Monster and save his daughter. ",24204,24506
206,But to make such an attempt was beyond his power now that his boat was gone. ,24506,24583
207,"So he could only stand on the shore, along with the fast assembling crowd of his subjects, and watch what would befall. ",24583,24703
208,And this was what befell! ,24703,24729
209,"Assipattle, sailing slowly over the sea, and watching the Mester Stoorworm intently, noticed that the terrible Monster yawned occasionally, as if longing for his weekly feast. ",24729,24905
210,"And as it yawned a great flood of sea-water went down its throat, and came out again at its huge gills. ",24905,25009
211,"So the brave lad took down his sail, and pointed the prow of his boat straight at the Monster's mouth, and the next time it yawned he and his boat were sucked right in, and, like Jonah, went straight down its throat into the dark regions inside its body. ",25009,25264
212,On and on the boat floated; ,25264,25292
213," but as it went the water grew less, pouring out of the Stoorworm's gills, till at last it stuck, as it were, on dry land. ",25291,25414
214,"And Assipattle jumped out, his pot in his hand, and began to explore. ",25414,25484
215,"Presently he came to the huge creature's liver, and having heard that the liver of a fish is full of oil, he made a hole in it and put in the live peat. ",25484,25637
216,Woe's me! ,25637,25647
217,but there was a conflagration! ,25647,25678
218,And Assipattle just got back to his boat in time; ,25678,25728
219," for the Mester Stoorworm, in its convulsions, threw the boat right out of its mouth again, and it was flung up, high and dry, on the bare land. ",25727,25872
220,"The commotion in the sea was so terrible that the King and his daughter--who by this time had come down to the shore dressed like a bride, in white, ready to be thrown to the Monster--and all his Courtiers, and all the country-folk, were fain to take refuge on the hill top, out of harm's way, and stand and see what happened next. ",25872,26204
221,And this was what happened next. ,26204,26237
222,"The poor, distressed creature--for it was now to be pitied, even although it was a great, cruel, awful Mester Stoorworm--tossed itself to and fro, twisting and writhing. ",26237,26407
223,"And as it tossed its awful head out of the water its tongue fell out, and struck the earth with such force that it made a great dent in it, into which the sea rushed. ",26407,26574
224,And that dent formed the crooked Straits which now divide Denmark from Norway and Sweden. ,26574,26664
225,"Then some of its teeth fell out and rested in the sea, and became the Islands that we now call the Orkney Isles; ",26664,26777
226," and a little afterwards some more teeth dropped out, and they became what we now call the Shetland Isles. ",26776,26883
227,After that the creature twisted itself into a great lump and died; ,26883,26950
228, and this lump became the Island of Iceland; ,26949,26994
229," and the fire which Assipattle had kindled with his live peat still burns on underneath it, and that is why there are mountains which throw out fire in that chilly land. ",26993,27163
230,"When at last it was plainly seen that the Mester Stoorworm was dead, the King could scarce contain himself with joy. ",27163,27280
231,"He put his arms round Assipattle's neck, and kissed him, and called him his son. ",27280,27361
232,"And he took off his own Royal Mantle and put it on the lad, and girded his good sword Sickersnapper round his waist. ",27361,27478
233,"And he called his daughter, the Princess Gemdelovely, to him, and put her hand in his, and declared that when the right time came she should be his wife, and that he should be ruler over all the Kingdom. ",27478,27682
234,"Then the whole company mounted their horses again, and Assipattle rode on Go-Swift by the Princess's side; ",27682,27789
235," and so they returned, with great joy, to the King's Palace. ",27788,27849
236,"But as they were nearing the gate Assipattle's sister, she who was the Princess's maid, ran out to meet him, and signed to the Princess to lout down, and whispered something in her ear. ",27849,28035
237,"The Princess's face grew dark, and she turned her horse's head and rode back to where her father was, with his Nobles. ",28035,28154
238,She told him the words that the maiden had spoken; ,28154,28205
239," and when he heard them his face, too, grew as black as thunder. ",28204,28269
240,"For the matter was this: The cruel Queen, full of joy at the thought that she was to be rid, once for all, of her step-daughter, had been making love to the wicked Sorcerer all the morning in the old King's absence. ",28269,28485
241,"""He shall be killed at once,"" cried the Monarch. ",28485,28534
242,"""Such behaviour cannot be overlooked."" ",28534,28573
243,"""Thou wilt have much ado to find him, your Majesty,"" said the girl, ""for it is more than an hour since he and the Queen fled together on the fleetest horses that they could find in the stables."" ",28573,28768
244,"""But I can find him,"" cried Assipattle; ",28768,28808
245, and he went off like the wind on his good horse Go-Swift. ,28807,28866
246,"It was not long before he came within sight of the fugitives, and he drew his sword and shouted to them to stop. ",28866,28979
247,"They heard the shout, and turned round, and they both laughed aloud in derision when they saw that it was only the boy who grovelled in the ashes who pursued them. ",28979,29143
248,"""The insolent brat! ",29143,29163
249,I will cut off his head for him! ,29163,29196
250,"I will teach him a lesson!"" ",29196,29224
251,cried the Sorcerer; ,29224,29244
252, and he rode boldly back to meet Assipattle. ,29243,29288
253,"For although he was no fighter, he knew that no ordinary weapon could harm his enchanted body; ",29288,29383
254, therefore he was not afraid. ,29382,29412
255,"But he did not count on Assipattle having the Sword of the great god Odin, with which he had slain all his enemies; ",29412,29528
256, and before this magic weapon he was powerless. ,29527,29575
257,"And, at one thrust, the young lad ran it through his body as easily as if he had been any ordinary man, and he fell from his horse, dead. ",29575,29713
258,"Then the Courtiers of the King, who had also set off in pursuit, but whose steeds were less fleet of foot than Go-Swift, came up, and seized the bridle of the Queen's horse, and led it and its rider back to the Palace. ",29713,29932
259,"She was brought before the Council, and judged, and condemned to be shut up in a high tower for the remainder of her life. ",29932,30055
260,Which thing surely came to pass. ,30055,30088
261,"As for Assipattle, when the proper time came he was married to the Princess Gemdelovely, with great feasting and rejoicing. ",30088,30212
262,And when the old King died they ruled the Kingdom for many a long year.,30212,30284
