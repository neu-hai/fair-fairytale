0,Once upon a time there was a king who was the wisest in all of the world. ,0,74
1,"So wise was he that no one had ever befooled him, which is a rare thing, I can tell you. ",74,163
2,"Now, this king had a daughter who was as pretty as a ripe apple, so that there was no end to the number of the lads who came asking to marry her. ",163,309
3,"Every day there were two or three of them dawdling around the house, so that at last the old king grew tired of having them always about. ",309,447
4,"So he sent word far and near that whoever should befool him might have the princess and half of the kingdom to boot, for he thought that it would be a wise man indeed who could trick him. ",447,635
5,"But the king also said, that whoever should try to befool him and should fail, should have a good whipping. ",635,743
6,This was to keep all foolish fellows away. ,743,786
7,"The princess was so pretty that there was no lack of lads who came to have a try for her and half of the kingdom, but every one of these went away with a sore back and no luck. ",786,963
8,"Now, there was a man who was well off in the world, and who had three sons; ",963,1039
9," the first was named Peter, and the second was named Paul. ",1038,1097
10,"Peter and Paul thought themselves as wise as anybody in all of the world, and their father thought as they did. ",1097,1209
11,"As for the youngest son, he was named Boots. ",1209,1254
12,"Nobody thought anything of him except that he was silly, for he did nothing but sit poking in the warm ashes all of the day. ",1254,1379
13,"One morning Peter spoke up and said that he was going to the town to have a try at befooling the king, for it would be a fine thing to have a princess in the family. ",1379,1545
14,"His father did not say no, for if anybody was wise enough to befool the king, Peter was the lad. ",1545,1642
15,"So, after Peter had eaten a good breakfast, off he set for the town, right foot foremost. ",1642,1732
16,After a while he came to the king's house and-rap! ,1732,1783
17,tap! ,1783,1788
18,tap!-he knocked at the door. ,1788,1817
19,Well; ,1817,1823
20, what did he want? ,1822,1841
21,Oh! ,1841,1845
22,he would only like to have a try at befooling the king. ,1845,1901
23,Very good; ,1901,1912
24, he should have his try. ,1911,1936
25,"He was not the first one who had been there that morning, early as it was. ",1936,2011
26,So Peter was shown in to the king. ,2011,2046
27,"""Oh, look!"" ",2046,2058
28,"said he, ""yonder are three black geese out in the court-yard"" But no, the king was not to be fooled so easily as all that. ",2058,2181
29,"""One goose is enough to look at at a time,"" said he; ",2181,2234
30," ""take him away and give him a whipping!"" ",2233,2275
31,"And so they did, and Peter went home bleating like a sheep. ",2275,2335
32,One day Paul spoke up. ,2335,2358
33,"""I should like to go and have a try for the princess, too,"" said he. ",2358,2427
34,"Well, his father did not say no, for, after all, Paul was the more clever of the two. ",2427,2513
35,So off Paul went as merrily as a duck in the rain. ,2513,2564
36,"By and by he came to the castle, and then he too was brought before the king just as Peter had been. ",2564,2665
37,"""Oh, look!"" ",2046,2058
38,"said he, ""yonder is a crow sitting in the tree with three white stripes on his back!"" ",2677,2763
39,But the king was not so silly as to be fooled in that way. ,2763,2822
40,"""Here is a Jack,"" said he, ""who will soon have more stripes on his back than he will like. ",2822,2913
41,"Take him away and give him his whipping!"" ",2913,2955
42,"Then it was done as the king had said, and Paul went away home bawling like a calf. ",2955,3039
43,One day up spoke Boots. ,3039,3063
44,"""I should like to go and have a try for the pretty princess, too,"" said he. ",3063,3139
45,At this they all stared and sniggered. ,3139,3178
46,What! ,3178,3184
47,"he go where his clever brothers had failed, and had nothing to show for the trying but a good beating? ",3184,3287
48,What had come over the lout! ,3287,3316
49,"Here was a pretty business, to be sure! ",3316,3356
50,That was what they all said. ,3356,3385
51,But all of this rolled away from Boots like water from a duck's back. ,3385,3455
52,"No matter, he would like to go and have a try like the others. ",3455,3518
53,"So he begged and begged until his father was glad to let him go to be rid of his teasing, if nothing else. ",3518,3625
54,Then Boots asked if he might have the old tattered hat that hung back of the chimney. ,3625,3711
55,"Oh, yes, he might have that if he wanted it, for nobody with good wits was likely to wear such a thing. ",3711,3815
56,"So Boots took the hat, and after he had brushed the ashes from his shoes set off for the town, whistling as he went. ",3815,3932
57,The first body whom he met was an old woman with a great load of earthenware pots and crocks on her shoulders. ,3932,4043
58,"""Good-day, mother,"" said Boots. ",4043,4075
59,"""Good-day, son,"" said she. ",4075,4102
60,"""What will you take for all of your pots and crocks?"" ",4102,4156
61,said Boots. ,4063,4075
62,"""Three shillings,"" said she. ",4168,4197
63,"""I will give you five shillings if you will come and stand in front of the king's house, and do thus and so when I say this and that,"" said Boots. ",4197,4344
64,"Oh, yes! ",4344,4353
65,she would do that willingly enough. ,4353,4389
66,"So Boots and the old woman went on together, and presently came to the king's house. ",4389,4474
67,"When they had come there, Boots sat down in front of the door and began bawling as loud as he could-""No, I will not! ",4474,4591
68,"I will not do it, I say! ",4591,4616
69,"No, I will not do it!"" ",4616,4639
70,"So he kept on, bawling louder and louder until he made such a noise that, at last, the king himself came out to see what all of the hubbub was about. ",4639,4789
71,"But when Boots saw him he only bawled out louder than ever, ""No, I will not! ",4789,4866
72,"I will not do it, I say!"" ",4866,4892
73,"""Stop! ",4892,4899
74,"stop!"" ",4899,4906
75,"cried the king, ""what is all this about?"" ",4906,4948
76,"""Why,"" said Boots, ""everybody wants to buy my cap, but I will not sell it! ",4948,5023
77,"I will not do it, I say!"" ",4866,4892
78,"""But, why should anybody want to buy such a cap as that?"" ",5049,5107
79,said the king. ,5107,5122
80,"""Because,"" said Boots, ""it is a fooling cap and the only one in all of the world."" ",5122,5205
81,"""A fooling cap!"" ",5205,5222
82,said the king. ,5107,5122
83,For he did not like to hear of such a cap as that coming into the town. ,5237,5309
84,"""Hum-m-m-m! ",5309,5321
85,I should like to see you fool somebody with it. ,5321,5369
86,"Could you fool that old body yonder with the pots and the crocks?"" ",5369,5436
87,"""Oh, yes! ",5436,5446
88,"that is easily enough done,"" said Boots, and without more ado he took off his tattered cap and blew into it. ",5446,5555
89,"Then he put it on his head again and bawled out, ""Break pots! ",5555,5617
90,"break pots!"" ",5617,5630
91,No sooner had he spoken these words than the old woman jumped up and began breaking and smashing her pots and crocks as though she had gone crazy. ,5630,5777
92,"That was what Boots had paid her five shillings for doing, but of it the king knew nothing. ",5777,5869
93,"""Hui!"" ",5869,5876
94,"said he to himself, ""I must buy that hat from the fellow or he will fool the princess away from me for sure and certain."" ",5876,5998
95,Then he began talking to Boots as sweetly as though he had honey in his mouth. ,5998,6077
96,Perhaps Boots would sell the hat to him? ,6077,6118
97,"Oh, no! ",6118,6126
98,Boots could not think of such a thing as selling his fooling cap. ,6126,6192
99,"Come, come; ",6192,6204
100," the king wanted that hat, and sooner than miss buying it he would give a whole bag of gold money for it. ",6203,6309
101,"At this Boots looked up and looked down, scratching his head. ",6309,6371
102,"Well, he supposed he would have to sell the hat some time, and the king might as well have it as anybody else. ",6371,6482
103,But for all that he did not like parting with it. ,6482,6532
104,"So the king gave Boots the bag of gold, and Boots gave the king the old tattered hat, and then he went his way. ",6532,6644
105,"After Boots had gone the king blew into the hat and blew into the hat, but though he blew enough breath into it to sail a big ship, he did not befool so much as a single titmouse. ",6644,6824
106,"Then, at last, he began to see that the fooling cap was good on nobody else's head but Boots's; ",6824,6920
107," and he was none too pleased at that, you may be sure. ",6919,6974
108,"As for Boots, with his bag of gold he bought the finest clothes that were to be had in the town, and when the next morning had come he started away bright and early for the king's house. ",6974,7161
109,"""I have come,"" said he, ""to marry the princess, if you please."" ",7161,7225
110,At this the king hemmed and hawed and scratched his head. ,7225,7283
111,Yes; ,7283,7288
112," Boots had befooled him sure enough, but, after all, he could not give up the princess for such a thing as that. ",7287,7400
113,"Still, he would give Boots another chance. ",7400,7443
114,"Now, there was the high-councillor, who was the wisest man in all of the world. ",7443,7523
115,Did Boots think that he could fool him also? ,7523,7568
116,"Oh, yes! ",4344,4353
117,Boots thought that it might be done. ,7577,7614
118,Very well; ,7614,7625
119," if he could befool the high-councillor so as to bring him to the castle the next morning against his will, Boots should have the princess and the half of the kingdom; ",7624,7792
120, if he did not do so he should have his beating. ,7791,7840
121,"Then Boots went away, and the king thought that he was rid of him now for good and all. ",7840,7928
122,"As for the high-councillor, he was not pleased with the matter at all, for he did not like the thought of being fooled by a clever rogue, and taken here and there against his will. ",7928,8109
123,"So when he had come home, he armed all of his servants with blunderbusses, and then waited to give Boots a welcome when he should come. ",8109,8245
124,But Boots was not going to fall into any such trap as that! ,8245,8305
125,No indeed! ,8305,8316
126,not he! ,8316,8324
127,The next morning he went quietly and bought a fine large meal-sack. ,8324,8392
128,"Then he put a black wig over his beautiful red hair, so that no one might know him. ",8392,8476
129,"After that he went to the place where the high-councillor lived, and when he had come there he crawled inside of the sack, and lay just beside the door of the house. ",8476,8642
130,"By and by came one of the maid servants to the door, and there lay the great meal-sack with somebody in it. ",8642,8750
131,"""Ach!"" ",8750,8757
132,"cried she, ""who is there?"" ",8757,8784
133,"But Boots only said, ""Sh-h-h-h-h!"" ",8784,8819
134,"Then the serving maid went back into the house, and told the high-councillor that one lay outside in a great meal-sack, and that all that he said was, ""Sh-h-h-h-h!"" ",8819,8984
135,So the councillor went himself to see what it was all about. ,8984,9045
136,"""What do you want here?"" ",9045,9070
137,said he. ,2418,2427
138,"""Sh-h-h-h-h!"" ",8805,8819
139,"said Boots, ""I am not to be talked to now. ",9093,9136
140,"This is a wisdom-sack, and I am learning wisdom as fast as a drake can eat peas."" ",9136,9218
141,"""And what wisdom have you learned?"" ",9218,9254
142,said the councillor. ,9254,9275
143,Oh! ,1841,1845
144,Boots had learned wisdom about everything in the world. ,9279,9335
145,"He had learned that the clever scamp who had fooled the king yesterday was coming with seventeen tall men to take the high-councillor, willy-nilly, to the castle that morning. ",9335,9511
146,When the high-councillor heard this he fell to trembling till his teeth rattled in his head. ,9511,9604
147,"""And have you learned how I can get the better of this clever scamp?"" ",9604,9674
148,said he. ,2418,2427
149,"Oh, yes! ",4344,4353
150,Boots had learned that easily enough. ,9692,9730
151,"So, good! ",9730,9740
152,"then if the wise man in the sack would tell the high-councillor how to escape the clever rogue, the high-councillor would give the wise man twenty dollars. ",9740,9896
153,"But no, that was not to be done; ",9896,9929
154, wisdom was not bought so cheaply as the high-councillor seemed to think. ,9928,10002
155,"Well, the councillor would give him a hundred dollars then. ",10002,10062
156,That was good! ,10062,10077
157,A hundred dollars were a hundred dollars. ,10077,10119
158,"If the councillor would give him that much he might get into the sack himself, and then he could learn all the wisdom that he wanted, and more besides. ",10119,10271
159,"So Boots crawled out of the sack, and the councillor paid his hundred dollars and crawled in. ",10271,10365
160,"As soon as he was in all snug and safe, Boots drew the mouth of the sack together and tied it tightly. ",10365,10468
161,"Then he flung sack, councillor, and all over his shoulder, and started away to the king's house, and anybody who met them could see with half an eye that the councillor was going against his will. ",10468,10665
162,"When Boots came to the king's castle he laid the councillor down in the goose-house, and then he went to the king. ",10665,10780
163,"When the king saw Boots again, he bit his lips with vexation. ",10780,10842
164,"""Well,"" said he, ""have you fooled the councillor?"" ",10842,10893
165,"""Oh, yes!"" ",10893,10904
166,"says Boots, ""I have done that."" ",10904,10936
167,And where was the councillor now? ,10936,10970
168,"Oh, Boots had just left him down in the goose-house. ",10970,11023
169,"He was tied up safe and sound in a sack, waiting till the king should send for him. ",11023,11107
170,"So the councillor was sent for, and when he came the king saw at once that he had been brought against his will. ",11107,11220
171,"""And now may I marry the princess?"" ",11220,11256
172,said Boots. ,4063,4075
173,But the king was not willing for him to marry the princess yet; ,11268,11332
174, no! ,6121,6126
175,no! ,6122,6126
176,Boots must not go so fast. ,11340,11367
177,There was more to be done yet. ,11367,11398
178,"If he would come to-morrow morning he might have the princess and welcome, but he would have to pick her out from among fourscore other maids just like her; ",11398,11555
179, did he think that he could do that? ,11554,11591
180,"Oh, yes! ",4344,4353
181,Boots thought that that might be easy enough to do. ,11600,11652
182,"So, good! ",9730,9740
183,then come to-morrow; ,11662,11683
184," but he must understand that if he failed he should have a good whipping, and be sent packing from the town. ",11682,11791
185,"So off went Boots, and the king thought that he was rid of him now, for he had never seen the princess, and how could he pick her out from among eighty others? ",11791,11951
186,But Boots was not going to give up so easily as all that! ,11951,12009
187,"No, not he! ",12009,12021
188,"He made a little box, and then he hunted up and down until he had caught a live mouse to put into it. ",12021,12123
189,"When the next morning came he started away to the king's house, taking his mouse along with him in the box. ",12123,12231
190,"There was the king, standing in the doorway, looking out into the street. ",12231,12305
191,When he saw Boots coming towards him he made a wry face. ,12305,12362
192,"""What!"" ",12362,12370
193,"said he, ""are you back again?"" ",12370,12401
194,"Oh, yes! ",4344,4353
195,Boots was back again. ,12410,12432
196,"And now if the princess was ready he would like to go and find her, for lost time was not to be gathered again like fallen apples. ",12432,12563
197,"So off they marched to a great room, and there stood eighty-and-one maidens, all as much alike as peas in the same dish. ",12563,12684
198,"Boots looked here and there, but, even if he had known the princess, he could not have told her from the others. ",12684,12797
199,But he was ready for all that. ,12797,12828
200,"Before any one knew what he was about, he opened the box, and out ran the little mouse among them all. ",12828,12931
201,"Then what a screaming, and a hubbub there was! ",12931,12978
202,"Many looked as though they would have liked to swoon, but only one of them did so. ",12978,13061
203,"As soon as the others saw what had happened, they forgot all about the mouse, and ran to her and fell to fanning her and slapping her hands and chafing her temples. ",13061,13226
204,"""This is the princess,"" said Boots. ",13226,13262
205,And so it was. ,13262,13277
206,"After that the king could think of nothing more to set Boots to do, so he let him marry the princess as he had promised, and have half of the kingdom to boot. ",13277,13436
207,That is all of this story. ,13436,13463
208,Only this: It is not always the silliest one that sits kicking his feet in the ashes at home.,13463,13557
