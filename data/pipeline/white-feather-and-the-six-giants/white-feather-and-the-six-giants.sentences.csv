0,"There was an old man living in the depth of a forest, with his grandson, whom he had taken in charge when quite an infant. ",0,123
1,"The child had no parents, brothers, or sisters; ",123,171
2," they had all been destroyed by six large giants, and he had been informed that he had no other relative living beside his grandfather. ",170,306
3,"The band to whom he had belonged had put up their children on a wager in a race against those of the giants, and had thus lost them. ",306,439
4,"There was an old tradition in the tribe, that, one day, it would produce a great man, who would wear a white feather, and who would astonish every one by his feats of skill and bravery. ",439,625
5,"The grandfather, as soon as the child could play about, gave him a bow and arrows to amuse himself with. ",625,730
6,"He went into the edge of the woods one day, and saw a rabbit; ",730,792
7," but not knowing what it was, he ran home and described it to his grandfather. ",791,870
8,"He told him what it was, that its flesh was good to eat, and that if he would shoot one of his arrows into its body he would kill it. ",870,1004
9,"The boy went out again and brought home the little animal, which he asked his grandfather to boil, that they might feast on it. ",1004,1132
10,"He humored the boy in this, and he encouraged him to go on in acquiring the knowledge of hunting, until he could kill deer and the larger kinds of game; ",1132,1285
11," and he became, as he grew up, an expert hunter. ",1284,1333
12,"As they lived alone, and away from other Indians, the curiosity of the stripling was excited to know what was passing in the world. ",1333,1465
13,"One day he came to the edge of a prairie, where he saw ashes like those at his grandfather's lodge, and lodge-poles left standing. ",1465,1596
14,"He returned, and inquired whether his grandfather had put up the poles and made the fire. ",1596,1686
15,"He was answered, No. ",1686,1707
16,Nor did he believe that he had seen any thing of the kind. ,1707,1766
17,He must have lost his senses to be talking of such things. ,1766,1825
18,"Another day the young man went out to see what there was, within a day's hunt, that was curious; ",1825,1922
19," and on entering the woods he heard a voice calling out to him, ""Come here, you destined wearer of the White Feather. ",1921,2039
20,"You do not wear it, yet, but you are worthy of it. ",2039,2090
21,Return home and take a short nap. ,2090,2124
22,"You will dream of hearing a voice, which will tell you to rise and smoke. ",2124,2198
23,"You will see in your dream a pipe, a smoking-sack, and a large white feather. ",2198,2276
24,When you awake you will find these articles. ,2276,2321
25,"Put the feather on your head, and you will become a great hunter, a great warrior, and a great man, able to do any thing. ",2321,2443
26,"As a proof that these things shall come to pass, when you smoke, the smoke will turn into pigeons."" ",2443,2543
27,"The voice then informed the young man who he was, and made known the character of his grandfather, who was imposing upon him to serve his own ends. ",2543,2691
28,"The voice-spirit then caused a vine to be laid at his side, and told him that he was now of an age to avenge the wrongs of his kindred. ",2691,2827
29,"""When you meet your enemy,"" the spirit added, ""you will run a race with him. ",2827,2904
30,"He will not see the vine, because it is enchanted. ",2904,2955
31,"While you are running, you will throw it over his head and entangle him, so that you will win the race."" ",2955,3060
32,"Long before this speech was ended the young man had turned to the quarter from which the voice proceeded, and he was astonished to behold a man; ",3060,3205
33, for as yet he had never seen any human being beside his grandfather. ,3204,3274
34,"As he looked more keenly, he saw that this man, who had the looks of great age, was wood from the breast downward, and that he appeared to be fixed in the earth. ",3274,3436
35,"As his eye dwelt upon this strange being, the countenance by degrees faded away, and when he advanced to the spot whence it had addressed him, it was gone. ",3436,3592
36,He returned home; ,3592,3610
37, slept; ,3609,3617
38," in the midst of his slumbers, as from the hollow of the air, heard the voice; ",3616,3695
39, wakened and found the promised gifts. ,3694,3733
40,"His grandfather, when his attention was called to his awakening, was greatly surprised to find the youth with a white feather on his forehead, and to see flocks of pigeons flying out of his lodge. ",3733,3930
41,"He then remembered the old tradition, and knowing that now the day when he should lose control of his charge had begun, he bitterly bewailed the hour. ",3930,4081
42,"Possessed of his three magic gifts, the young man departed the next morning, to seek his enemies, and to demand revenge. ",4081,4202
43,The six giants lived in a very high lodge in the middle of a wood. ,4202,4269
44,"He traveled on, in good heart, till he reached this lodge, where he found that his coming had been made known by the little spirits who carry the news. ",4269,4421
45,"The giants hastened out, and gave a cry of joy as they saw him drawing near. ",4421,4498
46,"When he approached within hail, they began to make sport of him, saying, ""Here comes the little man with the white feather, who is to achieve such wonderful wonders."" ",4498,4665
47,"When, however, he had arrived among them, they spoke him fair, saying he was a brave man and would do brave things. ",4665,4781
48,"Their object was to encourage him, so that he would be bold to engage in some fool-hardy trial of strength. ",4781,4889
49,"Without paying much heed to their fine speeches, White Feather went fearlessly into their lodge; ",4889,4986
50," and without waiting for invitation, he challenged them to a foot-match. ",4985,5058
51,They agreed; ,5058,5071
52," and, as they said, by way of being easy with him, they told him to begin the race with the smallest of their number. ",5070,5188
53,"The point to which they were to run was a peeled tree toward the rising sun, and then back to the starting-place, which was a war-club of iron. ",5188,5332
54,"Whoever won this stake, was empowered to use it in dispatching the defeated champion. ",5332,5418
55,"If White Feather should overcome the first giant, he was to try the second, and so on, until they had all measured speed with him. ",5418,5549
56,"By a dexterous use of the vine, he gained the first race, struck down his competitor, and cut off his head. ",5549,5657
57,"The next morning he ran with the second giant, whom he also outran, killed and beheaded. ",5657,5746
58,"He went on in this way for the five mornings, always conquering by the aid of his vine, and lopping off the heads of the vanquished giants. ",5746,5886
59,"The last of the giants who was yet to run with him acknowledged his power, but prepared secretly to deceive him. ",5886,5999
60,"By way of parley, he proposed that White Feather should leave the heads with him, and that he would give him a handsome start for odds. ",5999,6135
61,"This White Feather declined, as he preferred to keep the heads as trophies of his victory. ",6135,6226
62,"Before going to the giant's lodge, on the sixth morning, he met his old counselor in the woods, standing rooted in the earth, as before. ",6226,6363
63,He told White Feather that he was about to be deceived; ,6363,6419
64," that he had never known any other sex but his own, but that as he went on his way to the lodge he would meet the most beautiful woman in the world. ",6418,6567
65,"He must pay no attention to her, but as soon as he caught her eye he must wish himself changed into an elk. ",6567,6675
66,"The change would take place immediately, and he must go to feeding and not look at her again. ",6675,6769
67,"White Feather thanked his kind adviser, and when he turned to take his leave he was gone as before. ",6769,6869
68,"He proceeded toward the lodge, met the female as had been foretold to him, and became an elk. ",6869,6963
69,She reproached him that he had cast aside the form of a man that he might avoid her. ,6963,7048
70,"""I have traveled a great distance,"" she added, ""to see you and to become your wife; ",7048,7132
71," for I have heard of your great achievements, and admire you very much."" ",7131,7204
72,"Now this woman was the sixth giant, who had assumed this disguise to entrap White Feather. ",7204,7295
73,"Without a suspicion of her real character, her reproaches and her beauty affected him so deeply that he wished himself a man again, and he at once resumed his natural shape. ",7295,7469
74,"They sat down together, and he began to caress and to make love to her. ",7469,7541
75,"Soothed by her smiles and her gracious manners, he ventured to lay his head on her lap, and in a little while he fell into a deep slumber. ",7541,7680
76,"Even then, such was her fear of White Feather, she doubted whether his sleep might not be feigned. ",7680,7779
77,"To assure herself she pushed his head aside, and seeing that he remained unconscious, she quickly assumed her own form as the sixth giant, took the plume from the brow of White Feather and placed it upon his own head, and with a sudden blow of his war-club changed him into a dog, in which degraded form he followed his enemy to the lodge. ",7779,8119
78,"While these things were passing, there were living in an Indian village at some distance, two sisters, the daughters of a chief, who were rivals, and they were at that very time fasting to acquire power, for the purpose of enticing the wearer of the white feather to visit their lodge. ",8119,8405
79,"They each secretly hoped to engage his affections, and each had built a lodge in the border of the village encampment. ",8405,8524
80,"The giant knowing this, and having become possessed of the magic plume, went immediately to visit them. ",8524,8628
81,"As he approached, the sisters, who were on the look-out at their lodge-doors, espied and recognized the feather. ",8628,8741
82,"The eldest sister had prepared her lodge with great show, and all the finery she could command, so as to attract the eye. ",8741,8863
83,"The youngest touched nothing in her lodge, but left it in its ordinary state. ",8863,8941
84,"The eldest went out to meet the giant, and invited him in. ",8941,9000
85,"He accepted her invitation, and made her his wife. ",9000,9051
86,"The youngest sister invited the enchanted dog into her lodge, prepared him a good supper and a neat bed, and treated him with much attention. ",9051,9193
87,"The giant, supposing that whoever possessed the white feather possessed also all its virtues, went out upon the prairie to hunt, hallooing aloud to the game to come and be killed; ",9193,9373
88," but the great hubbub he kept up scared them away, and he returned at night with nothing but himself; ",9372,9474
89," for he had shouted so lustily all day long that he had been even obliged to leave the mighty halloo, with which he had set out, behind. ",9473,9610
90,The dog went out the same day hunting upon the banks of a river. ,9610,9675
91,"He stole quietly along to the spot, and stepping into the water he drew out a stone, which instantly became a beaver. ",9675,9793
92,"The next day the giant followed the dog, and hiding behind a tree, he watched the manner in which the dog hunted in the river when he drew out a stone, which at once turned into a beaver. ",9793,9981
93,"""Ah, ha!"" ",9981,9991
94,"said the giant to himself, ""I will catch some beaver for myself."" ",9991,10057
95,"And as soon as the dog had left the place, the giant went to the river, and, imitating the dog, he drew out a stone, and was delighted to see it, as soon as it touched the land, change into a fine fat beaver. ",10057,10266
96,"Tying it to his belt he hastened home, shouting a good deal, and brandishing the white feather about, as if he were prepared now to show them what he could do when he once tried. ",10266,10445
97,"When he reached home he threw it down, as is the custom, at the door of the lodge before he entered. ",10445,10546
98,"After being seated a short time, he gave a dry cough, and bade his wife bring in his hunting girdle. ",10546,10647
99,"She made dispatch to obey him, and presently returned with the girdle, with nothing tied to it but a stone. ",10647,10755
100,"The next day, the dog finding that his method of catching beavers had been discovered, went to a wood at some distance, and broke off a charred limb from a burned tree, which instantly became a bear. ",10755,10955
101,"The giant, who appeared to have lost faith in his hulla-balooing, had again watched him, did exactly as the dog had done, and carried a bear home; ",10955,11102
102," but his wife, when she came to go out for it, found nothing but a black stick tied to his belt. ",11101,11198
103,And so it happened with every thing. ,11198,11235
104,"Whatever the dog undertook, prospered; ",11235,11274
105," whatever the giant attempted, failed. ",11273,11312
106,"Every day the youngest sister had reason to be more proud of the poor dog she had asked into her lodge, and every day the eldest sister was made more aware, that though she had married the white feather, the virtues of the magic plume were not the personal property of the noisy giant. ",11312,11598
107,"At last the giant's wife determined that she would go to her father and make known to him what a valuable husband she had, and how he furnished her lodge with a great abundance of sticks and stones, which he would pass upon her for bear and beaver. ",11598,11847
108,"So, when her husband, whose brave halloo had now died away to a feeble chirp, had started for the hunt, she set out. ",11847,11964
109,"As soon as these two had gone away from the neighborhood, the dog made signs to his mistress to sweat him after the manner of the Indians. ",11964,12103
110,"He had always been a good dog, and she was willing to oblige him. ",12103,12169
111,She accordingly made a lodge just large enough for him to creep in. ,12169,12237
112,"She then put in heated stones, and poured water upon them, which raised a vapor that filled the lodge and searched with its warmth to the very heart's core of the enchanted dog. ",12237,12415
113,"When this had been kept up for the customary time, the enchanted dog was completely sweated away, and in his stead, as might have been expected, out came a very handsome young man, but, unhappily, without the power of speech. ",12415,12641
114,"In taking away the dog, it appears that the sweating-lodge had also carried off the voice with it. ",12641,12740
115,"Meantime the elder sister had reached her father's, and, with much circumstance and a very long face, had told him how that her sister was supporting an idle dog, and entertaining him as her husband. ",12740,12940
116,"In her anxiety to make known her sister's affairs and the great scandal she was bringing upon the family, the eldest forgot to say any thing of the sticks and stones which her own husband brought home for bears and beavers. ",12940,13164
117,"The old man suspecting that there was magic about her house, sent a deputation of young men and women to ask his youngest daughter to come to him, and to bring her dog along with her. ",13164,13348
118,"When the deputation reached the lodge, they were surprised to find, in the place of the dog, a fine young man; ",13348,13459
119," and on announcing their message, they all returned to the old chief, who was no less surprised at the change. ",13458,13569
120,He immediately assembled all the old and wise heads of the nation to come and be witnesses to the exploits which it was reported that the young man could perform. ,13569,13732
121,"The sixth giant, although neither very old nor very wise, thrust himself in among the relations of the old chief. ",13732,13846
122,"When they were all assembled and seated in a circle, the old chief took his pipe and filled it, and passed it to the Indians around, to see if any thing would happen when they smoked. ",13846,14030
123,"They passed it on until it came around to the Dog, who made a sign that it should be handed first to the giant, which was done. ",14030,14158
124,"And the giant puffed with all his might, and shook the white feather upon his head, and swelled his chest; ",14158,14265
125," but nothing came of it, except a great deal of smoke. ",14264,14319
126,The Dog then took it himself. ,14319,14349
127,He made a sign to them to put the white feather upon his head. ,14349,14412
128,"This was no sooner done, than he recovered his speech, and, beginning to draw upon the pipe at the same moment, behold, immense flocks of white and blue pigeons rushed from the smoke. ",14412,14596
129,"From that moment the sixth giant was looked upon as an impostor, and as soon as White Feather had, at the request of the company, faithfully recounted his history, the old chief, who was one of the best-hearted magicians that ever lived, ordered that the giant should be transformed into a dog, and turned into the middle of the village, where the boys should pelt him to death with clubs; ",14596,14986
130," which being done, the whole six giants were at an end, and never troubled that neighborhood again, forever after. ",14985,15100
131,"The chief then gave out a command, at the request of White Feather, that all the young men should employ themselves four days in making arrows. ",15100,15244
132,White Feather also asked for a buffalo robe. ,15244,15289
133,"This he cut into thin shreds, and in the night, when no one knew of it, he went and sowed them about the prairie in every direction. ",15289,15422
134,"At the end of the four days, he invited them to gather together all of their arrows, and to accompany him to a buffalo hunt. ",15422,15547
135,"When they got out upon the prairie, they found it covered with a great herd of buffaloes. ",15547,15637
136,"Of these they killed as many as they pleased, and, afterward, they had a grand festival in honor of White Feather's triumph over the giants. ",15637,15778
137,"All this being pleasantly over, White Feather got his wife to ask her father's permission to go with him on a visit to his grandfather. ",15778,15914
138,"The old chief replied to this application, that a woman must follow her husband into whatever quarter of the world he may choose to go. ",15914,16050
139,"Bidding farewell to all his friends, White Feather placed the plume in his frontlet, and taking his war-club in his hand, he led the way into the forest, followed by his faithful wife.",16050,16235
