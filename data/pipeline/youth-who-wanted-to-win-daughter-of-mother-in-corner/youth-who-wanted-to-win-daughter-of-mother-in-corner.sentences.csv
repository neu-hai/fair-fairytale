0,Once upon a time there was a woman who had a son. ,0,50
1,He was so lazy and slow that there was not a single blessed useful thing he would do. ,50,136
2,"But he liked to sing and to dance, and that is what he did all day long, and far into the night as well. ",136,241
3,"The longer this went on, the worse off his mother was. ",241,296
4,"The youth was growing, and he wanted so much to eat that it was barely possible to find it. ",296,388
5,"More and more went for his clothes the older he grew, since his clothes did not last long, as you may imagine, because the youth skipped and dance about without stopping, through forest and field. ",388,585
6,At length it was too much for his mother. ,585,627
7,"One day she told the young fellow that he ought at last to get to work, and really do something, or both of them would have to starve to death. ",627,771
8,"But the youth had no mind to do so, he said, and would rather try to win the daughter of the mother in the corner. ",771,886
9,"If he got her, then he would live happily ever after, and could sing and dance, and would not have to plague himself with work. ",886,1014
10,When the mother heard that she thought it might not be such a bad idea after all. ,1014,1096
11,"She dressed up the youth as well as she could, so that he would make a good showing when he came to the mother in the corner, and then he set forth. ",1096,1245
12,When he stepped out the sun was shining bright and warm. ,1245,1302
13,"It had rained during the night, and the ground was soft and full of water puddles. ",1302,1385
14,"The youth took the shortest path to the mother in the corner, and sang and danced, as he always did. ",1385,1486
15,"But suddenly, as he was hopping and skipping along, he came to a swamp, and there were only some logs laid down to cross it. ",1486,1611
16,"From the one log he had to jump over a puddle to a clump of grass, unless he wanted to dirty his shoes. ",1611,1715
17,And then he went kerflop! ,1715,1741
18,"The very moment he set foot on the clump of grass, he went down and down until he was standing in a dark, ugly hole. ",1741,1858
19,"At first he could see nothing at all, but when he had been there a little while, he saw that there was a rat, who was wiggling and waggling around, and had a bunch of keys hanging from her tail. ",1858,2053
20,"""Have you come, my boy?"" ",2053,2078
21,said the rat. ,2078,2092
22,"""I must thank you for coming to visit me: I have been expecting you for a long time. ",2092,2177
23,"I am sure you have come to win me, and I can well imagine that you are in a great hurry. ",2177,2266
24,But you must have a little patience. ,2266,2303
25,"I am to receive a large dower, and am not yet ready for the wedding. ",2303,2372
26,"I will do my best to see that we are married soon."" ",2372,2424
27,"When she had said this, she produced a couple of egg-shells, with all sorts of eatables such as rats eat. ",2424,2530
28,"She set them down before the youth, and said: ""Now you must sit down and help yourself, for I am sure you are tired and hungry."" ",2530,2659
29,The youth had no great appetite for this food. ,2659,2706
30,"""If I were only away and up above again,"" thought he, but he said nothing. ",2706,2781
31,"""Now I think you must surely want to get home again,"" said the rat. ",2781,2849
32,"""I am well aware that you are waiting impatiently for the wedding, and I will hurry all I can. ",2849,2944
33,"Take this linen thread along, and when you get up above, you must not turn around, but must go straight home, and as you go you must keep repeating: 'Short before and long behind!'"" ",2944,3126
34,and with that she laid a linen thread in his hand. ,3126,3177
35,"""Heaven be praised!"" ",3177,3198
36,said the youth when he was up above once more. ,3198,3245
37,"""I'll not go down there again in a hurry."" ",3245,3288
38,"But he held the thread in his hand, and danced and sang as usual. ",3288,3354
39,"And although he no longer had the rat-hole in mind, he began to hum: ""Short before and long behind! ",3354,3454
40,"Short before and long behind!"" ",3454,3485
41,"When he stood before the door at home, he turned around; ",3485,3542
42," and there lay many, many hundred yards of the finest linen, finer than the most skillful weaver could have spun. ",3541,3655
43,"""Mother, come out, come out!"" ",3655,3685
44,called and cried the youth. ,3685,3713
45,"His mother came darting out, and asked what was the matter. ",3713,3773
46,"And when she saw the linen, stretching as far as she could see, and then a bit, she could not believe her eyes, until the youth told her how it all happened. ",3773,3931
47,"But when she had heard that, and had tested the linen between her fingers, she was so pleased that she, too, began to sing and dance. ",3931,4065
48,"Then she took the linen, cut it, and sewed shirts from it for her son and herself. ",4065,4148
49,The remainder she took to town and sold for a good price. ,4148,4206
50,Then for a time they lived in all joy and comfort. ,4206,4257
51,But when that was over the woman had not a bite to eat in the house. ,4257,4326
52,"She told her son that it was the highest time for him to take service, and really do something, or else both of them would have to starve to death. ",4326,4474
53,"But the youth preferred to go to the mother in the corner, and try to win her daughter. ",4474,4562
54,"His mother did not think this such a bad idea, for now the youth was handsomely dressed, and made a good showing. ",4562,4676
55,"So she brushed him, and furbished him up as well as she could. ",4676,4739
56,"He himself took a pair of new shoes, and polished them till they shone like a mirror, and when he had done so, off he went. ",4739,4863
57,Everything happened as before. ,4863,4894
58,"When he stepped out, the sun was shining bright and warm. ",4894,4952
59,"It had rained during the night, and the road was soft and muddy, and every puddle was full of water. ",4952,5053
60,"The youth took the shortest way to the mother in the corner, and sang and danced and danced and sang, as he always did. ",5053,5173
61,"He followed another road, not the one he had taken before; ",5173,5232
62," but as he was hopping and skipping along, he suddenly came to the log across the swamp, and from the log he had to jump over a puddle to a clump of grass, unless he wanted to dirty his shoes. ",5231,5424
63,And then he went kerflop. ,5424,5450
64,"And he sank down and could not stop, until he reached a horrible, dark, ugly hole. ",5450,5533
65,At first he could see nothing; ,5533,5564
66," but after he had stood there a while, he discovered a rat with a bunch of keys at the end of her tail, which she was wiggling and waggling in front of him. ",5563,5720
67,"""Have you come, my boy?"" ",2053,2078
68,said the rat. ,2078,2092
69,"""You are welcome among us! ",5759,5786
70,It was kind of you to come and visit me again so soon. ,5786,5841
71,"No doubt you are very impatient, I can well imagine it. ",5841,5897
72,But you must really be patient a little while longer. ,5897,5951
73,"My trousseau is not quite complete, but by the time you come again all shall be ready."" ",5951,6039
74,When she had said this she offered him egg-shells containing all sorts of food such as rats like. ,6039,6137
75,"But it looked to the youth like food that had been eaten, and he said that he had no appetite. ",6137,6232
76,"""If I were only safely away, and up above again,"" thought he, but he said nothing. ",6232,6315
77,"After a time the rat said: ""Now I think you must surely want to get up above again. ",6315,6399
78,I will hurry on the wedding as quickly as I can. ,6399,6448
79,"And now take this woolen thread along, and when you get up above, you must not turn around, but go straight home, and underway you must keep on repeating: 'Short before and long behind!'"" ",6448,6636
80,and with that she laid the woolen thread in his hand. ,6636,6690
81,"""Thank heaven, I have escaped!"" ",6690,6722
82,said the youth to himself. ,6722,6749
83,"""I am sure I'll never go there again,"" and then he sang and danced again as usual. ",6749,6832
84,"He thought no more of the rat-hole, but fell to humming, and sang without stopping: ""Short before and long behind! ",6832,6947
85,"Short before and long behind!"" ",3454,3485
86,"When he stood at the door of the house, he happened to look around. ",6978,7046
87,"There lay the finest woolen goods, many hundred yards of it, stretching for half a mile, and so fine that no city counselor wore a coat of finer cloth. ",7046,7198
88,"""Mother, mother, come out, come out!"" ",7198,7236
89,cried the youth. ,3696,3713
90,"His mother came to the door, clasped her hands together over her head, and nearly fainted with joy when she saw all the fine goods. ",7253,7385
91,"And then the youth had to tell her how it had come to him, and all that had taken place, from beginning to end. ",7385,7497
92,"This brought them a small fortune, as you may imagine. ",7497,7552
93,"The youth had new clothes, and his mother went to town and sold the goods, yard by yard, and was handsomely paid for them. ",7552,7675
94,"And then she decorated her room, and she herself, in her old days, went about in such style that she might have been taken for some lady of distinction. ",7675,7828
95,"So they lived splendidly and happily, but finally this money, too, came to an end. ",7828,7911
96,"One day the woman had not a bite to eat left in the house, and told her son that now he had better look for work, and really do something, or both of them would starve to death. ",7911,8089
97,But the youth thought it would be much better to go to the mother in the corner and try to win her daughter. ,8089,8198
98,"This time his mother again agreed with him, and did not contradict the youth. ",8198,8276
99,"Now he had fine new clothes, and looked so distinguished that it seemed out of the question to her that such a good-looking fellow would be refused. ",8276,8425
100,"So she furbished him up and tricked him out in the handsomest way, and he himself took out his new shoes and polished them so brightly that you could see yourself in them, and when he had done so he set forth. ",8425,8635
101,This time he did not choose the shortest road. ,8635,8682
102,"He took a roundabout way, the longest he could find, for he did not want to go down to the rat again because he was sick of her eternal wiggling and waggling, and the talk about marriage. ",8682,8870
103,The weather and the road were exactly the same as when he had gone before. ,8870,8945
104,"The sun shone, the swamp and the puddles gleamed, and the youth sang and danced as usual. ",8945,9035
105,"And in the midst of his skipping and jumping, before he knew it, there he stood at the same crossing which led across the swamp. ",9035,9164
106,"There he had to jump over a puddle to a clump of grass, unless he wanted to dirty his brightly polished shoes. ",9164,9275
107,"""Kerflop!"" ",9275,9286
108,"and down he went, and did not stop until he stood once more in the same dark, ugly, dirty hole. ",9286,9382
109,At first he was pleased because he could see nothing. ,9382,9436
110,"But after he had stood there a while, he once more discovered the ugly rat who was so repulsive to him, with the bunch of keys hanging from her tail. ",9436,9586
111,"""Good-day, my boy,"" said the rat. ",9586,9620
112,"""You are welcome! ",9620,9638
113,"I see that you can no longer live without me, and I thank you. ",9638,9701
114,"And now everything is in readiness for our wedding, and we will go straight to church."" ",9701,9789
115,"Nothing will come of that, thought the youth, but he did not say a word. ",9789,9862
116,"Then the rat whistled, and at once every corner was alive with swarms of mice and small rats, and six large rats came dragging along a frying-pan. ",9862,10009
117,"Two mice sat up behind as grooms, and two sprang up in front to drive the coach. ",10009,10090
118,"Several seated themselves within, and the rat with the bunch of keys took her place in their midst. ",10090,10190
119,"To the youth she said: ""The road is a little narrow here, so you will have to walk beside the coach, sweetheart, until the road is broader. ",10190,10330
120,"And then you may sit beside me in the coach."" ",10330,10376
121,"""How fine that will be!"" ",10376,10401
122,thought the youth. ,10401,10420
123,"""If I were only safely up above once more, I would run away from the whole pack of them,"" thought he, but he said nothing. ",10420,10543
124,He went along with the procession as well as he could. ,10543,10598
125,"At times he had to crawl, at others he had to stoop, for the way was very narrow. ",10598,10680
126,"But when it grew better, he walked in advance, and looked about to see how he might most easily steal away and make off. ",10680,10801
127,"And then he suddenly heard a clear, beautiful voice behind him say: ""Now the road is good! ",10801,10892
128,"Come, sweetheart, and get into the coach!"" ",10892,10935
129,"The youth turned around quickly, and was so astonished that his nose and ears nearly fell off. ",10935,11030
130,"There stood a magnificent coach with six white horses, and in the coach sat a maiden as fair and beautiful as the sun, and about her were sitting others, as bright and kindly as the stars. ",11030,11219
131,"It was a princess and her playmates, who had all been enchanted together. ",11219,11293
132,"But now they were delivered, because he had come down to them, and had never contradicted. ",11293,11384
133,"""Come along now!"" ",11384,11402
134,said the princess. ,11402,11421
135,"Then the youth got into the coach, and drove to church with her. ",11421,11486
136,"And when they drove away from the church, the princess said: ""Now we will first drive to my home, and then we will send for your mother."" ",11486,11624
137,"""That's all very fine,"" thought the youth--he said nothing, but he thought it would be better, after all, to drive to his home, instead of down into the hideous rat-hole. ",11624,11795
138,"But suddenly they came to a beautiful castle, and there they turned in, for there it was they were to live. ",11795,11903
139,"And at once a fine coach with six horses was sent for the youth's mother, and when she came the wedding festivities began. ",11903,12026
140,"They celebrated for fourteen days, and perhaps they are celebrating yet. ",12026,12099
141,"We must hurry, and perhaps we may still get there in time, and can drink the groom's health and dance with the bride!",12099,12217
