0,In bygone days there lived a little Princess named Gold-Tree. ,0,62
1,She was one of the prettiest children in the whole world. ,62,120
2,"Although her mother was dead, she had a very happy life. ",120,177
3,"Her father loved her dearly, and thought that nothing was too much trouble so long as it gave his little daughter pleasure. ",177,301
4,"But by and by he married again, and then the little Princess's sorrows began. ",301,379
5,"For his new wife, whose name, curious to say, was Silver-Tree, was very beautiful, but she was also very jealous. ",379,493
6,"She made herself quite miserable for fear that, some day, she should meet someone who was better looking than she was herself. ",493,620
7,"When she found that her step-daughter was so very pretty, she took a dislike to her at once. ",620,713
8,She was always looking at her and wondering if people would think her prettier than she was. ,713,806
9,"And because, in her heart of hearts, she was afraid that they would do so. ",806,881
10,She was very unkind indeed to the poor girl. ,881,926
11,"At last, one day, when Princess Gold-Tree was quite grown up, the two ladies went for a walk to a little well. ",926,1037
12,"It was all surrounded by trees, in the middle of a deep glen. ",1037,1099
13,Now the water in this well was so clear that everyone who looked into it saw his face reflected on the surface. ,1099,1211
14,"The proud Queen loved to come and peep into its depths, so that she could see her own picture mirrored in the water. ",1211,1328
15,"But to-day, as she was looking in, what should she see but a little trout. ",1328,1403
16,It was swimming quietly backwards and forwards not very far from the surface. ,1403,1481
17,"""Troutie, troutie, answer me this one question,"" said the Queen. ",1481,1546
18,"""Am not I the most beautiful woman in the world?"" ",1546,1596
19,"""No, indeed, you are not,"" replied the trout promptly, jumping out of the water, as he spoke, in order to swallow a fly. ",1596,1717
20,"""Who is the most beautiful woman, then?"" ",1717,1758
21,asked the disappointed Queen. ,1758,1788
22,She had expected a far different answer. ,1788,1829
23,"""Thy step-daughter, the Princess Gold-Tree, without a doubt,"" said the little fish. ",1829,1913
24,"Then, frightened by the black look that came upon the jealous Queen's face, he dived to the bottom of the well. ",1913,2025
25,It was no wonder that he did so. ,2025,2058
26,"The Queen's expression was not pleasant to look at, as she darted an angry glance at her fair young step-daughter. ",2058,2173
27,She was busy picking flowers some little distance away. ,2173,2229
28,"Indeed, she was so annoyed at the thought that anyone should say that the girl was prettier than she was. ",2229,2335
29,She quite lost her self-control. ,2335,2368
30,"When she reached home she went up, in a violent passion, to her room, and threw herself on the bed, declaring that she felt very ill indeed. ",2368,2509
31,"It was in vain that Princess Gold-Tree asked her what the matter was, and if she could do anything for her. ",2509,2617
32,"She would not let the poor girl touch her, but pushed her away as if she had been some evil thing. ",2617,2716
33,"So at last the Princess had to leave her alone, and go out of the apartment, feeling very sad indeed. ",2716,2818
34,By and by the King came home from his hunting. ,2818,2865
35,He at once asked for the Queen. ,2865,2897
36,"He was told that she had been seized with sudden illness, and that she was lying on her bed in her own room. ",2897,3006
37,"No one, not even the Court Physician, who had been hastily summoned, could make out what was wrong with her. ",3006,3115
38,In great anxiety--for he really loved her--the King went up to her bedside. ,3115,3191
39,"He asked the Queen how she felt, and if there was anything that he could do to relieve her. ",3191,3283
40,"""Yes, there is one thing that you could do,"" she answered harshly. ",3283,3350
41,"""I know full well that, even although it is the only thing that will cure me, you will not do it."" ",3350,3449
42,"""No,"" said the King, ""I deserve better words from your mouth than these. ",3449,3522
43,"You know that I would give tyou anything that you care to ask, even if it be the half of my Kingdom."" ",3522,3624
44,"""Then give me thy daughter's heart to eat,"" cried the Queen. ",3624,3685
45,"""Unless I can obtain that, I will die, and that speedily."" ",3685,3744
46,"She spoke so wildly, and looked at him in such a strange fashion, that the poor King really thought that her brain was turned. ",3744,3871
47,He was at his wits' end what to do. ,3871,3907
48,"He left the room, and paced up and down the corridor in great distress. ",3907,3979
49,At last he remembered that that very morning the son of a great King had arrived from a country far over the sea. ,3979,4093
50,He asked for his daughter's hand in marriage. ,4093,4139
51,"""Here is a way out of the difficulty,"" he said to himself. ",4139,4198
52,"""This marriage pleases me well. ",4198,4230
53,I will have it celebrated at once. ,4230,4265
54,"Then, when my daughter is safe out of the country, I will send a lad up the hillside. ",4265,4351
55,He shall kill a he-goat. ,4351,4376
56,"I will have its heart prepared and dressed, and send it up to my wife. ",4376,4447
57,"Perhaps the sight of it will cure her of this madness."" ",4447,4503
58,"So he had the strange Prince summoned before him, and told him how the Queen had taken a sudden illness that had wrought on her brain. ",4503,4638
59,This had caused her to take a dislike to the Princess. ,4638,4693
60,"It seemed as if it would be a good thing if, with the maiden's consent, the marriage could take place at once, so that the Queen might be left alone to recover from her strange malady. ",4693,4878
61,Now the Prince was delighted to gain his bride so easily. ,4878,4936
62,"The Princess was glad to escape from her step-mother's hatred, so the marriage took place at once. ",4936,5035
63,The newly wedded pair set off across the sea for the Prince's country. ,5035,5106
64,Then the King sent a lad up the hillside to kill a he-goat. ,5106,5166
65,"When it was killed he gave orders that its heart should be dressed and cooked, and sent to the Queen's apartment on a silver dish. ",5166,5297
66,"And the wicked woman tasted it, believing it to be the heart of her step-daughter. ",5297,5380
67,"When she had done so, she rose from her bed and went about the Castle looking as well and hearty as ever. ",5380,5486
68,"I am glad to be able to tell you that the marriage of Princess Gold-Tree, which had come about in such a hurry, turned out to be a great success. ",5486,5632
69,"The Prince whom she had wedded was rich, and great, and powerful, and he loved her dearly. ",5632,5723
70,She was as happy as the day was long. ,5723,5761
71,So things went peacefully on for a year. ,5761,5802
72,"Queen Silver-Tree was satisfied and contented, because she thought that her step-daughter was dead. ",5802,5902
73,While all the time the Princess was happy and prosperous in her new home. ,5902,5976
74,"But at the end of the year it chanced that the Queen went once more to the well in the little glen, in order to see her face reflected in the water. ",5976,6125
75,"And it chanced also that the same little trout was swimming backwards and forwards, just as he had done the year before. ",6125,6246
76,And the foolish Queen determined to have a better answer to her question this time than she had last. ,6246,6348
77,"""Troutie, troutie,"" she whispered, leaning over the edge of the well, ""am not I the most beautiful woman in the world?"" ",6348,6468
78,"""By my truth, you are not,"" answered the trout, in his very straightforward way. ",6468,6549
79,"""Who is the most beautiful woman, then?"" ",1717,1758
80,"asked the Queen, her face growing pale at the thought that she had yet another rival. ",6590,6676
81,"""Why, your Majesty's step-daughter, the Princess Gold-Tree, to be sure,"" answered the trout. ",6676,6769
82,The Queen threw back her head with a sigh of relief. ,6769,6822
83,"""Well, at any rate, people cannot admire her now,"" she said. ",6822,6883
84,"""It is a year since she died. ",6883,6913
85,"I ate her heart for my supper."" ",6913,6945
86,"""Are you sure of that, your Majesty?"" ",6945,6983
87,"asked the trout, with a twinkle in his eye. ",6983,7027
88,"""It seems to me it is but a year since she married the gallant young Prince who came from abroad to seek her hand. ",7027,7142
89,"She returned with him to his own country."" ",7142,7185
90,When the Queen heard these words she turned quite cold with rage. ,7185,7251
91,She knew that her husband had deceived her. ,7251,7295
92,She rose from her knees and went straight home to the Palace. ,7295,7357
93,She hid her anger as best she could. ,7357,7394
94,"She asked him if he would give orders to have the Long Ship made ready, as she wished to go and visit her dear step-daughter. ",7394,7520
95,It was such a very long time since she had seen her. ,7520,7573
96,"The King was somewhat surprised at her request, but he was only too glad to think that she had got over her hatred towards his daughter. ",7573,7710
97,He gave orders that the Long Ship should be made ready at once. ,7710,7774
98,"Soon it was speeding over the water, its prow turned in the direction of the land where the Princess lived, steered by the Queen herself. ",7774,7912
99,She knew the course that the boat ought to take. ,7912,7961
100,She was in such haste to be at her journey's end that she would allow no one else to take the helm. ,7961,8061
101,Now it chanced that Princess Gold-Tree was alone that day. ,8061,8120
102,Her husband had gone a-hunting. ,8120,8152
103,And as she looked out of one of the Castle windows she saw a boat coming sailing over the sea towards the landing place. ,8152,8273
104,She recognised it as her father's Long Ship. ,8273,8318
105,She guessed only too well whom it carried on board. ,8318,8370
106,She was almost beside herself with terror at the thought. ,8370,8428
107,She knew that it was for no good purpose that Queen Silver-Tree had taken the trouble to set out to visit her. ,8428,8539
108,She felt that she would have given almost anything she possessed if her husband had but been at home. ,8539,8641
109,In her distress she hurried into the servants' hall. ,8641,8694
110,"""Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?"" ",8694,8734
111,"she cried, ""for I see my father's Long Ship coming over the sea. ",8734,8799
112,I know that my step-mother is on board. ,8799,8839
113,And if she hath a chance she will kill me. ,8839,8882
114,"She hateth me more than anything else upon earth."" ",8882,8933
115,Now the servants worshipped the ground that their young Mistress trod on. ,8933,9007
116,She was always kind and considerate to them. ,9007,9052
117,"When they saw how frightened she was, and heard her piteous words, they crowded round her, as if to shield her from any harm that threatened her. ",9052,9198
118,"""Do not be afraid, your Highness,"" they cried; ",9198,9245
119," ""we will defend thee with our very lives if need be. ",9244,9298
120,"But in case thy Lady Step-Mother should have the power to throw any evil spell over thee, we will lock you in the great Mullioned Chamber. ",9298,9437
121,"Then she cannot get nigh thee at all."" ",9437,9476
122,"Now the Mullioned Chamber was a strong-room, which was in a part of the castle all by itself. ",9476,9570
123,Its door was so thick that no one could possibly break through it. ,9570,9637
124,"The Princess knew that if she were once inside the room, with its stout oaken door between her and her step-mother, she would be perfectly safe from any mischief that that wicked woman could devise. ",9637,9836
125,"So she consented to her faithful servants' suggestion, and allowed them to lock her in the Mullioned Chamber. ",9836,9946
126,"So it came to pass that when Queen Silver-Tree arrived at the great door of the Castle, and commanded the lackey who opened it to take her to his Royal Mistress. ",9946,10108
127,"He told her, with a low bow, that that was impossible, because the Princess was locked in the strong-room of the Castle. ",10108,10229
128,"She could not get out, because no one knew where the key was. ",10229,10291
129,"(Which was quite true, for the old butler had tied it round the neck of the Prince's favourite sheep-dog. ",10291,10397
130,He had sent him away to the hills to seek his master.) ,10397,10452
131,"""Take me to the door of the apartment,"" commanded the Queen. ",10452,10513
132,"""At least I can speak to my dear daughter through it."" ",10513,10568
133,"And the lackey, who did not see what harm could possibly come from this, did as he was bid. ",10568,10660
134,"""If the key is really lost, and thou canst not come out to welcome me, dear Gold-Tree,"" said the deceitful Queen. ",10660,10774
135,"""At least put your little finger through the keyhole that I may kiss it."" ",10774,10848
136,"The Princess did so, never dreaming that evil could come to her through such a simple action. ",10848,10942
137,But it did. ,10942,10954
138,"For instead of kissing the tiny finger, her step-mother stabbed it with a poisoned needle. ",10954,11045
139,"So deadly was the poison, that, before she could utter a single cry, the poor Princess fell, as one dead, on the floor. ",11045,11165
140,"When she heard the fall, a smile of satisfaction crept over Queen Silver-Tree's face. ",11165,11251
141,"""Now I can say that I am the handsomest woman in the world,"" she whispered. ",11251,11327
142,She went back to the lackey who stood waiting at the end of the passage. ,11327,11400
143,"She told him that she had said all that she had to say to her daughter, and that now she must return home. ",11400,11507
144,"So the man attended her to the boat with all due ceremony, and she set sail for her own country. ",11507,11604
145,No one in the Castle knew that any harm had befallen their dear Mistress. ,11604,11678
146,"The Prince came home from his hunting with the key of the Mullioned Chamber, which he had taken from his sheep-dog's neck, in his hand. ",11678,11814
147,"He laughed when he heard the story of Queen Silver-Tree's visit, and told the servants that they had done well. ",11814,11926
148,Then he ran upstairs to open the door and release his wife. ,11926,11986
149,"But what was his horror and dismay, when he did so, to find her lying dead at his feet on the floor. ",11986,12087
150,He was nearly beside himself with rage and grief. ,12087,12137
151,He knew that a deadly poison such as Queen Silver-Tree had used would preserve the Princess's body so that it had no need of burial. ,12137,12270
152,"He had it laid on a silken couch and left in the Mullioned Chamber, so that he could go and look at it whenever he pleased. ",12270,12394
153,"He was so terribly lonely, however, that in a little time he married again. ",12394,12470
154,His second wife was just as sweet and as good as the first one had been. ,12470,12543
155,This new wife was very happy. ,12543,12573
156,There was only one little thing that caused her any trouble at all. ,12573,12641
157,She was too sensible to let it make her miserable. ,12641,12692
158,"That one thing was that there was one room in the Castle--a room which stood at the end of a passage by itself--which she could never enter, as her husband always carried the key. ",12692,12872
159,"And as, when she asked him the reason of this, he always made an excuse of some kind. ",12872,12958
160,"She made up her mind that she would not seem as if she did not trust him, so she asked no more questions about the matter. ",12958,13081
161,But one day the Prince chanced to leave the door unlocked. ,13081,13140
162,"As he had never told her not to do so, she went in. ",13140,13192
163,"There she saw Princess Gold-Tree lying on the silken couch, looking as if she were asleep. ",13192,13283
164,"""Is she dead, or is she only sleeping?"" ",13283,13323
165,she said to herself. ,13323,13344
166,She went up to the couch and looked closely at the Princess. ,13344,13405
167,"And there, sticking in her little finger, she discovered a curiously shaped needle. ",13405,13489
168,"""There hath been evil work here,"" she thought to herself. ",13489,13547
169,"""If that needle be not poisoned, then I know naught of medicine."" ",13547,13613
170,"And, being skilled in leechcraft, she drew it carefully out. ",13613,13674
171,In a moment Princess Gold-Tree opened her eyes and sat up. ,13674,13733
172,She presently she had recovered sufficiently to tell the Other Princess the whole story. ,13733,13822
173,"Now, if her step-mother had been jealous, the Other Princess was not jealous at all. ",13822,13907
174,"When she heard all that had happened, she clapped her little hands, crying, ""Oh, how glad the Prince will be. ",13907,14017
175,"Although he hath married again, I know that he loves you best."" ",14017,14081
176,That night the Prince came home from hunting looking very tired and sad. ,14081,14154
177,What his second wife had said was quite true. ,14154,14200
178,"Although he loved her very much, he was always mourning in his heart for his first dear love, Princess Gold-Tree. ",14200,14314
179,"""How sad you are!"" ",14314,14333
180,"exclaimed his wife, going out to meet him. ",14333,14376
181,"""Is there nothing that I can do to bring a smile to thy face?"" ",14376,14439
182,"""Nothing,"" answered the Prince wearily, laying down his bow, for he was too heart-sore even to pretend to be gay. ",14439,14553
183,"""Except to give thee back Gold-Tree,"" said his wife mischievously. ",14553,14620
184,"""And that can I do. ",14620,14640
185,"Thou wilt find her alive and well in the Mullioned Chamber."" ",14640,14701
186,"Without a word the Prince ran upstairs, and, sure enough, there was his dear Gold-Tree. ",14701,14789
187,She was sitting on the couch ready to welcome him. ,14789,14840
188,He was so overjoyed to see her that he threw his arms round her neck. ,14840,14910
189,He kissed her over and over again. ,14910,14945
190,"He forgot his poor second wife, who had followed him upstairs, and who now stood watching the meeting that she had brought about. ",14945,15075
191,"She did not seem to be sorry for herself, however. ",15075,15126
192,"""I always knew that thy heart yearned after Princess Gold-Tree,"" she said. ",15126,15201
193,"""And it is but right that it should be so. ",15201,15244
194,She was your first love. ,15244,15269
195,"Since she has come to life again, I will go back to mine own people."" ",15269,15339
196,"""No, indeed you will not,"" answered the Prince. ",15339,15387
197,"""It is you who have brought me this joy. ",15387,15428
198,"You will stay with us, and we shall all three live happily together. ",15428,15497
199,"And Gold-Tree and thee will become great friends."" ",15497,15548
200,And so it came to pass. ,15548,15572
201,For Princess Gold-Tree and the Other Princess soon became like sisters. ,15572,15644
202,They loved each other as if they had been brought up together all their lives. ,15644,15723
203,In this manner another year passed away. ,15723,15764
204,"One evening, in the old country, Queen Silver-Tree went, as she had done before, to look at her face in the water of the little well in the glen. ",15764,15910
205,"And, as had happened twice before, the trout was there. ",15910,15966
206,"""Troutie, troutie,"" she whispered, ""am not I the most beautiful woman in the world?"" ",15966,16051
207,"""By my truth, you are not,"" answered the trout, as he had answered on the two previous occasions. ",16051,16149
208,"""And who do you say is the most beautiful woman now?"" ",16149,16203
209,"asked the Queen, her voice trembling with rage and vexation. ",16203,16264
210,"""I have given her name to thee these two years back,"" answered the trout. ",16264,16338
211,"""The Princess Gold-Tree, of course."" ",16338,16375
212,"""But she is dead,"" laughed the Queen. ",16375,16413
213,"""I am sure of it this time. ",16413,16441
214,It is just a year since I stabbed her little finger with a poisoned needle. ,16441,16517
215,"I heard her fall down dead on the floor."" ",16517,16559
216,"""I would not be so sure of that,"" answered the trout. ",16559,16613
217,Without saying another word he dived straight down to the bottom of the well. ,16613,16691
218,After hearing his mysterious words the Queen could not rest. ,16691,16752
219,"At last she asked her husband to have the Long Ship prepared once more, so that she could go and see her step-daughter. ",16752,16872
220,The King gave the order gladly. ,16872,16904
221,It all happened as it had happened before. ,16904,16947
222,She steered the Ship over the sea with her own hands. ,16947,17001
223,When it was approaching the land it was seen and recognised by Princess Gold-Tree. ,17001,17084
224,The Prince was out hunting. ,17084,17112
225,"The Princess ran, in great terror, to her friend, the Other Princess, who was upstairs in her chamber. ",17112,17215
226,"""Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?"" ",8694,8734
227,she cried. ,17255,17266
228,"""I see my father's Long Ship coming. ",17266,17303
229,I know that my cruel step-mother is on board. ,17303,17349
230,"She will try to kill me, as she tried to kill me before. ",17349,17406
231,Oh! ,17406,17410
232,"come, let us escape to the hills."" ",17410,17445
233,"""Not at all,"" replied the Other Princess, throwing her arms round the trembling Gold-Tree. ",17445,17536
234,"""I am not afraid of thy Lady Step-Mother. ",17536,17578
235,Come with me. ,17578,17592
236,"We will go down to the sea shore to greet her."" ",17592,17640
237,So they both went down to the edge of the water. ,17640,17689
238,"When Queen Silver-Tree saw her step-daughter coming she pretended to be very glad, and sprang out of the boat and ran to meet her. ",17689,17820
239,She held out a silver goblet full of wine for her to drink. ,17820,17880
240,"""It is rare wine from the East,"" she said, ""and therefore very precious. ",17880,17953
241,"I brought a flagon with me, so that we might pledge each other in a loving cup."" ",17953,18034
242,"Princess Gold-Tree, who was ever gentle and courteous, would have stretched out her hand for the cup, had not the Other Princess stepped between her and her step-mother. ",18034,18204
243,"""Nay, Madam,"" she said gravely, looking the Queen straight in the face. ",18204,18276
244,"""It is the custom in this land for the one who offers a loving cup to drink from it first herself."" ",18276,18376
245,"""I will follow the custom gladly,"" answered the Queen, and she raised the goblet to her mouth. ",18376,18471
246,"But the Other Princess, who was watching for closely, noticed that she did not allow the wine that it contained to touch her lips. ",18471,18602
247,"So she stepped forward and, as if by accident, struck the bottom of the goblet with her shoulder. ",18602,18700
248,Part of its contents flew into the Queen's face. ,18700,18749
249,"Before she could shut her mouth, went down her throat. ",18749,18804
250,"So, because of her wickedness, she was, as the Good Book says, caught in her own net. ",18804,18890
251,"For she had made the wine so poisonous that, almost before she had swallowed it, she fell dead at the two Princesses' feet. ",18890,19014
252,No one was sorry for her. ,19014,19040
253,She really deserved her fate. ,19040,19070
254,"They buried her hastily in a lonely piece of ground, and very soon everybody had forgotten all about her. ",19070,19176
255,"As for Princess Gold-Tree, she lived happily and peacefully with her husband and her friend for the remainder of her life.",19176,19299
