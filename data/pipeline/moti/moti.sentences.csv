0,"Once upon a time there was a youth called Moti, who was very big and strong, but the clumsiest creature you can imagine. ",0,121
1,"So clumsy was he that he was always putting his great feet into the bowls of sweet milk or curds which his mother set out on the floor to cool, always smashing, upsetting, breaking, until at last his father said to him: 'Here, Moti, are fifty silver pieces which are the savings of years; ",121,410
2, take them and go and make your living or your fortune if you can.' ,409,477
3,"Then Moti started off one early spring morning with his thick staff over his shoulder, singing gaily to himself as he walked along. ",477,609
4,In one way and another he got along very well until a hot evening when he came to a certain city where he entered the travellers' 'serai' or inn to pass the night. ,609,773
5,"Now a serai, you must know, is generally just a large square enclosed by a high wall with an open colonnade along the inside all round to accommodate both men and beasts, and with perhaps a few rooms in towers at the corners for those who are too rich or too proud to care about sleeping by their own camels and horses. ",773,1093
6,"Moti, of course, was a country lad and had lived with cattle all his life, and he wasn't rich and he wasn't proud, so he just borrowed a bed from the innkeeper, set it down beside an old buffalo who reminded him of home, and in five minutes was fast asleep. ",1093,1351
7,"In the middle of the night he woke, feeling that he had been disturbed, and putting his hand under his pillow found to his horror that his bag of money had been stolen. ",1351,1520
8,"He jumped up quietly and began to prowl around to see whether anyone seemed to be awake, but, though he managed to arouse a few men and beasts by falling over them, he walked in the shadow of the archways round the whole serai without coming across a likely thief. ",1520,1785
9,"He was just about to give it up when he overheard two men whispering, and one laughed softly, and peering behind a pillar, he saw two Afghan horsedealers counting out his bag of money! ",1785,1970
10,Then Moti went back to bed! ,1970,1998
11,In the morning Moti followed the two Afghans outside the city to the horsemarket in which they horses were offered for sale. ,1998,2123
12,Choosing the best-looking horse amongst them he went up to it and said: 'Is this horse for sale? ,2123,2220
13,may I try it?' ,2220,2235
14,"and, the merchants assenting, he scrambled up on its back, dug in his heels, and off they flew. ",2235,2331
15,"Now Moti had never been on a horse in his life, and had so much ado to hold on with both hands as well as with both legs that the animal went just where it liked, and very soon broke into a break-neck gallop and made straight back to the serai where it had spent the last few nights. ",2331,2615
16,"'This will do very well,' thought Moti as they whirled in at the entrance. ",2615,2690
17,As soon as the horse had arrived at its table it stopped of its own accord and Moti immediately rolled off; ,2690,2798
18," but he jumped up at once, tied the beast up, and called for some breakfast. ",2797,2874
19,"Presently the Afghans appeared, out of breath and furious, and claimed the horse. ",2874,2956
20,'What do you mean?' ,2956,2976
21,"cried Moti, with his mouth full of rice, 'it's my horse; ",2976,3033
22," I paid you fifty pieces of silver for it--quite a bargain, I'm sure!' ",3032,3103
23,'Nonsense! ,3103,3114
24,"it is our horse,' answered one of the Afghans beginning to untie the bridle. ",3114,3191
25,"'Leave off,' shouted Moti, seizing his staff; ",3191,3237
26, 'if you don't let my horse alone I'll crack your skulls! ,3236,3294
27,you thieves! ,3294,3307
28,I know you! ,3307,3319
29,"Last night you took my money, so to-day I took your horse; ",3319,3378
30, that's fair enough!' ,3377,3399
31,"Now the Afghans began to look a little uncomfortable, but Moti seemed so determined to keep the horse that they resolved to appeal to the law, so they went off and laid a complaint before the king that Moti had stolen one of their horses and would not give it up nor pay for it. ",3399,3678
32,Presently a soldier came to summon Moti to the king; ,3678,3731
33," and, when he arrived and made his obeisance, the king began to question him as to why he had galloped off with the horse in this fashion. ",3730,3869
34,"But Moti declared that he had got the animal in exchange for fifty pieces of silver, whilst the horse merchants vowed that the money they had on them was what they had received for the sale of other horses; ",3869,4076
35," and in one way and another the dispute got so confusing that the king (who really thought that Moti had stolen the horse) said at last, 'Well, I tell you what I will do. ",4075,4246
36,"I will lock something into this box before me, and if he guesses what it is, the horse is his, and if he doesn't then it is yours.' ",4246,4378
37,"To this Moti agreed, and the king arose and went out alone by a little door at the back of the Court, and presently came back clasping something closely wrapped up in a cloth under his robe, slipped it into the little box, locked the box, and set it up where all might see. ",4378,4652
38,"'Now,' said the king to Moti, 'guess!' ",4652,4691
39,"It happened that when the king had opened the door behind him, Moti noticed that there was a garden outside: without waiting for the king's return he began to think what could be got out of the garden small enough to be shut in the box. ",4691,4928
40,'Is it likely to be a fruit or a flower? ,4928,4969
41,"No, not a flower this time, for he clasped it too tight. ",4969,5026
42,Then it must be a fruit or a stone. ,5026,5062
43,"Yet not a stone, because he wouldn't wrap a dirty stone in his nice clean cloth. ",5062,5143
44,Then it is a fruit! ,5143,5163
45,"And a fruit without much scent, or else he would be afraid that I might smell it. ",5163,5245
46,Now what fruit without much scent is in season just now? ,5245,5302
47,When I know that I shall have guessed the riddle!' ,5302,5353
48,"As has been said before, Moti was a country lad, and was accustomed to work in his father's garden. ",5353,5453
49,"He knew all the common fruits, so he thought he ought to be able to guess right; ",5453,5534
50," but so as not to let it seem too easy, he gazed up at the ceiling with a puzzled expression, and looked down at the floor with an air or wisdom and his fingers pressed against his forehead, and then he said, slowly, with his eyes on the king,-- 'It is freshly plucked! ",5533,5803
51,It is round and it is red! ,5803,5830
52,It is a pomegranate!' ,5830,5852
53,Now the king knew nothing about fruits except that they were good to eat; ,5852,5926
54," and, as for seasons, he asked for whatever fruit he wanted whenever he wanted it, and saw that he got it; ",5925,6032
55," so to him Moti's guess was like a miracle, and clear proof not only of his wisdom but of his innocence, for it was a pomegranate that he had put into the box. ",6031,6191
56,"Of course when the king marvelled and praised Moti's wisdom, everybody else did so too; ",6191,6279
57," and, whilst the Afghans went off crestfallen, Moti took the horse and entered the king's service. ",6278,6377
58,"Very soon after this, Moti, who continued to live in the serai, came back one wet and stormy evening to find that his precious horse had strayed. ",6377,6523
59,"Nothing remained of him but a broken halter cord, and no one knew what had become of him. ",6523,6613
60,"After inquiring of everyone who was likely to know, Moti seized the cord and his big staff and sallied out to look for him. ",6613,6737
61,"Away and away he tramped out of the city and into the neighbouring forest, tracking hoof-marks in the mud. ",6737,6844
62,"Presently it grew late, but still Moti wandered on until suddenly in the gathering darkness he came right upon a tiger who was contentedly eating his horse. ",6844,7001
63,'You thief!' ,7001,7014
64,"shrieked Moti, and ran up and, just as the tiger, in astonishment, dropped a bone--whack! ",7014,7104
65,came Moti's staff on his head with such good will that the beast was half stunned and could hardly breathe or see. ,7104,7219
66,"Then Moti continued to shower upon him blows and abuse until the poor tiger could hardly stand, whereupon his tormentor tied the end of the broken halter round his neck and dragged him back to the serai. ",7219,7423
67,"'If you had my horse,' he said, 'I will at least have you, that's fair enough!' ",7423,7503
68,"And he tied him up securely by the head and heels, much as he used to tie the horse; ",7503,7588
69," then, the night being far gone, he flung himself beside him and slept soundly. ",7587,7667
70,"You cannot imagine anything like the fright of the people in the serai, when they woke up and found a tiger--very battered but still a tiger--securely tethered amongst themselves and their beasts! ",7667,7864
71,"Men gathered in groups talking and exclaiming, and finding fault with the innkeeper for allowing such a dangerous beast into the serai, and all the while the innkeeper was just as troubled as the rest, and none dared go near the place where the tiger stood blinking miserably on everyone, and where Moti lay stretched out snoring like thunder. ",7864,8208
72,At last news reached the king that Moti had exchanged his horse for a live tiger; ,8208,8290
73," and the monarch himself came down, half disbelieving the tale, to see if it were really true. ",8289,8384
74,Someone at last awaked Moti with the news that his royal master was come; ,8384,8458
75," and he arose yawning, and was soon delightedly explaining and showing off his new possession. ",8457,8552
76,"The king, however, did not share his pleasure at all, but called up a soldier to shoot the tiger, much to the relief of all the inmates of the serai except Moti. ",8552,8714
77,"If the king, however, was before convinced that Moti was one of the wisest of men, he was now still more convinced that he was the bravest, and he increased his pay a hundredfold, so that our hero thought that he was the luckiest of men. ",8714,8952
78,"A week or two after this incident the king sent for Moti, who on arrival found his master in despair. ",8952,9054
79,"A neighbouring monarch, he explained, who had many more soldiers than he, had declared war against him, and he was at his wits' end, for he had neither money to buy him off nor soldiers enough to fight him--what was he to do? ",9054,9280
80,"'If that is all, don't you trouble,' said Moti. ",9280,9328
81,"'Turn out your men, and I'll go with them, and we'll soon bring this robber to reason.' ",9328,9416
82,"The king began to revive at these hopeful words, and took Moti off to his stable where he bade him choose for himself any horse he liked. ",9416,9554
83,"There were plenty of fine horses in the stalls, but to the king's astonishment Moti chose a poor little rat of a pony that was used to carry grass and water for the rest of the stable. ",9554,9739
84,'But why do you choose that beast?' ,9739,9775
85,said the king. ,9775,9790
86,"'Well, you see, your majesty,' replied Moti, 'there are so many chances that I may fall off, and if I choose one of your fine big horses I shall have so far to fall that I shall probably break my leg or my arm, if not my neck, but if I fall off this little beast I can't hurt myself much.' ",9790,10080
87,A very comical sight was Moti when he rode out to the war. ,10080,10139
88,"The only weapon he carried was his staff, and to help him to keep his balance on horseback he had tied to each of his ankles a big stone that nearly touched the ground as he sat astride the little pony. ",10139,10342
89,"The rest of the king's cavalry were not very numerous, but they pranced along in armour on fine horses. ",10342,10446
90,"Behind them came a great rabble of men on foot armed with all sorts of weapons, and last of all was the king with his attendants, very nervous and ill at ease. ",10446,10606
91,So the army started. ,10606,10627
92,"They had not very far to go, but Moti's little pony, weighted with a heavy man and two big rocks, soon began to lag behind the cavalry, and would have lagged behind the infantry too, only they were not very anxious to be too early in the fight, and hung back so as to give Moti plenty of time. ",10627,10921
93,"The young man jogged along more and more slowly for some time, until at last, getting impatient at the slowness of the pony, he gave him such a tremendous thwack with his staff that the pony completely lost his temper and bolted. ",10921,11151
94,"First one stone became untied and rolled away in a cloud of dust to one side of the road, whilst Moti nearly rolled off too, but clasped his steed valiantly by its ragged mane, and, dropping his staff, held on for dear life. ",11151,11376
95,"Then, fortunately the other rock broke away from his other leg and rolled thunderously down a neighbouring ravine. ",11376,11491
96,"Meanwhile the advanced cavalry had barely time to draw to one side when Moti came dashing by, yelling bloodthirsty threats to his pony: 'You wait till I get hold of you! ",11491,11661
97,I'll skin you alive! ,11661,11682
98,I'll wring your neck! ,11682,11704
99,I'll break every bone in your body!' ,11704,11741
100,"The cavalry thought that this dreadful language was meant for the enemy, and were filled with admiration of his courage. ",11741,11862
101,"Many of their horses too were quite upset by this whirlwind that galloped howling through their midst, and in a few minutes, after a little plunging and rearing and kicking, the whole troop were following on Moti's heels. ",11862,12084
102,"Far in advance, Moti continued his wild career. ",12084,12132
103,"Presently in his course he came to a great field of castor-oil plants, ten or twelve feet high, big and bushy, but quite green and soft. ",12132,12269
104,"Hoping to escape from the back of his fiery steed Moti grasped one in passing, but its roots gave way, and he dashed on, with the whole plant looking like a young tree flourishing in his grip. ",12269,12462
105,"The enemy were in battle array, advancing over the plain, their king with them confident and cheerful, when suddenly from the front came a desperate rider at a furious gallop. ",12462,12638
106,'Sire!' ,12638,12646
107,"he cried, 'save yourself! ",12646,12672
108,the enemy are coming!' ,12672,12695
109,'What do you mean?' ,2956,2976
110,said the king. ,9775,9790
111,"'Oh, sire!' ",12730,12742
112,"panted the messenger, 'fly at once, there is no time to lose. ",12742,12804
113,Foremost of the enemy rides a mad giant at a furious gallop. ,12804,12865
114,"He flourishes a tree for a club and is wild with anger, for as he goes he cries, ""You wait till I get hold of you! ",12865,12980
115,I'll skin you alive! ,11661,11682
116,I'll wring your neck! ,11682,11704
117,"I'll break every bone in your body!"" ",13023,13060
118,"Others ride behind, and you will do well to retire before this whirlwind of destruction comes upon you.' ",13060,13165
119,"Just then out of a cloud of dust in the distance the king saw Moti approaching at a hard gallop, looking indeed like a giant compared with the little beast he rode, whirling his castor-oil plant, which in the distance might have been an oak tree, and the sound of his revilings and shoutings came down upon the breeze! ",13165,13484
120,"Behind him the dust cloud moved to the sound of the thunder of hoofs, whilst here and there flashed the glitter of steel. ",13484,13606
121,"The sight and the sound struck terror into the king, and, turning his horse, he fled at top speed, thinking that a regiment of yelling giants was upon him; ",13606,13762
122, and all his force followed him as fast as they might go. ,13761,13819
123,"One fat officer alone could not keep up on foot with that mad rush, and as Moti came galloping up he flung himself on the ground in abject fear. ",13819,13964
124,"This was too much for Moti's excited pony, who shied so suddenly that Moti went flying over his head like a sky rocket, and alighted right on the top of his fat foe. ",13964,14130
125,Quickly regaining his feet Moti began to swing his plant round his head and to shout: 'Where are your men? ,14130,14237
126,Bring them up and I'll kill them. ,14237,14271
127,My regiments! ,14271,14285
128,"Come on, the whole lot of you! ",14285,14316
129,Where's your king? ,14316,14335
130,Bring him to me. ,14335,14352
131,Here are all my fine fellows coming up and we'll each pull up a tree by the roots and lay you all flat and your houses and towns and everything else! ,14352,14502
132,Come on!' ,14502,14512
133,"But the poor fat officer could do nothing but squat on his knees with his hands together, gasping. ",14512,14611
134,"At last, when he got his breath, Moti sent him off to bring his king, and to tell him that if he was reasonable his life should be spared. ",14611,14750
135,"Off the poor man went, and by the time the troops of Moti's side had come up and arranged themselves to look as formidable as possible, he returned with his king. ",14750,14913
136,"The latter was very humble and apologetic, and promised never to make war any more, to pay a large sum of money, and altogether do whatever his conqueror wished. ",14913,15075
137,"So the armies on both sides went rejoicing home, and this was really the making of the fortune of clumsy Moti, who lived long and contrived always to be looked up to as a fountain of wisdom, valour, and discretion by all except his relations, who could never understand what he had done to be considered so much wiser than anyone else.",15075,15411
