0,"There lived in Boston a wise and ancient chemist by the name of Dr. Daws, who dabbled somewhat in magic. ",0,105
1,"There also lived in Boston a young lady by the name of Claribel Sudds, who was possessed of much money, little wit and an intense desire to go upon the stage. ",105,264
2,"So Claribel went to Dr. Daws and said: ""I can neither sing nor dance; ",264,334
3, I cannot recite verse nor play upon the piano; ,333,381
4, I am no acrobat nor leaper nor high kicker; ,380,425
5, yet I wish to go upon the stage. ,424,458
6,"What shall I do?"" ",458,476
7,"""Are you willing to pay for such accomplishments?"" ",476,527
8,asked the wise chemist. ,527,551
9,"""Certainly,"" answered Claribel, jingling her purse. ",551,603
10,"""Then come to me to-morrow at two o'clock,"" said he. ",603,656
11,All that night he practiced what is known as chemical sorcery; ,656,719
12, so that when Claribel Sudds came next day at two o'clock he showed her a small box filled with compounds that closely resembled French bonbons. ,718,863
13,"""This is a progressive age,"" said the old man, ""and I flatter myself your Uncle Daws keeps right along with the procession. ",863,987
14,"Now, one of your old-fashioned sorcerers would have made you some nasty, bitter pills to swallow; ",987,1085
15, but I have consulted your taste and convenience. ,1084,1134
16,Here are some magic bonbons. ,1134,1163
17,If you eat this one with the lavender color you can dance thereafter as lightly and gracefully as if you had been trained a lifetime. ,1163,1297
18,After you consume the pink confection you will sing like a nightingale. ,1297,1369
19,Eating the white one will enable you to become the finest elocutionist in the land. ,1369,1453
20,"The chocolate piece will charm you into playing the piano better than Rubenstein, while after eating you lemon-yellow bonbon you can easily kick six feet above your head."" ",1453,1625
21,"""How delightful!"" ",1625,1643
22,"exclaimed Claribel, who was truly enraptured. ",1643,1689
23,"""You are certainly a most clever sorcerer as well as a considerate compounder,"" and she held out her hand for the box. ",1689,1808
24,"""Ahem!"" ",1808,1816
25,said the wise one; ,1816,1835
26," ""a check, please."" ",1834,1854
27,"""Oh, yes; ",1854,1864
28, to be sure! ,1863,1876
29,"How stupid of me to forget it,"" she returned. ",1876,1922
30,"He considerately retained the box in his own hand while she signed a check for a large amount of money, after which he allowed her to hold the box herself. ",1922,2078
31,"""Are you sure you have made them strong enough?"" ",2078,2127
32,"she inquired, anxiously; ",2127,2152
33," ""it usually takes a great deal to affect me."" ",2151,2198
34,"""My only fear,"" replied Dr. Daws, ""is that I have made them too strong. ",2198,2270
35,"For this is the first time I have ever been called upon to prepare these wonderful confections."" ",2270,2367
36,"""Don't worry,"" said Claribel; ",2367,2397
37," ""the stronger they act the better I shall act myself."" ",2396,2452
38,"She went away, after saying this, but stopping in at a dry goods store to shop, she forgot the precious box in her new interest and left it lying on the ribbon counter. ",2452,2621
39,Then little Bessie Bostwick came to the counter to buy a hair ribbon and laid her parcels beside the box. ,2621,2727
40,When she went away she gathered up the box with her other bundles and trotted off home with it. ,2727,2823
41,"Bessie never knew, until after she had hung her coat in the hall closet and counted up her parcels, that she had one too many. ",2823,2950
42,"Then she opened it and exclaimed: ""Why, it's a box of candy! ",2950,3011
43,Someone must have mislaid it. ,3011,3041
44,But it is too small a matter to worry about; ,3041,3086
45," there are only a few pieces."" ",3085,3116
46,So she dumped the contents of the box into a bonbon dish that stood upon the hall table and picking out the chocolate piece-she was fond of chocolates-ate it daintily while she examined her purchases. ,3116,3317
47,"These were not many, for Bessie was only twelve years old and was not yet trusted by her parents to expend much money at the stores. ",3317,3450
48,"But while she tried on the hair ribbon she suddenly felt a great desire to play upon the piano, and the desire at last became so overpowering that she went into the parlor and opened the instrument. ",3450,3649
49,"The little girl had, with infinite pains, contrived to learn two ""pieces"" which she usually executed with a jerky movement of her right hand and a left hand that forgot to keep up and so made dreadful discords. ",3649,3860
50,But under the influence of the chocolate bonbon she sat down and ran her fingers lightly over the keys producing such exquisite harmony that she was filled with amazement at her own performance. ,3860,4055
51,"That was the prelude, however. ",4055,4086
52,The next moment she dashed into Beethoven's seventh sonata and played it magnificently. ,4086,4174
53,"Her mother, hearing the unusual burst of melody, came downstairs to see what musical guest had arrived; ",4174,4278
54, but when she discovered it was her own little daughter who was playing so divinely she had an attack of palpitation of the heart (to which she was subject) and sat down upon a sofa until it should pass away. ,4277,4486
55,Meanwhile Bessie played one piece after another with untiring energy. ,4486,4556
56,"She loved music, and now found that all she need do was to sit at the piano and listen and watch her hands twinkle over the keyboard. ",4556,4690
57,Twilight deepened in the room and Bessie's father came home and hung up his hat and overcoat and placed his umbrella in the rack. ,4690,4820
58,Then he peeped into the parlor to see who was playing. ,4820,4875
59,"""Great Caesar!"" ",4875,4891
60,he exclaimed. ,4891,4905
61,"But the mother came to him softly with her finger on her lips and whispered: ""Don't interrupt her, John. ",4905,5010
62,Our child seems to be in a trance. ,5010,5045
63,"Did you ever hear such superb music?"" ",5045,5083
64,"""Why, she's an infant prodigy!"" ",5083,5115
65,gasped the astounded father. ,5115,5144
66,"""Beats Blind Tom all hollow! ",5144,5173
67,"It's-it's wonderful!"" ",5173,5195
68,"As they stood listening the senator arrived, having been invited to dine with them that evening. ",5195,5292
69,And before he had taken off his coat the Yale professor-a man of deep learning and scholarly attainments-joined the party. ,5292,5415
70,Bessie played on; ,5415,5433
71," and the four elders stood in a huddled but silent and amazed group, listening to the music and waiting for the sound of the dinner gong. ",5432,5570
72,"Mr. Bostwick, who was hungry, picked up the bonbon dish that lay on the table beside him and ate the pink confection. ",5570,5688
73,"The professor was watching him, so Mr. Bostwick courteously held the dish toward him. ",5688,5774
74,The professor ate the lemon-yellow piece and the senator reached out his hand and took the lavender piece. ,5774,5881
75,"He did not eat it, however, for, chancing to remember that it might spoil his dinner, he put it in his vest pocket. ",5881,5997
76,"Mrs. Bostwick, still intently listening to her precocious daughter, without thinking what she did, took the remaining piece, which was the white one, and slowly devoured it. ",5997,6171
77,"The dish was now empty, and Claribel Sudds' precious bonbons had passed from her possession forever! ",6171,6272
78,"Suddenly Mr. Bostwick, who was a big man, began to sing in a shrill, tremolo soprano voice. ",6272,6364
79,"It was not the same song Bessie was playing, and the discord was shocking that the professor smiled, the senator put his hands to his ears and Mrs. Bostwick cried in a horrified voice: ""William!"" ",6364,6560
80,"Her husband continued to sing as if endeavoring to emulate the famous Christine Nillson, and paid no attention whatever to his wife or his guests. ",6560,6707
81,"Fortunately the dinner gong now sounded, and Mrs. Bostwick dragged Bessie from the piano and ushered her guests into the dining-room. ",6707,6841
82,"Mr. Bostwick followed, singing ""The Last Rose of Summer"" as if it had been an encore demanded by a thousand delighted hearers. ",6841,6968
83,The poor woman was in despair at witnessing her husband's undignified actions and wondered what she might do to control him. ,6968,7093
84,The professor seemed more grave than usual; ,7093,7137
85," the senator's face wore an offended expression, and Bessie kept moving her fingers as if she still wanted to play the piano. ",7136,7262
86,"Mrs. Bostwick managed to get them all seated, although her husband had broken into another aria; ",7262,7359
87, and then the maid brought in the soup. ,7358,7398
88,"When she carried a plate to the professor, he cried, in an excited voice: ""Hold it higher! ",7398,7489
89,"Higher-I say!"" ",7489,7504
90,"And springing up he gave it a sudden kick that sent it nearly to the ceiling, from whence the dish descended to scatter soup over Bessie and the maid and to smash in pieces upon the crown of the professor's bald head. ",7504,7722
91,At this atrocious act the senator rose from his seat with an exclamation of horror and glanced at his hostess. ,7722,7833
92,"For some time Mrs. Bostwick had been staring straight ahead, with a dazed expression; ",7833,7919
93," but now, catching the senator's eye, she bowed gracefully and began reciting ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" in forceful tones. ",7918,8049
94,The senator shuddered. ,8049,8072
95,Such disgraceful rioting he had never seen nor heard before in a decent private family. ,8072,8160
96,"He felt that his reputation was at stake, and, being the only sane person, apparently, in the room, there was no one to whom he might appeal. ",8160,8302
97,The maid had run away to cry hysterically in the kitchen; ,8302,8360
98," Mr. Bostwick was singing ""O Promise Me;""",8359,8400
99,""" the professor was trying to kick the globes off the chandelier; ",8399,8465
100," Mrs. Bostwick had switched her recitation to ""The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck,"" and Bessie had stolen into the parlor and was pounding out the overture from the ""Flying Dutchman."" ",8464,8647
101,"The senator was not at all sure he would not go crazy himself, presently; ",8647,8721
102," so he slipped away from the turmoil, and, catching up his had and coat in the hall, hurried from the house. ",8720,8829
103,"That night he sat up late writing a political speech he was to deliver the next afternoon at Faneuil hall, but his experiences at the Bostwicks' had so unnerved him that he could scarcely collect his thoughts, and often he would pause and shake his head pityingly as he remembered the strange things he had seen in that usually respectable home. ",8829,9175
104,"The next day he met Mr. Bostwick in the street, but passed him by with a stony glare of oblivion. ",9175,9273
105,He felt he really could not afford to know this gentleman in the future. ,9273,9346
106,Mr. Bostwick was naturally indignant at the direct snub; ,9346,9403
107," yet in his mind lingered a faint memory of some quite unusual occurrences at his dinner party the evening before, and he hardly knew whether he dared resent the senator's treatment or not. ",9402,9592
108,"The political meeting was the feature of the day, for the senator's eloquence was well known in Boston. ",9592,9696
109,"So the big hall was crowded with people, and in one of the front rows sat the Bostwick family, with the learned Yale professor beside them. ",9696,9836
110,"They all looked tired and pale, as if they had passed a rather dissipated evening, and the senator was rendered so nervous by seeing them that he refused to look in their direction a second time. ",9836,10032
111,While the mayor was introducing him the great man sat fidgeting in his chair; ,10032,10110
112," and, happening to put his thumb and finger into his vest pocket, he found the lavender-colored bonbon he had placed there the evening before. ",10109,10252
113,"""This may clear my throat,"" thought the senator, and slipped the bonbon into his mouth. ",10252,10340
114,"A few minutes afterwards he arose before the vast audience, which greeted him with enthusiastic plaudits. ",10340,10446
115,"""My friends,"" began the senator, in a grave voice, ""this is a most impressive and important occasion."" ",10446,10549
116,"Then he paused, balanced himself upon his left foot, and kicked his right leg into the air in the way favored by ballet-dancers! ",10549,10678
117,"There was a hum of amazement and horror from the spectators, but the senator appeared not to notice it. ",10678,10782
118,"He whirled around upon the tips of his toes, kicked right and left in a graceful manner, and startled a bald-headed man in the front row by casting a languishing glance in his direction. ",10782,10969
119,"Suddenly Claribel Sudds, who happened to be present, uttered a scream and sprang to her feet. ",10969,11063
120,"Pointing an accusing finger at the dancing senator, she cried in a loud voice: ""That's the man who stole my bonbons! ",11063,11180
121,Seize him! ,11180,11191
122,Arrest him! ,11191,11203
123,"Don't let him escape!"" ",11203,11226
124,"But the ushers rushed her out of the hall, thinking she had gone suddenly insane; ",11226,11308
125," and the senator's friends seized him firmly and carried him out the stage entrance to the street, where they put him into an open carriage and instructed the driver to take him home. ",11307,11491
126,"The effect of the magic bonbon was still powerful enough to control the poor senator, who stood upon the rear seat of the carriage and danced energetically all the way home, to the delight of the crowd of small boys who followed the carriage and the grief of the sober-minded citizens, who shook their heads sadly and whispered that ""another good man had gone wrong."" ",11491,11859
127,It took the senator several months to recover from the shame and humiliation of this escapade; ,11859,11954
128," and, curiously enough, he never had the slightest idea what had induced him to act in so extraordinary a manner. ",11953,12067
129,"Perhaps it was fortunate the last bonbon had now been eaten, for they might easily have caused considerably more trouble than they did. ",12067,12203
130,Of course Claribel went again to the wise chemist and signed a check for another box of magic bonbons; ,12203,12306
131," but she must have taken better care of these, for she is now a famous vaudeville actress.",12305,12396
