0,ON the last house in the village there lay a stork's nest. ,0,59
1,"The mother stork sat in it with her four little ones, who were stretching out their heads with their pointed black bills that had not yet turned red. ",59,209
2,"At a little distance, on the top of the roof, stood the father stork, bolt upright and as stiff as could be. ",209,318
3,"That he might not appear quite idle while standing sentry, he had drawn one leg up under him, as is the manner of storks. ",318,440
4,"One might have taken him to be carved in marble, so still did he stand. ",440,512
5,"""It must look very grand for my wife to have a sentinel to guard her nest,"" he thought. ",512,600
6,"""They can't know that I am her husband and will, of course, conclude that I am commanded to stand here by her nest. ",600,716
7,"It looks aristocratic!"" ",716,740
8,"Below, in the street, a crowd of children were playing. ",740,796
9,"When they chanced to catch sight of the storks, one of the boldest of the boys began to sing the old song about the stork. ",796,919
10,"The others soon joined him, but each sang the words that he happened to have heard. ",919,1003
11,"This is one of the ways: ""Stork, stork, fly away; ",1003,1053
12, Stand not on one leg to-day. ,1052,1082
13,"Thy dear wife sits in the nest, To lull the little ones to rest. ",1082,1147
14,"""There's a halter for one, There's a stake for another, For the third there's a gun, And a spit for his brother!"" ",1147,1261
15,"""Only listen,"" said the young storks, ""to what the boys are singing. ",1261,1330
16,"Do you hear them say we're to be hanged and shot?"" ",1330,1381
17,"""Don't listen to what they say; ",1381,1413
18," if you don't mind, it won't hurt you,"" said the mother. ",1412,1469
19,"But the boys went on singing, and pointed mockingly at the sentinel stork. ",1469,1544
20,"Only one boy, whom they called Peter, said it was a shame to make game of animals, and he would not join in the singing at all. ",1544,1672
21,The mother stork tried to comfort her young ones. ,1672,1722
22,"""Don't mind them,"" she said; ",1722,1751
23," ""see how quiet your father stands on one leg there."" ",1750,1804
24,"""But we are afraid,"" said the little ones, drawing back their beaks into the nest. ",1804,1887
25,"The children assembled again on the next day, and no sooner did they see the storks than they again began their song: ""The first will be hanged, The second be hit."" ",1887,2052
26,"""Tell us, are we to be hanged and burned?"" ",2052,2095
27,asked the young storks. ,2095,2119
28,"""No, no; ",2119,2128
29," certainly not,"" replied the mother. ",2127,2164
30,"""You are to learn to fly, and then we shall pay a visit to the frogs. ",2164,2234
31,They will bow to us in the water and sing 'Croak! ,2234,2284
32,croak!' ,2284,2292
33,"and we shall eat them up, and that will be a great treat."" ",2292,2351
34,"""And then what?"" ",2351,2368
35,questioned the young storks. ,2368,2397
36,"""Oh, then all the storks in the land will assemble, and the autumn sports will begin; ",2397,2483
37," only then one must be able to fly well, for that is very important. ",2482,2551
38,"Whoever does not fly as he should will be pierced to death by the general's beak, so mind that you learn well, when the drill begins."" ",2551,2686
39,"""Yes, but then, after that, we shall be killed, as the boys say. ",2686,2751
40,Hark! ,2751,2757
41,"they are singing it again."" ",2757,2785
42,"""Attend to me and not to them,"" said the mother stork. ",2785,2840
43,"""After the great review we shall fly away to warm countries, far from here, over hills and forests. ",2840,2940
44,"To Egypt we shall fly, where are the three-cornered houses of stone, one point of which reaches to the clouds; ",2940,3051
45, they are called pyramids and are older than a stork can imagine. ,3050,3116
46,In that same land there is a river which overflows its banks and turns the whole country into mire. ,3116,3216
47,"We shall go into the mire and eat frogs."" ",3216,3258
48,"""Oh! ",3258,3263
49,"oh!"" ",3263,3268
50,exclaimed all the youngsters. ,3268,3298
51,"""Yes, it is indeed a delightful place. ",3298,3337
52,We need do nothing all day long but eat; ,3337,3378
53," and while we are feasting there so comfortably, in this country there is not a green leaf left on the trees. ",3377,3487
54,"It is so cold here that the very clouds freeze in lumps or fall down in little white rags."" ",3487,3579
55,"It was hail and snow that she meant, but she did not know how to say it better. ",3579,3659
56,"""And will the naughty boys freeze in lumps?"" ",3659,3704
57,asked the young storks. ,2095,2119
58,"""No, they will not freeze in lumps, but they will come near it, and they will sit moping and cowering in gloomy rooms while you are flying about in foreign lands, amid bright flowers and warm sunshine."" ",3728,3931
59,"Some time passed, and the nestlings had grown so large and strong that they could stand upright in the nest and look all about them. ",3931,4064
60,"Every day the father stork came with delicious frogs, nice little snakes, and other such dainties that storks delight in. ",4064,4186
61,How funny it was to see the clever feats he performed to amuse them! ,4186,4255
62,He would lay his head right round upon his tail; ,4255,4304
63," and sometimes he would clatter with his beak, as if it were a little rattle; ",4303,4381
64," or he would tell them stories, all relating to swamps and fens. ",4380,4445
65,"""Come, children,"" said the mother stork one day, ""now you must learn to fly."" ",4445,4523
66,And all the four young storks had to go out on the ridge of the roof. ,4523,4593
67,How they did totter and stagger about! ,4593,4632
68,"They tried to balance themselves with their wings, but came very near falling to the ground. ",4632,4725
69,"""Look at me!"" ",4725,4739
70,said the mother. ,1452,1469
71,"""This is the way to hold your head. ",4756,4792
72,And thus you must place your feet. ,4792,4827
73,Left! ,4827,4833
74,right! ,4833,4840
75,left! ,4840,4846
76,right! ,4833,4840
77,"that's what will help you on in the world."" ",4853,4897
78,"Then she flew a little way, and the young ones took a clumsy little leap. ",4897,4971
79,Bump! ,4971,4977
80,plump! ,4977,4984
81,"down they fell, for their bodies were still too heavy for them. ",4984,5048
82,"""I will not fly,"" said one of the young storks, as he crept back to the nest. ",5048,5126
83,"""I don't care about going to warm countries."" ",5126,5172
84,"""Do you want to stay here and freeze when the winter comes? ",5172,5232
85,"Will you wait till the boys come to hang, to burn, or to roast you? ",5232,5300
86,"Well, then, I'll call them."" ",5300,5329
87,"""Oh, no!"" ",5329,5339
88,"cried the timid stork, hopping back to the roof with the rest. ",5339,5402
89,By the third day they actually began to fly a little. ,5402,5456
90,"Then they had no doubt that they could soar or hover in the air, upborne by their wings. ",5456,5545
91,"And this they attempted to do, but down they fell, flapping their wings as fast as they could. ",5545,5640
92,"Again the boys came to the street, singing their song, ""Storks, storks, fly home and rest."" ",5640,5732
93,"""Shall we fly down and peck them?"" ",5732,5767
94,asked the young ones. ,5767,5789
95,"""No, leave them alone. ",5789,5812
96,Attend to me; ,5812,5826
97, that's far more important. ,5825,5853
98,One--two--three! ,5853,5870
99,now we fly round to the right. ,5870,5901
100,One--two--three! ,5853,5870
101,"now to the left, round the chimney. ",5918,5954
102,There! ,5954,5961
103,that was very good. ,5961,5981
104,That last flap with your wings and the kick with your feet were so graceful and proper that to-morrow you shall fly with me to the marsh. ,5981,6119
105,Several of the nicest stork families will be there with their children. ,6119,6191
106,Let me see that mine are the best bred of all. ,6191,6238
107,"Carry your heads high and mind you strut about proudly, for that looks well and helps to make one respected."" ",6238,6348
108,"""But shall we not take revenge upon the naughty boys?"" ",6348,6403
109,asked the young storks. ,2095,2119
110,"""No, no; ",2119,2128
111," let them scream away, as much as they please. ",6435,6482
112,"You are to fly up to the clouds and away to the land of the pyramids, while they are freezing and can neither see a green leaf nor taste a sweet apple."" ",6482,6635
113,"""But we will revenge ourselves,"" they whispered one to another. ",6635,6699
114,And then the training began again. ,6699,6734
115,"Among all the children down in the street the one that seemed most bent upon singing the song that made game of the storks was the boy who had begun it, and he was a little fellow hardly more than six years old. ",6734,6946
116,"The young storks, to be sure, thought he was at least a hundred, for he was much bigger than their parents, and, besides, what did they know about the ages of either children or grown men? ",6946,7135
117,Their whole vengeance was to be aimed at this one boy. ,7135,7190
118,It was always he who began the song and persisted in mocking them. ,7190,7257
119,"The young storks were very angry, and as they grew larger they also grew less patient under insult, and their mother was at last obliged to promise them that they might be revenged--but not until the day of their departure. ",7257,7481
120,"""We must first see how you carry yourselves at the great review. ",7481,7546
121,"If you do so badly that the general runs his beak through you, then the boys will be in the right--at least in one way. ",7546,7666
122,"We must wait and see!"" ",7666,7689
123,"""Yes, you shall see!"" ",7689,7711
124,cried all the young storks; ,7711,7739
125," and they took the greatest pains, practicing every day, until they flew so evenly and so lightly that it was a pleasure to see them. ",7738,7872
126,The autumn now set in; ,7872,7895
127," all the storks began to assemble, in order to start for the warm countries and leave winter behind them. ",7894,8000
128,And such exercises as there were! ,8000,8034
129,"Young fledglings were set to fly over forests and villages, to see if they were equal to the long journey that was before them. ",8034,8162
130,"So well did our young storks acquit themselves, that, as a proof of the satisfaction they had given, the mark they got was, ""Remarkably well,"" with a present of a frog and a snake, which they lost no time in eating. ",8162,8378
131,"""Now,"" said they, ""we will be revenged."" ",8378,8419
132,"""Yes, certainly,"" said their mother; ",8419,8456
133," ""and I have thought of a way that will surely be the fairest. ",8455,8518
134,I know a pond where all the little human children lie till the stork comes to take them to their parents. ,8518,8624
135,"There lie the pretty little babies, dreaming more sweetly than they ever dream afterwards. ",8624,8715
136,"All the parents are wishing for one of these little ones, and the children all want a sister or a brother. ",8715,8822
137,"Now we'll fly to the pond and bring back a baby for every child who did not sing the naughty song that made game of the storks."" ",8822,8951
138,"""But the very naughty boy who was the first to begin the song,"" cried the young storks, ""what shall we do with him?"" ",8951,9068
139,"""There is a little dead child in the pond--one that has dreamed itself to death. ",9068,9149
140,We will bring that for him. ,9149,9177
141,Then he will cry because we have brought a little dead brother to him. ,9177,9248
142,"""But that good boy,--you have not forgotten him!--the one who said it was a shame to mock at the animals; ",9248,9354
143, for him we will bring both a brother and a sister. ,9353,9405
144,"And because his name is Peter, all of you shall be called Peter, too."" ",9405,9476
145,All was done as the mother had said; ,9476,9513
146," the storks were named Peter, and so they are called to this day.",9512,9578
