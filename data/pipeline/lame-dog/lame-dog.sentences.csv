0,"Once upon a time there lived a king, like many others. ",0,55
1,"He had three daughters, who were young and beautiful to such a degree that it would have been difficult to have found handsomer maidens. ",55,192
2,Yet there was a great difference among them; ,192,237
3, for the two older sisters were haughty in their thoughts and manners; ,236,307
4," while the youngest was sweet and friendly, and everyone liked her. ",306,374
5,"Besides, she was fair as the day and delicate as the snow, and far more beautiful than either of her sisters. ",374,484
6,"One day the king's daughters were sitting together in their room, and their talk happened to turn on their husbands-to-be. ",484,607
7,"The oldest said: ""If I ever marry, my husband must have golden hair and a a golden beard!"" ",607,698
8,"And the second exclaimed: ""And mine must have silver hair and a silver beard!"" ",698,777
9,But the youngest princess held her tongue and said nothing. ,777,837
10,Then her sisters asked her whether she did not want to wish for a husband. ,837,912
11,"""No,"" she answered, ""but if fate should give me a husband, I will be content to take him as he is, and were he no more than a lame dog."" ",912,1049
12,"Then the two other princesses laughed and joked about it, and told her the day might easily come when she would change her mind. ",1049,1178
13,But many speak truth and do not know it! ,1178,1219
14,Thus it chanced with the king's daughters; ,1219,1262
15," since before the year had come to an end, each had the suitor for whom she had wished. ",1261,1349
16,A man with golden hair and golden beard sued for the oldest princess and won her consent to his suit. ,1349,1451
17,And a man with silver hair and a silver beard sued for the second and she became his bride; ,1451,1543
18, but the youngest princess had no other suitor than a lame dog. ,1542,1606
19,"Then she recalled her talk with her sisters in their room, and thought to herself: ""May God aid me in the marriage into which I must enter!"" ",1606,1747
20,Yet she would not break the word she had once passed; ,1747,1801
21, but followed her sisters' example and accepted the dog. ,1800,1857
22,The wedding lasted a number of days and was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. ,1857,1942
23,"But while the guests danced and amused themselves, the youngest princess sat apart and wept, and when the others were laughing, her tears flowed till it made one sad to see them. ",1942,2121
24,After the wedding the newly married pairs were each to drive off to their castle. ,2121,2203
25,"And the two older princesses each drove off in a splendidly decorated coach, with a large retinue, and all sorts of honors. ",2203,2327
26,"But the youngest had to go afoot, since her husband, the dog, had neither coach nor driver. ",2327,2419
27,"When they had wandered long and far, they came to a great forest, so great that it seemed endless; ",2419,2518
28," but the dog limped along in advance, and the king's daughter followed after, weeping. ",2517,2604
29,"And as they went along she suddenly saw a magnificent castle lying before them, and round about it were beautiful meadows and green woods, all of them most enjoyable to see. ",2604,2778
30,The princess stopped and asked to whom the great mansion might belong. ,2778,2849
31,"""That,"" said the dog, ""is our home. ",2849,2885
32,"We will live here, and you shall rule it as you see fit."" ",2885,2943
33,"Then the maiden laughed amid her tears, and could not overcome her surprise at all she saw. ",2943,3035
34,"The dog added: ""I have but a single request to make to you, and that you must not refuse to grant."" ",3035,3135
35,"""What is your request?"" ",3135,3159
36,asked the princess. ,3159,3179
37,"""You must promise me,"" said the dog, ""that you will never look at me while I am asleep: otherwise you are free to do whatever you wish."" ",3179,3316
38,"The princess gladly promised to grant his request, and so they went to the great castle. ",3316,3405
39,"And if the castle was magnificent from without, it was still more magnificent within. ",3405,3491
40,It was so full of gold and silver that the precious metals gleamed from every corner; ,3491,3577
41," and there was such abundance of supplies of every kind, and of so many other things, that everything in the world one might have wished to have was already there. ",3576,3740
42,"The princess spent the live-long day running from one room to another, and each was handsomer than the one she had just entered. ",3740,3869
43,"But when evening came and she went to bed, the dog crept into his own, and then she noticed that he was not a dog; ",3869,3984
44, but a human being. ,3983,4003
45,"Yet she said not a word, because she remembered her promise, and did not wish to cross her husband's will. ",4003,4110
46,Thus some time passed. ,4110,4133
47,"The princess dwelt in the beautiful castle, and had everything her heart might desire. ",4133,4220
48,"But every day the dog ran off, and did not reappear until it was evening and the sun had set. ",4220,4314
49,"Then he returned home, and was always so kind and friendly that it would have been a fine thing had other men done half as well. ",4314,4443
50,"The princess now began to feel a great affection for him, and quite forgot he was only a lame dog; ",4443,4542
51," for the proverb says: ""Love is blind."" ",4541,4581
52,"Yet time passed slowly because she was so much alone, and she often thought of visiting her sisters and seeing how they were. ",4581,4707
53,"She spoke of it to her husband, and begged his permission to make the journey. ",4707,4786
54,"No sooner had the dog heard her wish than he at once granted it, and even accompanied her some distance, in order to show her the way out of the wood. ",4786,4937
55,"When the king's daughters were once reunited, they were naturally very happy, and there were a great many questions asked about matters old and new. ",4937,5086
56,And marriage was also discussed. ,5086,5119
57,"The oldest princess said: ""It was silly of me to wish for a husband with golden hair and golden beard; ",5119,5222
58," for mine is worse than the veriest troll, and I have not known a happy day since we married."" ",5221,5316
59,"And the second went on: ""Yes, and I am no better off; ",5316,5370
60," for although I have a husband with silver hair and a silver beard, he dislikes me so heartily that he begrudges me a single hour of happiness."" ",5369,5514
61,Then her sisters turned to the youngest princess and asked how she fared. ,5514,5588
62,"""Well,"" was her answer, ""I really cannot complain; ",5588,5639
63," for though I only got a lame dog, he is such a dear good fellow and so kind to me that it would be hard to find a better husband."" ",5638,5770
64,"The other princesses were much surprised to hear this, and did not stop prying and questioning, and their sister answered all their questions faithfully. ",5770,5924
65,"When they heard how splendidly she lived in the great castle, they grew jealous because she was so much better off than they were. ",5924,6055
66,And they insisted on knowing whether there was not some one little thing of which she could complain. ,6055,6157
67,"""No,"" said the king's daughter, ""I can only praise my husband for his kindness and amiability, and there is but one thing lacking to make me perfectly happy."" ",6157,6316
68,"""What is it?"" ",6316,6330
69,"""What is it?"" ",6316,6330
70,cried both sisters with a single voice. ,6344,6384
71,"""Every night, when he comes home,"" said the princess, ""he turns into a human being, and I am sorry that I can never see what he really looks like."" ",6384,6532
72,"Then both sisters again with one voice, began to scold the dog loudly; ",6532,6603
73, because he had a secret which he kept from his wife. ,6602,6656
74,"And since her sisters now continually spoke about it, her own curiosity awoke once more, she forgot her husband's command, and asked how she might manage to see him without his knowing it. ",6656,6845
75,"""O,"" said the oldest princess, ""nothing easier! ",6845,6893
76,"Here is a little lamp, which you must hide carefully. ",6893,6947
77,"Then you need only get up at night when he is asleep, and light the lamp in order to see him in his true shape."" ",6947,7060
78,This advice seemed good to the king's daughter; ,7060,7108
79," she took the lamp, hid it in her breast, and promised to do all that her sisters had counseled. ",7107,7204
80,"When the time came for them to part, the youngest princess went back to her beautiful castle. ",7204,7298
81,The day passed like every other day. ,7298,7335
82,"When evening came at last and the dog had gone to bed, the princess was so driven by curiosity that she could hardly wait until he had fallen asleep. ",7335,7485
83,"Then she rose, softly, lit her lamp, and drew near the bed to look at him while he slept. ",7485,7575
84,"But no one can describe her astonishment when throwing the light on the bed, she saw no lame dog lying there; ",7575,7685
85, but the handsomest youth her eyes had ever beheld. ,7684,7736
86,She could not stop looking at him; ,7736,7771
87," but sat up all night bending over his pillow, and the more she looked at him the handsomer he seemed to grow, until she forgot everything else in the world. ",7770,7928
88,At last the morning came. ,7928,7954
89,"And as the first star began to pale in the dawn, the youth began to grow restless and awaken. ",7954,8048
90,"The princess much frightened, blew out her lamp and lay down in her bed. ",8048,8121
91,"The youth thought she was sleeping and did not wish to wake her, so he rose quietly, assumed his other shape, went away and did not appear again all day long. ",8121,8280
92,"And when evening came and it grew late, everything happened as before. ",8280,8351
93,The dog came home from the forest and was very tired. ,8351,8405
94,"But no sooner had he fallen asleep than the princess rose carefully, lit her lamp and came over to look at him. ",8405,8517
95,"And when she cast the light on his bed it seemed to her as though the youth had grown even handsomer than the day before, and the longer she looked the more handsome he became; ",8517,8694
96, until she had to laugh and weep from sheer love and longing. ,8693,8755
97,"She could not take her eyes from him, and sat all night long bent over his pillow, forgetful of her promise and all else, only to be able to look at him. ",8755,8909
98,With the first ray of dawn the youth began to stir and awake. ,8909,8971
99,"Then the princess was again frightened, quickly blew out her lamp and lay down in her bed. ",8971,9062
100,"The youth thought she was sleeping, and not wishing to waken her, rose softly, assumed his other shape, went away and was gone for the entire day. ",9062,9209
101,"At length it grew late again, evening came and the dog returned home from the forest as usual. ",9209,9304
102,But again the princess could not control her curiosity; ,9304,9360
103," no sooner was her husband sleeping than she rose quietly, lit her lamp, and drew near carefully in order to look at him while he slept. ",9359,9496
104,"And when the light fell on the youth, he appeared to be handsomer than ever before, and the longer she looked the more handsome he grew, until her heart burned in her breast, and she forgot all else in the world looking at him. ",9496,9724
105,"She could not take her eyes from him, and sat up all night bending over his pillow. ",9724,9808
106,"And when morning came and the sun rose, the youth began to move and awaken. ",9808,9884
107,"Then the princess was much frightened, because she had paid no heed to the passing of time, and she tried to put out her lamp quickly. ",9884,10019
108,"But her hand trembled, and a warm drop of oil fell on the youth and he awoke. ",10019,10097
109,"When he saw what she had done, he leaped up, terrified, instantly turned into a lame dog, and limped out into the forest. ",10097,10219
110,"But the princess felt so remorseful that she nearly lost her senses, and she ran after him, wringing her hands and weeping bitterly, and begging him to return. ",10219,10379
111,But he did not come back. ,10379,10405
112,"The king's daughter now wandered over hill and dale, along many a road new to her, in order to find her husband, and her tears flowed the while till it would have moved a stone. ",10405,10583
113,"But the dog was gone and stayed gone, though she looked for him North and South. ",10583,10664
114,"When she saw that she could not find him, she thought she would return to her handsome castle. ",10664,10759
115,But there she was just as unfortunate. ,10759,10798
116,"The castle was nowhere to be seen, and wherever she went she was surrounded by a forest black as coal. ",10798,10901
117,"Then she came to the conclusion that the whole world had abandoned her, sat down on a stone, wept bitterly, and thought how much rather she would die than live without her husband. ",10901,11082
118,"At that a little toad hopped out from under the stone, and said: ""Lovely maiden, why do you sit here and weep?"" ",11082,11194
119,"And the princess answered: ""It is my hard fate to weep and never be happy again. ",11194,11275
120,"First of all I have lost the love of my heart, and now I can no longer find my way back to the castle. ",11275,11378
121,"So I must perish of hunger here, or else be devoured by wild beasts."" ",11378,11448
122,"""O,"" said the toad, ""if that is all that troubles you, I can help you! ",11448,11519
123,"If you will promise to be my dearest friend, I will show you the way."" ",11519,11590
124,But that the princess did not want to do. ,11590,11632
125,"She replied: ""Ask of me what you will, save that alone. ",11632,11688
126,"I have never loved any one more than my lame dog, and so long as I live will never love any one else better."" ",11688,11798
127,"With that she rose, wept bitterly, and continued her way. ",11798,11856
128,"But the toad looked after her in a friendly manner, laughed to himself, and once more crept under his stone. ",11856,11965
129,"After the king's daughter had wandered on for a long, long way, and still saw nothing but forest and wilderness, she grew very tired. ",11965,12099
130,"She once more sat down on a stone, rested her chin on her hand, and prayed for death, since it was no longer possible for her to live with her husband. ",12099,12251
131,"Suddenly there was a rustling in the bushes, and she saw a big gray wolf coming directly toward her. ",12251,12352
132,"She was much frightened, since her one thought was that the wolf intended to devour her. ",12352,12441
133,"But the wolf stopped, wagged his tail, and said: ""Proud maiden, why do you sit here and weep so bitterly?"" ",12441,12548
134,"The princess answered: ""It is my hard fate to weep and never be happy again. ",12548,12625
135,"First of all I have lost my heart's dearest, and now I cannot find my way back to the castle and must perish of hunger, or be devoured by wild beasts."" ",12625,12777
136,"""O,"" said the wolf, ""if that is all that troubles you, I can help you! ",12777,12848
137,"Let me be your best friend and I will show you the way."" ",12848,12905
138,"But that did not suit the princess, and she replied: ""Ask of me what you will, save that alone. ",12905,13001
139,"I have never loved any one more than my lame dog, and so long as I live I will never love any one else better."" ",13001,13113
140,"With that she rose, weeping bitterly, and continued on her way. ",13113,13177
141,"But the wolf looked after her in a friendly manner, laughed to himself and ran off hastily. ",13177,13269
142,"After the princess had once more wandered for a long time in the wilderness, she was again so wearied and exhausted that she could not go on. ",13269,13411
143,"She sat down on a stone, wrung her hands, and wished for death, since she could no longer live with her husband. ",13411,13524
144,"At that moment she heard a hollow roaring that made the earth tremble, and a monstrous big lion appeared and came directly toward her. ",13524,13659
145,Now she was much frightened; ,13659,13688
146, for what else could she think but that the lion would tear her to pieces? ,13687,13762
147,"But the beast was so weighed down with heavy iron chains that he could scarcely drag himself along, and the chains clashed at either side when he moved. ",13762,13915
148,"When the lion finally reached the princess he stopped, wagged his tail, and asked: ""Beautiful maiden, why do you sit here and weep so bitterly?"" ",13915,14060
149,"The princess answered: ""It is my hard fate to weep and never be happy again. ",12548,12625
150,"First of all I have lost my heart's dearest, and now I cannot find my way to the castle, and must perish of hunger, or be devoured by wild beasts."" ",14137,14285
151,"""O,"" said the lion, ""if that is all that troubles you, I can help you! ",14285,14356
152,"If you will loose my chains and make me your best friend, I will show you the way."" ",14356,14440
153,"But the princess was so terrified that she could not answer the lion, far less venture to draw near him. ",14440,14545
154,"Then she heard a clear voice sounding from the forest: it was a little nightingale, who sat among the branches and sang: ""Maiden, maiden, loose his chains!"" ",14545,14702
155,"Then she felt sorry for the lion, grew braver, went up to him, unloosed his chains and said: ""Your chains I can loose for you; ",14702,14829
156, but I can never be your best friend. ,14828,14866
157,"For I have never loved any one more than my lame dog and will never love any one else better."" ",14866,14961
158,"And then a wondrous thing took place: at the very moment the last chain fell from him, the lion turned into a handsome young prince, and when the princess looked at him more closely, it was none other than her heart's dearest, who before had been a dog. ",14961,15215
159,"She sank to the ground, clasped his knees, and begged him not to leave her again. ",15215,15297
160,"But the prince raised her with deep affection, took her in his arms and said: ""No, now we shall never more be parted, for I am released from my enchantment, and have proved your faith toward me in every way.""",15297,15506
