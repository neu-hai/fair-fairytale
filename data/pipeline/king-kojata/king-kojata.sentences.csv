0,"There was once upon a time a king called Kojata, whose beard was so long that it reached below his knees. ",0,106
1,"Three years had passed since his marriage, and he lived very happily with his wife, but Heaven granted him no heir, which grieved the King greatly. ",106,254
2,"One day he set forth from his capital, in order to make a journey through his kingdom. ",254,341
3,"He travelled for nearly a year through the different parts of his territory, and then, having seen all there was to be seen, he set forth on his homeward way. ",341,500
4,"As the day was very hot and sultry he commanded his servants to pitch tents in the open field, and there await the cool of the evening. ",500,636
5,"Suddenly a frightful thirst seized the King, and as he saw no water near, he mounted his horse, and rode through the neighbourhood looking for a spring. ",636,789
6,"Before long he came to a well filled to the brim with water clear as crystal, and on the bosom of which a golden jug was floating. ",789,920
7,"King Kojata at once tried to seize the vessel, but though he endeavoured to grasp it with his right hand, and then with his left, the wretched thing always eluded his efforts and refused to let itself be caught. ",920,1132
8,"First with one hand, and then with two, did the King try to seize it, but like a fish the goblet always slipped through his fingers and bobbed to the ground only to reappear at some other place, and mock the King. ",1132,1346
9,'Plague on you!' ,1346,1363
10,said King Kojata. ,1363,1381
11,"'I can quench my thirst without you,' and bending over the well he lapped up the water so greedily that he plunged his face, beard and all, right into the crystal mirror. ",1381,1552
12,"But when he had satisfied his thirst, and wished to raise himself up, he couldn't lift his head, because someone held his beard fast in the water. ",1552,1699
13,'Who's there? ,1699,1713
14,let me go!' ,1713,1725
15,"cried King Kojata, but there was no answer; ",1725,1769
16," only an awful face looked up from the bottom of the well with two great green eyes, glowing like emeralds, and a wide mouth reaching from ear to ear showing two rows of gleaming white teeth, and the King's beard was held, not by mortal hands, but by two claws. ",1768,2030
17,At last a hoarse voice sounded from the depths. ,2030,2078
18,"'Your trouble is all in vain, King Kojata; ",2078,2121
19," I will only let you go on condition that you give me something you know nothing about, and which you will find on your return home.' ",2120,2254
20,"The King didn't pause to ponder long, 'for what,' thought he, 'could be in my palace without my knowing about it--the thing is absurd;'",2254,2389
21,"' so he answered quickly: 'Yes, I promise that you shall have it.' ",2388,2455
22,"The voice replied, 'Very well; ",2455,2486
23, but it will go ill with you if you fail to keep your promise.' ,2485,2549
24,"Then the claws relaxed their hold, and the face disappeared in the depths. ",2549,2624
25,"The King drew his chin out of the water, and shook himself like a dog; ",2624,2695
26, then he mounted his horse and rode thoughtfully home with his retinue. ,2694,2766
27,"When they approached the capital, all the people came out to meet them with great joy and acclamation, and when the King reached his palace the Queen met him on the threshold; ",2766,2942
28," beside her stood the Prime Minister, holding a little cradle in his hands, in which lay a new-born child as beautiful as the day. ",2941,3072
29,"Then the whole thing dawned on the King, and groaning deeply he muttered to himself 'So this is what I did not know about,' and the tears rolled down his cheeks. ",3072,3234
30,"All the courtiers standing round were much amazed at the King's grief, but no one dared to ask him the cause of it. ",3234,3350
31,He took the child in his arms and kissed it tenderly; ,3350,3404
32," then laying it in its cradle, he determined to control his emotion and began to reign again as before. ",3403,3507
33,"The secret of the King remained a secret, though his grave, careworn expression escaped no one's notice. ",3507,3612
34,"In the constant dread that his child would be taken from him, poor Kojata knew no rest night or day. ",3612,3713
35,"However, time went on and nothing happened. ",3713,3757
36,"Days and months and years passed, and the Prince grew up into a beautiful youth, and at last the King himself forgot all about the incident that had happened so long ago. ",3757,3928
37,"One day the Prince went out hunting, and going in pursuit of a wild boar he soon lost the other huntsmen, and found himself quite alone in the middle of a dark wood. ",3928,4094
38,"The trees grew so thick and near together that it was almost impossible to see through them, only straight in front of him lay a little patch of meadowland. ",4094,4251
39,"Overgrown with thistles and rank weeds, in the centre of which a leafy lime tree reared itself. ",4251,4347
40,"Suddenly a rustling sound was heard in the hollow of the tree, and an extraordinary old man with green eyes and chin crept out of it. ",4347,4481
41,"'A fine day, Prince Milan,' he said; ",4481,4518
42, 'you've kept me waiting a good number of years; ,4517,4566
43, it was high time for you to come and pay me a visit.' ,4565,4620
44,"'Who are you, in the name of wonder?' ",4620,4658
45,demanded the astonished Prince. ,4658,4690
46,"'You'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime do as I bid you. ",4690,4757
47,"Greet your father King Kojata from me, and don't forget to remind him of his debt; ",4757,4840
48," the time has long passed since it was due, but now he will have to pay it. ",4839,4915
49,Farewell for the present; ,4915,4941
50, we shall meet again.' ,4940,4963
51,"With these words the old man disappeared into the tree, and the Prince returned home rather startled, and told his father all that he had seen and heard. ",4963,5117
52,"The King grew as white as a sheet when he heard the Prince's story, and said, 'Woe is me, my son! ",5117,5215
53,"The time has come when we must part,' and with a heavy heart he told the Prince what had happened at the time of his birth. ",5215,5339
54,"'Don't worry or distress yourself, dear father,' answered Prince Milan. ",5339,5411
55,'Things are never as bad as they look. ,5411,5450
56,"Only give me a horse for my journey, and I wager you'll soon see me back again.' ",5450,5531
57,"The King gave him a beautiful charger, with golden stirrups, and a sword. ",5531,5605
58,"The Queen hung a little cross round his neck, and after much weeping and lamentation the Prince bade them all farewell and set forth on his journey. ",5605,5754
59,"He rode straight on for two days, and on the third he came to a lake as smooth as glass and as clear as crystal. ",5754,5867
60,"Not a breath of wind moved, not a leaf stirred, all was silent as the grave, only on the still bosom of the lake thirty ducks, with brilliant plumage, swam about in the water. ",5867,6043
61,"Not far from the shore Prince Milan noticed thirty little white garments lying on the grass, and dismounting from his horse, he crept down under the high bulrushes, took one of the garments and hid himself with it behind the bushes which grew round the lake. ",6043,6302
62,"The ducks swam about all over the place, dived down into the depths and rose again and glided through the waves. ",6302,6415
63,"At last, tired of disporting themselves, they swam to the shore, and twenty-nine of them put on their little white garments and instantly turned into so many beautiful maidens. ",6415,6592
64,Then they finished dressing and disappeared. ,6592,6637
65,Only the thirtieth little duck couldn't come to the land; ,6637,6695
66," it swam about close to the shore, and, giving out a piercing cry, it stretched its neck up timidly, gazed wildly around, and then dived under again. ",6694,6844
67,"Prince Milan's heart was so moved with pity for the poor little creature that he came out from behind the bulrushes, to see if he could be of any help. ",6844,6996
68,"As soon as the duck perceived him, it cried in a human voice, 'Oh, dear Prince Milan, for the love of Heaven give me back my garment, and I will be so grateful to you.' ",6996,7165
69,"The Prince lay the little garment on the bank beside her, and stepped back into the bushes. ",7165,7257
70,"In a few seconds a beautiful girl in a white robe stood before him, so fair and sweet and young that no pen could describe her. ",7257,7385
71,She gave the Prince her hand and spoke. ,7385,7425
72,"'Many thanks, Prince Milan, for your courtesy. ",7425,7472
73,"I am the daughter of a wicked magician, and my name is Hyacinthia. ",7472,7539
74,"My father has thirty young daughters, and is a mighty ruler in the underworld, with many castles and great riches. ",7539,7654
75,"He has been expecting you for ages, but you need have no fear if you will only follow my advice. ",7654,7751
76,"As soon as you come into the presence of my father, throw yourself at once on the ground and approach him on your knees. ",7751,7872
77,Don't mind if he stamps furiously with his feet and curses and swears. ,7872,7943
78,"I'll attend to the rest, and in the meantime we had better be off.' ",7943,8011
79,"With these words the beautiful Hyacinthia stamped on the ground with her little foot, and the earth opened and they both sank down into the lower world. ",8011,8164
80,"The palace of the Magician was all hewn out of a single carbuncle, lighting up the whole surrounding region, and Prince Milan walked into it gaily. ",8164,8312
81,"The Magician sat on a throne, a sparkling crown on his head; ",8312,8373
82," his eyes blazed like a green fire, and instead of hands he had claws. ",8372,8443
83,As soon as Prince Milan entered he flung himself on his knees. ,8443,8506
84,"The Magician stamped loudly with his feet, glared frightfully out of his green eyes, and cursed so loudly that the whole underworld shook. ",8506,8645
85,"But the Prince, mindful of the counsel he had been given, wasn't the least afraid, and approached the throne still on his knees. ",8645,8774
86,"At last the Magician laughed aloud and said, 'You rogue, you have been well advised to make me laugh; ",8774,8876
87, I won't be your enemy any more. ,8875,8908
88,Welcome to the underworld! ,8908,8935
89,"All the same, for your delay in coming here, we must demand three services from you. ",8935,9020
90,"For to-day you may go, but to-morrow I shall have something more to say to you.' ",9020,9101
91,"Then two servants led Prince Milan to a beautiful apartment, and he lay down fearlessly on the soft bed that had been prepared for him, and was soon fast asleep. ",9101,9263
92,"Early the next morning the Magician sent for him, and said, 'Let's see now what you've learnt. ",9263,9358
93,"In the first place you must build me a palace to-night, the roof of purest gold, the walls of marble, and the windows of crystal; ",9358,9488
94," all round you must lay out a beautiful garden, with fish-ponds and artistic waterfalls. ",9487,9576
95,"If you do all this, I will reward you richly; ",9576,9622
96," but if you don't, you shall lose your head.' ",9621,9667
97,"'Oh, you wicked monster!' ",9667,9693
98,"thought Prince Milan, 'you might as well have put me to death at once.' ",9693,9765
99,"Sadly he returned to his room, and with bent head sat brooding over his cruel fate till evening. ",9765,9862
100,"When it grew dark, a little bee flew by, and knocking at the window, it said, 'Open, and let me in.' ",9862,9963
101,"Milan opened the window quickly, and as soon as the bee had entered, it changed into the beautiful Hyacinthia. ",9963,10074
102,"'Good evening, Prince Milan. ",10074,10103
103,Why are you so sad?' ,10103,10124
104,'How can I help being sad? ,10124,10151
105,"Your father threatens me with death, and I see myself already without a head.' ",10151,10230
106,'And what have you made up your mind to do?' ,10230,10275
107,"'There's nothing to be done, and after all I suppose one can only die once.' ",10275,10352
108,"'Now, don't be so foolish, my dear Prince; ",10352,10395
109," but keep up your spirits, for there is no need to despair. ",10394,10454
110,"Go to bed, and when you wake up to-morrow morning the palace will be finished. ",10454,10533
111,"Then you must go all round it, giving a tap here and there on the walls to look as if you had just finished it.' ",10533,10646
112,And so it all turned out just as she had said. ,10646,10693
113,"As soon as it was daylight Prince Milan stepped out of his room, and found a palace which was quite a work of art down to the very smallest detail. ",10693,10841
114,"The Magician himself was not a little astonished at its beauty, and could hardly believe his eyes. ",10841,10940
115,"'Well, you certainly are a splendid workman,' he said to the Prince. ",10940,11009
116,"'I see you are very clever with your hands, now I must see if you are equally accomplished with your head. ",11009,11116
117,"I have thirty daughters in my house, all beautiful princesses. ",11116,11179
118,To-morrow I will place the whole thirty in a row. ,11179,11229
119,"You must walk past them three times, and the third time you must show me which is my youngest daughter Hyacinthia. ",11229,11344
120,"If you don't guess rightly, you shall lose your head.' ",11344,11399
121,"'This time you've made a mistake,' thought Prince Milan, and going to his room he sat down at the window. ",11399,11505
122,'Just fancy my not recognising the beautiful Hyacinthia! ,11505,11562
123,"Why, that is the easiest thing in the world.' ",11562,11608
124,"'Not so easy as you think,' cried the little bee, who was flying past. ",11608,11679
125,"'If I weren't to help you, you'd never guess. ",11679,11725
126,We are thirty sisters so exactly alike that our own father can hardly distinguish us apart.' ,11725,11818
127,'Then what am I to do?' ,11818,11842
128,asked Prince Milan. ,11842,11862
129,"'Listen,' answered Hyacinthia. ",11862,11893
130,"'You will recognise me by a tiny fly I shall have on my left cheek, but be careful for you might easily make a mistake.' ",11893,12014
131,The next day the Magician again commanded Prince Milan to be led before him. ,12014,12091
132,"His daughters were all arranged in a straight row in front of him, dressed exactly alike, and with their eyes bent on the ground. ",12091,12221
133,"'Now, you genius,' said the Magician, 'look at these beauties three times, and then tell us which is the Princess Hyacinthia.' ",12221,12348
134,Prince Milan went past them and looked at them closely. ,12348,12404
135,"But they were all so precisely alike that they looked like one face reflected in thirty mirrors, and the fly was nowhere to be seen; ",12404,12537
136, the second time he passed them he still saw nothing; ,12536,12590
137," but the third time he perceived a little fly stealing down one cheek, causing it to blush a faint pink. ",12589,12694
138,"Then the Prince seized the girl's hand and cried out, 'This is the Princess Hyacinthia!' ",12694,12783
139,"'You're right again,' said the Magician in amazement; ",12783,12837
140, 'but I've still another task for you to do. ,12836,12881
141,"Before this candle, which I shall light, burns to the socket, you must have made me a pair of boots reaching to my knees. ",12881,13003
142,"If they aren't finished in that time, off comes your head.' ",13003,13063
143,The Prince returned to his room in despair; ,13063,13107
144," then the Princess Hyacinthia came to him once more changed into the likeness of a bee, and asked him, 'Why so sad, Prince Milan?' ",13106,13237
145,'How can I help being sad? ,10124,10151
146,Your father has set me this time an impossible task. ,13264,13317
147,"Before a candle which he has lit burns to the socket, I am to make a pair of boots. ",13317,13401
148,But what does a prince know of shoemaking? ,13401,13444
149,"If I can't do it, I lose my head.' ",13444,13479
150,'And what do you mean to do?' ,13479,13509
151,asked Hyacinthia. ,13509,13527
152,"'Well, what is there to be done? ",13527,13560
153,"What he demands I can't and won't do, so he must just make an end of me.' ",13560,13634
154,"'Not so, dearest. ",13634,13652
155,"I love you dearly, and you shall marry me, and I'll either save your life or die with you. ",13652,13743
156,"We must fly now as quickly as we can, for there is no other way of escape.' ",13743,13819
157,"With these words she breathed on the window, and her breath froze on the pane. ",13819,13898
158,"Then she led Milan out of the room with her, shut the door, and threw the key away. ",13898,13982
159,"Hand in hand, they hurried to the spot where they had descended into the lower world, and at last reached the banks of the lake. ",13982,14111
160,Prince Milan's charger was still grazing on the grass which grew near the water. ,14111,14192
161,"The horse no sooner recognized his master, than it neighed loudly with joy, and springing towards him, it stood as if rooted to the ground, while Prince Milan and Hyacinthia jumped on its back. ",14192,14386
162,Then it sped onwards like an arrow from a bow. ,14386,14433
163,In the meantime the Magician was waiting impatiently for the Prince. ,14433,14502
164,"Enraged by the delay, he sent his servants to fetch him, for the appointed time was past. ",14502,14592
165,"The servants came to the door, and finding it locked, they knocked; ",14592,14660
166," but the frozen breath on the window replied in Prince Milan's voice, 'I am coming directly.' ",14659,14753
167,With this answer they returned to the Magician. ,14753,14801
168,"But when the Prince still did not appear, after a time he sent his servants a second time to bring him. ",14801,14905
169,"The frozen breath always gave the same answer, but the Prince never came. ",14905,14979
170,"At last the Magician lost all patience, and commanded the door to be burst open. ",14979,15060
171,"But when his servants did so, they found the room empty, and the frozen breath laughed aloud. ",15060,15154
172,"Out of his mind with rage, the Magician ordered the Prince to be pursued. ",15154,15228
173,Then a wild chase began. ,15228,15253
174,"'I hear horses' hoofs behind us,' said Hyacinthia to the Prince. ",15253,15318
175,"Milan sprang from the saddle, put his ear to the ground and listened. ",15318,15388
176,"'Yes,' he answered, 'they are pursuing us, and are quite close.' ",15388,15453
177,"'Then no time must be lost,' said Hyacinthia, and she immediately turned herself into a river, Prince Milan into an iron bridge, and the charger into a blackbird. ",15453,15616
178,Behind the bridge the road branched off into three ways. ,15616,15673
179,"The Magician's servants hurried after the fresh tracks, but when they came to the bridge, they stood, not knowing which road to take, as the footprints stopped suddenly, and there were three paths for them to choose from. ",15673,15895
180,In fear and trembling they returned to tell the Magician what had happened. ,15895,15971
181,"He flew into a dreadful rage when he saw them, and screamed out, 'Oh, you fools! ",15971,16052
182,the river and bridge were they! ,16052,16084
183,"Go back and bring them to me at once, or it will be the worse for you.' ",16084,16156
184,Then the pursuit began afresh. ,16156,16187
185,"'I hear horses' hoofs,' sighed Hyacinthia. ",16187,16230
186,The Prince dismounted and put his ear to the ground. ,16230,16283
187,"'They are hurrying after us, and are already quite near.' ",16283,16341
188,"In a moment the Princess Hyacinthia had changed herself, the Prince, and his charger into a thick wood where a thousand paths and roads crossed each other. ",16341,16497
189,"Their pursuers entered the forest, but searched in vain for Prince Milan and his bride. ",16497,16585
190,"At last they found themselves back at the same spot they had started from, and in despair they returned once more with empty hands to the Magician. ",16585,16733
191,"'Then I'll go after the wretches myself,' he shouted. ",16733,16787
192,'Bring a horse at once; ,16787,16811
193, they shan't escape me.' ,16810,16835
194,"Once more the beautiful Hyacinthia murmured, 'I hear horses' hoofs quite near.' ",16835,16915
195,"And the Prince answered, 'They are pursuing us hotly and are quite close.' ",16915,16990
196,"'We are lost now, for that is my father himself. ",16990,17039
197,But at the first church we come to his power ceases; ,17039,17092
198, he may chase us no further. ,17091,17120
199,Hand me your cross.' ,17120,17141
200,"Prince Milan loosened from his neck the little gold cross his mother had given him, and as soon as Hyacinthia grasped it, she had changed herself into a church, Milan into a monk, and the horse into a belfry. ",17141,17350
201,They had hardly done this when the magician and his servants rode up. ,17350,17420
202,"'Did you see no one pass by on horseback, reverend father?' ",17420,17480
203,he asked the monk. ,17480,17499
204,'Prince Milan and Princess Hyacinthia have just gone on this minute; ,17499,17568
205," they stopped for a few minutes in the church to say their prayers, and bade me light this wax candle for you, and give you their love.' ",17567,17704
206,"'I'd like to wring their necks,' said the magician, and made all haste home, where he had every one of his servants beaten to within an inch of their lives. ",17704,17861
207,Prince Milan rode on slowly with his bride without fearing any further pursuit. ,17861,17941
208,"The sun was just setting, and its last rays lit up a large city they were approaching. ",17941,18028
209,Prince Milan was suddenly seized with an ardent desire to enter the town. ,18028,18102
210,"'Oh my beloved,' implored Hyacinthia, 'please don't go; ",18102,18158
211, for I am frightened and fear some evil.' ,18157,18199
212,'What are you afraid of?' ,18199,18225
213,asked the Prince. ,18225,18243
214,"'We'll only go and look at what's to be seen in the town for about an hour, and then we'll continue our journey to my father's kingdom.' ",18243,18380
215,"'The town is easy to get into, but more difficult to get out of,' sighed Hyacinthia. ",18380,18465
216,'But let it be as you wish. ,18465,18493
217,"Go, and I will await you here, but I will first change myself into a white milestone; ",18493,18579
218, only I pray you be very careful. ,18578,18612
219,"The King and Queen of the town will come out to meet you, leading a little child with them. ",18612,18704
220,"Whatever you do, don't kiss the child, or you will forget me and all that has happened to us. ",18704,18798
221,I will wait for you here for three days.' ,18798,18840
222,"The Prince hurried to the town, but Hyacinthia remained behind disguised as a white milestone on the road. ",18840,18947
223,"The first day passed, and then the second, and at last the third also, but Prince Milan did not return, for he had not taken Hyacinthia's advice. ",18947,19093
224,"The King and Queen came out to meet him as she had said, leading with them a lovely fair-haired little girl, whose eyes shone like two clear stars. ",19093,19241
225,"The child at once caressed the Prince, who, carried away by its beauty, bent down and kissed it on the cheek. ",19241,19351
226,"From that moment his memory became a blank, and he forgot all about the beautiful Hyacinthia. ",19351,19445
227,"When the Prince did not return, poor Hyacinthia wept bitterly and changing herself from a milestone into a little blue field flower, she said, 'I will grow here on the wayside till some passer-by tramples me under foot.' ",19445,19666
228,And one of her tears remained as a dewdrop and sparkled on the little blue flower. ,19666,19749
229,"Now it happened shortly after this that an old man passed by, and seeing the flower, he was delighted with its beauty. ",19749,19868
230,He pulled it up carefully by the roots and carried it home. ,19868,19928
231,"Here he planted it in a pot, and watered and tended the little plant carefully. ",19928,20008
232,"And now the most extraordinary thing happened, for from this moment everything in the old man's house was changed. ",20008,20123
233,When he awoke in the morning he always found his room tidied and put into such beautiful order that not a speck of dust was to be found anywhere. ,20123,20269
234,"When he came home at midday, he found a table laid out with the most dainty food, and he had only to sit down and enjoy himself to his heart's content. ",20269,20421
235,"At first he was so surprised he didn't know what to think, but after a time he grew a little uncomfortable, and went to an old witch to ask for advice. ",20421,20573
236,"The witch said, 'Get up before the cock crows, and watch carefully till you see something move, and then throw this cloth quickly over it, and you'll see what will happen.' ",20573,20746
237,All night the old man never closed an eye. ,20746,20789
238,"When the first ray of light entered the room, he noticed that the little blue flower began to tremble, and at last it rose out of the pot and flew about the room, put everything in order, swept away the dust, and lit the fire. ",20789,21016
239,"In great haste the old man sprang from his bed, and covered the flower with the cloth the old witch had given him, and in a moment the beautiful Princess Hyacinthia stood before him. ",21016,21199
240,'What have you done?' ,21199,21221
241,she cried. ,21221,21232
242,'Why have you called me back to life? ,21232,21270
243,"For I have no desire to live since my bridegroom, the beautiful Prince Milan, has deserted me.' ",21270,21366
244,"'Prince Milan is just going to be married,' replied the old man. ",21366,21431
245,"'Everything is being got ready for the feast, and all the invited guests are flocking to the palace from all sides.' ",21431,21548
246,The beautiful Hyacinthia cried bitterly when she heard this; ,21548,21609
247," then she dried her tears, and went into the town dressed as a peasant woman. ",21608,21686
248,"She went straight to the King's kitchen, where the white-aproned cooks were running about in great confusion. ",21686,21796
249,"The Princess went up to the head cook, and said, 'Dear cook, please listen to my request, and let me make a wedding-cake for Prince Milan.' ",21796,21936
250,"The busy cook was just going to refuse her demand and order her out of the kitchen, but the words died on his lips when he turned and beheld the beautiful Hyacinthia, and he answered politely, 'You have just come in the nick of time, fair maiden. ",21936,22183
251,"Bake your cake, and I myself will lay it before Prince Milan.' ",22183,22246
252,The cake was soon made. ,22246,22270
253,"The invited guests were already thronging round the table, when the head cook entered the room, bearing a beautiful wedding cake on a silver dish, and laid it before Prince Milan. ",22270,22450
254,"The guests were all lost in admiration, for the cake was quite a work of art. ",22450,22528
255,"Prince Milan at once proceeded to cut it open, when to his surprise two white doves sprang out of it, and one of them said to the other: 'My dear mate, do not fly away and leave me, and forget me as Prince Milan forgot his beloved Hyacinthia.' ",22528,22772
256,Milan sighed deeply when he heard what the little dove said. ,22772,22833
257,"Then he jumped up suddenly from the table and ran to the door, where he found the beautiful Hyacinthia waiting for him. ",22833,22953
258,"Outside stood his faithful charger, pawing the ground. ",22953,23008
259,"Without pausing for a moment, Milan and Hyacinthia mounted him and galloped as fast as they could into the country of King Kojata. ",23008,23139
260,"The King and Queen received them with such joy and gladness as had never been heard of before, and they all lived happily for the rest of their lives.",23139,23290
