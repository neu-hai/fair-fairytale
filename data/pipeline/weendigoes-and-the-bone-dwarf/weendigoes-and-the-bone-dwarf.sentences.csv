0,"In a lonely forest, there once lived a man and his wife, who had a son. ",0,72
1,"The father went forth every day, according to the custom of the Indians, to hunt for food to supply his family. ",72,184
2,"One day, while he was absent, his wife, on going out of the lodge, looked toward the lake that was near, and she saw a very large man walking on the water, and coming fast toward the lodge. ",184,374
3,"He was already so near that she could not, if she had wished to, escape by flight. ",374,457
4,"She thought to herself, ""What shall I say to the monster?"" ",457,516
5,"As he advanced rapidly, she ran in, and taking the hand of her son, a boy of three or four years old, she led him out. ",516,635
6,"Speaking very loud, ""See, my son,"" she said, ""your grandfather;""",635,699
7,""" and then added, in a tone of appeal and supplication, ""he will have pity on us."" ",698,781
8,"The giant approached and said, with a loud ha! ",781,828
9,ha! ,824,828
10,"""Yes, my son;""",832,846
11,""" and added, addressing the woman, ""Have you any thing to eat?"" ",845,909
12,By good luck the lodge was well supplied with meats of various kinds; ,909,979
13," the woman thought to please him by handing him these, which were savory and carefully prepared. ",978,1075
14,"But he pushed them away in disgust, saying, ""I smell fire;""",1075,1134
15,""" and, not waiting to be invited, he seized upon the carcass of a deer which lay by the door, and dispatched it almost without stopping to take breath. ",1133,1285
16,"When the hunter came home he was surprised to see the monster, he was so very frightful. ",1285,1374
17,"He had again brought a deer, which he had no sooner put down than the cannibal seized it, tore it in pieces, and devoured it as though he had been fasting for a week. ",1374,1541
18,"The hunter looked on in fear and astonishment, and in a whisper he told his wife that he was afraid for their lives, as this monster was one whom Indians call Weendigoes. ",1541,1712
19,"He did not even dare to speak to him, nor did the cannibal say a word, but as soon as he had finished his meal, he stretched himself down and fell asleep. ",1712,1867
20,In the evening the Weendigo told the people that he should go out a hunting; ,1867,1944
21, and he strided away toward the North. ,1943,1982
22,"Toward morning he returned, all besmeared with blood, but he did not make known where he had been nor of what kind of game he had been in quest; ",1982,2127
23, although the hunter and his wife had dreadful suspicions of the sport in which he had been engaged. ,2126,2227
24,"Withal his hunger did not seem to be staid, for he took up the deer which the hunter had brought in, and devoured it eagerly, leaving the family to make their meal of the dried meats which had been reserved in the lodge. ",2227,2448
25,"In this manner the Weendigo and the hunter's family lived for some time, and it surprised them that the monster never attempted their lives; ",2448,2589
26," although he never slept at night, but always went out and returned, by the break of day, stained with blood, and looking very wild and famished. ",2588,2734
27,"When there was no deer to be had wherewith to finish his repast, he said nothing. ",2734,2816
28,"In truth he was always still and gloomy, and he seldom spoke to any of them; ",2816,2893
29," when he did, his discourse was chiefly addressed to the boy. ",2892,2954
30,"One evening, after he had thus sojourned with them for many weeks, he informed the hunter that the time had now arrived for him to take his leave, but that before doing so, he would give him a charm that would bring good luck to his lodge. ",2954,3194
31,"He presented to him two arrows, and thanking the hunter and his wife for their kindness, the Weendigo departed, saying, as he left them, that he had all the world to travel over. ",3194,3373
32,"The hunter and his wife were happy when he was gone, for they had looked every moment to have been devoured by him. ",3373,3489
33,"He tried the arrows, and they never failed to bring down whatever they were aimed at. ",3489,3575
34,"They had lived on, prosperous and contented, for a year, when, one day, the hunter being absent, his wife on going out of the lodge, saw something like a black cloud approaching. ",3575,3754
35,"She looked until it came near, when she perceived that it was another Weendigo or Giant Cannibal. ",3754,3852
36,"Remembering the good conduct of the other, she had no fear of this one, and asked him to look into the lodge. ",3852,3962
37,He did so; ,3962,3973
38," and finding after he had glared around, that there was no food at hand, he grew very wroth, and, being sorely disappointed, he took the lodge and threw it to the winds. ",3972,4142
39,He seemed hardly at first to notice the woman in his anger; ,4142,4202
40," but presently he cast a fierce glance upon her, and seizing her by the waist, in spite of her cries and entreaties, he bore her off. ",4201,4335
41,"To the little son, who ran to and fro lamenting, he paid no heed. ",4335,4401
42,"At night-fall, when the hunter returned from the forest, he was amazed. ",4401,4473
43,"His lodge was gone, and he saw his son sitting near the spot where it had stood, shedding tears. ",4473,4570
44,"The son pointed in the direction the Weendigo had taken, and as the father hurried along he found the remains of his wife strewn upon the ground. ",4570,4716
45,"The hunter blackened his face, and vowed in his heart that he would have revenge. ",4716,4798
46,"He built another lodge, and gathering together the bones of his wife, he placed them in the hollow part of a dry tree. ",4798,4917
47,"He left his boy to take care of the lodge while he was absent, hunting and roaming about from place to place, striving to forget his misfortune, and searching for the wicked Weendigo. ",4917,5101
48,"He had been gone but a little while one morning, when his son shot his arrows out through the top of the lodge, and running out to look for them, he could find them nowhere. ",5101,5275
49,"The boy had been trying his luck, and he was puzzled that he had shot his shafts entirely out of sight. ",5275,5379
50,"His father made him more arrows, and when he was again left alone, he shot one of them out; ",5379,5471
51," but although he looked as sharply as he could toward the spot where it fell, and ran thither at once, he could not find it. ",5470,5595
52,"He shot another, which was lost in the same way; ",5595,5644
53," and returning to the lodge to replenish his quiver, he happened to espy one of the lucky arrows, which the first Weendigo had given to his father, hanging upon the side of the lodge. ",5643,5827
54,"He reached up, and having secured it, he shot it out at the opening, and immediately running out to find where it fell, he was surprised to see a beautiful boy just in the act of taking it up, and hurrying away with it to a large tree, where he disappeared. ",5827,6085
55,"The hunter's son followed, and having come to the tree, he beheld the face of the boy looking out through an opening in the hollow part. ",6085,6222
56,"""Ha! ",6222,6227
57,"ha!"" ",6227,6232
58,"he said, ""my friend, come out and play with me;""",6232,6280
59,""" and he urged the boy till he consented. ",6279,6321
60,They played and shot their arrows by turns. ,6321,6365
61,"Suddenly the young boy said, ""Your father is coming. ",6365,6418
62,We must stop. ,6418,6432
63,"Promise me that you will not tell him."" ",6432,6472
64,"The hunter's son promised, and the other disappeared in the tree. ",6472,6538
65,"When the hunter returned from the chase, his son sat demurely by the fire. ",6538,6613
66,In the course of the evening he asked his father to make him a new bow; ,6613,6685
67," and when he was questioned as to the use he could find for two bows, he answered that one might break or get lost. ",6684,6800
68,"The father pleased at his son's diligence in the practice of the bow, made him the two weapons; ",6800,6896
69," and the next day, as soon as his father had gone away, the boy ran to the hollow tree, and invited his little friend to come out and play; ",6895,7035
70, at the same time presenting to him the new bow. ,7034,7083
71,"They went and played in the lodge together, and in their sport they raised the ashes all over it. ",7083,7181
72,"Suddenly again the youngest said, ""Your father is coming, I must leave."" ",7181,7254
73,"He again exacted a promise of secresy, and went back to his tree. ",7254,7320
74,The eldest took his seat near the fire. ,7320,7360
75,When the hunter came in he was surprised to see the ashes scattered about. ,7360,7435
76,"""Why, my son,"" he said, ""you must have played very hard to day to raise such a dust all alone."" ",7435,7531
77,"""Yes,"" the boy answered, ""I was very lonesome, and I ran round and round--that is the cause of it."" ",7531,7631
78,The next day the hunter made ready for the chase as usual. ,7631,7690
79,"The boy said, ""Father, try and hunt all day, and see what you can kill."" ",7690,7763
80,"He had no sooner set out than the boy called his friend, and they played and chased each other round the lodge. ",7763,7875
81,"They had great delight in each other's company, and made merry by the hour. ",7875,7951
82,"The hunter was again returning, and came to a rising ground, which caught the winds as they passed, and he heard his son laughing and making a noise, but the sounds as they reached him on the hill-top, seemed as if they arose from two persons playing. ",7951,8203
83,"At the same time the younger boy stopped, and after saying ""Your father is coming,"" he stole away, under cover of the high grass, to his hollow tree, which was not far off. ",8203,8376
84,"The hunter, on entering, found his son sitting by the fire, very quiet and unconcerned, although he saw that all the articles of the lodge were lying thrown about in all directions. ",8376,8558
85,"""Why, my son,"" he said ""you must play very hard every day; ",8558,8617
86," and what is it that you do, all alone, to throw the lodge in such confusion?"" ",8616,8695
87,The boy again had his excuse. ,8695,8725
88,"""Father,"" he answered, ""I play in this manner: I chase and drag my blanket around the lodge, and that is the reason you see the ashes spread about."" ",8725,8874
89,"The hunter was not satisfied until his son had shown him how he played with the blanket, which he did so adroitly as to set his father laughing, and at last drive him out of the lodge with the great clouds of ashes that he raised. ",8874,9105
90,"The next morning the boy renewed his request that his father should be absent all day, and see if he could not kill two deer. ",9105,9231
91,"The hunter thought this a strange desire on the part of his son, but as he had always humored the boy, he went into the forest as usual, bent on accomplishing his wish, if he could. ",9231,9413
92,"As soon as he was out of sight, his son hastened to his young companion at the tree, and they continued their sports. ",9413,9531
93,"The father on nearing his home in the evening, as he reached the rising ground, again heard the sounds of play and laughter; ",9531,9656
94," and as the wind brought them straight to his ear, he was now certain that there were two voices. ",9655,9753
95,"The boy from the tree had no more than time to escape, when the hunter entered, and found his son, sitting as usual, near the fire. ",9753,9885
96,"When he cast his eyes around, he saw that the lodge was in greater confusion than before. ",9885,9975
97,"""My son,"" he said, ""you must be very foolish when alone to play so. ",9975,10043
98,"But, tell me, my son; ",10043,10065
99," I heard two voices, I am sure;""",10064,10096
100,""" and he looked closely on the prints of the footsteps in the ashes. ",10095,10164
101,"""True,"" he continued, ""here is the print of a foot which is smaller than my son's;""",10164,10247
102,""" and he was now satisfied that his suspicions were well founded, and that some very young person had been the companion of his son. ",10246,10379
103,The boy could not now refuse to tell his father what had happened. ,10379,10446
104,"""Father,"" he said, ""I found a boy in the hollow of that tree, near the lodge, where you placed my mother's bones."" ",10446,10561
105,Strange thoughts came over the mind of the hunter; ,10561,10612
106, did his wife live again in this beautiful child? ,10611,10661
107,"Fearful of disturbing the dead, he did not dare to visit the place where he had deposited her remains. ",10661,10764
108,"He, however, engaged his son to entice the boy to a dead tree, by the edge of a wood, where they could kill many flying-squirrels by setting it on fire. ",10764,10917
109,"He said that he would conceal himself near by, and take the boy. ",10917,10982
110,"The next day the hunter accordingly went into the woods, and his son, calling the boy from the tree, urged him to go with him to kill the squirrels. ",10982,11131
111,"The boy objected that his father was near, but he was at length prevailed on to go, and after they had fired the tree, and while they were busy killing or taking the squirrels, the hunter suddenly made his appearance, and clasped the strange boy in his arms. ",11131,11390
112,"He cried out, ""Kago, kago, don't, don't. ",11390,11431
113,"You will tear my clothes!"" ",11431,11458
114,"for he was clad in a fine apparel, which shone as if it had been made of a beautiful transparent skin. ",11458,11561
115,The father reassured him by every means in his power. ,11561,11615
116,By constant kindness and gentle words the boy was reconciled to remain with them; ,11615,11697
117," but chiefly by the presence of his young friend, the hunter's son, to whom he was fondly attached. ",11696,11796
118,The children were never parted from each other; ,11796,11844
119," and when the hunter looked upon the strange boy, he seemed to see living in him the better spirit of his lost wife. ",11843,11960
120,"He was thankful to the Great Spirit for this act of goodness, and in his heart he felt assured that in time the boy would show great virtue, and in some way avenge him on the wicked Weendigo who had destroyed the companion of his lodge. ",11960,12197
121,"The hunter grew at ease in his spirit, and gave all of the time he could spare from the chase to the society of the two children; ",12197,12327
122," but, what affected him the most, both of his sons, although they were well-formed and beautiful, grew no more in stature, but remained children still. ",12326,12478
123,"Every day they resembled each other more and more, and they never ceased to sport and divert themselves in the innocent ways of childhood. ",12478,12617
124,"One day the hunter had gone abroad with his bow and arrows, leaving, at the request of the strange boy, one of the two shafts which the friendly Weendigo had given to him, behind in the lodge. ",12617,12810
125,"When he returned, what were his surprise and joy to see stretched dead by his lodge-door, the black giant who had slain his wife. ",12810,12940
126,He had been stricken down by the magic shaft in the hands of the little stranger from the tree; ,12940,13036
127," and ever after the boy, or the Bone-Dwarf as he was called, was the guardian and good genius of the lodge, and no evil spirit, giant, or Weendigo, dared approach it to mar their peace.",13035,13221
