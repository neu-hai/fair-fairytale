0,Once upon a time a lad who tended the cattle in the wood was eating his noon-tide meal in a clearing in the forest. ,0,116
1,As he was sitting there he saw a rat run into a juniper-bush. ,116,178
2,His curiosity led him to look for it. ,178,216
3,"As he bent over, down he went, head over heels, and fell asleep. ",216,281
4,And he dreamed that he was going to find the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen; ,281,369
5, but that he did not know the way. ,368,403
6,The following day he once more pastured his cattle in the wood. ,403,467
7,"When he came to the same clearing, and again ate his dinner there. ",467,534
8,"And again he saw the rat and went to look for it, and again when he bent down he went head over heels, and fell fast asleep. ",534,659
9,"And again he dreamed of the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen, and that in order to get her he would need seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes. ",659,822
10,He awoke and it was all a dream. ,822,855
11,"By now he had made up his mind to find the Mount of the Golden Queen, and he went home with his herd. ",855,957
12,"On the third day, when he led out his cattle, he could not reach the clearing of his happy dream too soon. ",957,1064
13,"Again the rat showed itself and when he went to look for it, he fell asleep as he had done each preceding day. ",1064,1175
14,"And again he dreamed of the princess on the Mount of the Golden Queen, and that she came to him, and laid a letter and a band of gold in his pocket. ",1175,1324
15,"Then he awoke and to his indescribable surprise, he found in his pocket both of the things of which he had dreamed, the letter and the band. ",1324,1465
16,"Now he had no time to attend to the cattle any longer, but drove them straight home. ",1465,1550
17,"Then he went into the stable, led out a horse, sold it, and bought seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes with the money. ",1550,1681
18,"He made the thole-pins out of the iron, put on his iron shoes, and set forth. ",1681,1759
19,For a time he traveled by land. ,1759,1791
20,At last he came to the lake which he had to cross. ,1791,1842
21,"He saw nothing but water before and behind him, and rowing so long and steadily that he wore out one thole-pin after another. ",1842,1968
22,"He at length reached land, and a green meadow, where no trees grew. ",1968,2036
23,"He walked all around the meadow, and at last found a mound of earth from which smoke was rising. ",2036,2133
24,"When he looked more closely, out came a woman who was nine yards long. ",2133,2204
25,He asked her to tell him the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen. ,2204,2271
26,"But she replied: ""That I do not know. ",2271,2309
27,"Go ask my sister, who is nine yards taller than I am, and who lives in an earth-mound which you can find without any trouble."" ",2309,2436
28,"So he left her and came to a mound of earth that looked just like the first, and from which smoke was also rising. ",2436,2551
29,"A woman at once came out who was tremendously tall, and of her he asked the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen. ",2551,2665
30,"""That I do not know,"" said she. ",2665,2697
31,"""Go ask my brother, who is nine yards taller than I am, and who lives in a hill a little further away."" ",2697,2801
32,"So he came to the hill, from which smoke was also rising, and knocked. ",2801,2872
33,"A man at once came out who was a veritable giant, for he was twenty-seven yards in length, and of him he asked the way to the Mount of the Golden Queen. ",2872,3025
34,"Then the giant took a whistle and whistled in every direction, to call together all the animals to be found on the earth. ",3025,3147
35,"And all the animals came from the woods, notably among them a bear. ",3147,3215
36,"The giant asked him about the Mount of the Golden Queen, but he knew nothing of it. ",3215,3299
37,Again the giant blew his whistle in every direction to call together all the fishes to be found in the waters. ,3299,3410
38,"They came at once, and he asked them about the Mount of the Golden Queen; ",3410,3484
39, but they knew nothing of it. ,3483,3513
40,"Once more the giant blew his whistle in every direction, and called together all the birds of the air. ",3513,3616
41,"They came, and he asked the eagle about the Mount of the Golden Queen, and whether he knew where it might be. ",3616,3726
42,"The eagle said: ""Yes!"" ",3726,3749
43,"""Well then, take this lad there,"" said the giant ""but do not treat him unkindly!"" ",3749,3831
44,"This the eagle promised, allowed the youth to seat himself on his back, and then off they were through the air, over fields and forests, hill and dale. ",3831,3983
45,"Before long they were above the ocean, and could see nothing but sky and water. ",3983,4063
46,"Then the eagle dipped the youth in the ocean up to his ankles and asked: ""Are you afraid?"" ",4063,4154
47,"""No,"" said the youth. ",4154,4176
48,"Then the eagle flew on a while, and again dipped the youth into the water, up to his knees and said: ""Are you afraid?"" ",4176,4295
49,"""Yes,"" answered the youth, ""but the giant said you were not to treat me unkindly."" ",4295,4378
50,"""Are you really afraid?"" ",4378,4403
51,asked the eagle once more. ,4403,4430
52,"""Yes,"" answered the youth. ",4430,4457
53,"Then the eagle said: ""The fear you now feel is the very same fear I felt when the princess thrust the letter and the golden band into your pocket."" ",4457,4605
54,"And with that they had reached a large, high mountain in one side of which was a great iron door. ",4605,4703
55,"They knocked, and a serving-maid appeared to open the door and admit them. ",4703,4778
56,The youth remained and was well received. ,4778,4820
57,The eagle said farewell and flew back to his native land. ,4820,4878
58,"The youth asked for a drink, and he was at once handed a beaker containing a refreshing draught. ",4878,4975
59,"When he had emptied it and returned the beaker, he let the golden band drop into it. ",4975,5060
60,"And when the maid brought back the beaker to her mistress-who was the princess of the Mount of the Golden Queen-the latter looked into the beaker, and behold, there lay a golden band which she recognized as her own. ",5060,5276
61,"So she asked: ""Is there some one here?"" ",5276,5316
62,"and when the maid answered in the affirmative, the princess said: ""Bid him come in!."" ",5316,5402
63,"As soon as the youth entered, she asked him if he chanced to have a letter. ",5402,5478
64,"The youth drew out the letter he had received in so strange a manner, and gave it to the princess. ",5478,5577
65,"And when she had read it she cried, full of joy: ""Now I am delivered!"" ",5577,5648
66,"At that very moment the mountain turned into a most handsome castle, with all sorts of precious things, servants, and every sort of convenience, each for its own purpose. ",5648,5819
67,(Whether the princess and the youth married the story does not say; ,5819,5887
68, yet we must take for granted that a wedding is the proper end for the fairy-tale).,5886,5970
