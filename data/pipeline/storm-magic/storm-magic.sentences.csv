0,The cabin-boy had been traveling around all summer long with his captain; ,0,74
1," but when they began to prepare to set sail in the fall, he grew restless and did not want to go along. ",73,177
2,"The captain liked him, for though he was no more than a boy, he was quite at home on deck, was a big, tall lad, and did not mind lending a hand when need arose; ",177,338
3," then, too, he did as much work as an able seaman, and was so full of fun that he kept the whole crew in good humor. ",337,454
4,And so the captain did not like to lose him. ,454,499
5,But the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the blue pond in the fall; ,499,591
6, though he was willing to stay on board till the ship was loaded and ready to sail. ,590,674
7,"One Sunday, while the crew was ashore, and the captain had gone to a farm-holding near the forest, in order to bargain for small timber and log wood--presumably on his own account--for a deck load, the youth had been left to guard the ship. ",674,915
8,"But you must know that he was a Sunday child, and had found a four-leaf clover; ",915,995
9, and that was the reason he had the second sight. ,994,1044
10,"He could see those who are invisible, but they could not see him. ",1044,1110
11,"And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin, he heard voices within the ship. ",1110,1193
12,"He peered through a crack, and there were three coal-black crows sitting inside the deck-beams, and they were talking about their husbands. ",1193,1333
13,"All three were tired of them, and were planning their death. ",1333,1394
14,"One could see at once that they were witches, who had assumed another form. ",1394,1470
15,"""But is it certain that there is no one here who can overhear us?"" ",1470,1537
16,said one of the crows. ,1537,1560
17,And by the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for the captain's wife. ,1560,1632
18,"""No, you can see there's not,"" said the others, the wives of the first and second quartermasters. ",1632,1730
19,"""There is not a soul aboard."" ",1730,1760
20,"""Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of a good way to get rid of them,"" said the captain's wife once more, and hopped closer to the two others. ",1760,1912
21,"""We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them into the sea, and sink the ship with every man on board."" ",1912,2019
22,"That pleased the others, and they sat there a long time discussing the day and the fairway. ",2019,2111
23,"""But is it certain that no one can overhear us?"" ",2111,2160
24,once more asked the captain's wife. ,2160,2196
25,"""You know that such is the case,"" said the two others. ",2196,2251
26,"""Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish to do, and if it is used, it will go hard with us, for it will cost us nothing less than our lives!"" ",2251,2401
27,"""What is the counter-spell, sister,"" asked the wife of the one quartermaster. ",2401,2479
28,"""Is it certain that no one is listening to us? ",2479,2526
29,"It seemed to me as though some one were smoking in the forward cabin."" ",2526,2597
30,"""But you know we looked in every corner. ",2597,2638
31,"They just forgot to let the fire go out in the caboose, and that is why there's smoke,"" said the quartermaster's wife, ""so tell away."" ",2638,2773
32,"""If they buy three cords of birch-wood,"" said the witch,--""but it must be full measure, and they must not bargain for it--and throw the first cord into the water, billet by billet, when the first breaker strikes, and the second cord, billet by billet, when the second breaker strikes, and the third cord, billet by billet, when the third breaker strikes, then it is all up with us!"" ",2773,3156
33,"""Yes, that's true, sister, then it is all up with us! ",3156,3210
34,"Then it is all up with us!"" ",3210,3238
35,said the wives of the quartermasters; ,3238,3276
36," ""but there is no one who knows it,"" they cried, and laughed loudly, and with that they flew out of the hatchway, screaming and croaking like ravens. ",3275,3425
37,"When it came time to sail, the cabin-boy would not go along for anything in the world; ",3425,3512
38," and all the captain's coaxing, and all his promises were useless, nothing would tempt him to go. ",3511,3609
39,"At last they asked him whether he were afraid, because fall was at hand, and said he would rather hide behind the stove, hanging to mother's apron strings. ",3609,3765
40,"No, said the youth, he was not afraid, and they could not say that they had ever seen him show a sign of so land-lubberly a thing as fear; ",3765,3904
41," and he was willing to prove it to them, for now he was going along with them, but he made it a condition that three cords of birch-wood were to be bought, full measure, and that on a certain day he was to have command, just as though he himself were the captain. ",3903,4167
42,"The captain asked what sort of nonsense this might be, and whether he had ever heard of a cabin-boy's being entrusted with the command of a ship. ",4167,4313
43,But the boy answered that was all one to him; ,4313,4359
44," if they did not care to buy the three cords of birch-wood, and obey him, as though he were captain, for the space of a single day--the captain and crew should know which day it was to be in advance--then he would set foot on the ship no more, and far less would he ever dirty his hands with pitch and tar on her again. ",4358,4678
45,"The whole thing seemed strange to the captain, yet he finally gave in, because he wanted to have the boy along with him and, no doubt, he also thought that he would come to his senses again when they were once under way. ",4678,4899
46,The quartermaster was of the same opinion. ,4899,4942
47,"""Just let him command all he likes, and if things go wrong with him, we'll help him out,"" said he. ",4942,5041
48,"So the birch-wood was bought, full-measure and without haggling, and they set sail. ",5041,5125
49,"When the day came on which the cabin-boy was to take command, the weather was fair and quiet; ",5125,5219
50," but he drummed up the whole ship's crew, and with the exception of a tiny bit of canvas, had all sails reefed. ",5218,5330
51,"The captain and crew laughed at him, and said: ""That shows the sort of a captain we have now. ",5330,5424
52,"Don't you want us to reef that last bit of sail this very minute?"" ",5424,5491
53,"""Not yet,"" answered the cabin-boy, ""but before long."" ",5491,5545
54,"Suddenly a squall struck them, struck them so heavily that they thought they would capsize, and had they not reefed the sails they would undoubtedly have foundered when the first breaker roared down upon the ship. ",5545,5759
55,"The boy ordered them to throw the first cord of birch-wood overboard, billet by billet, one at a time and never two, and he did not let them touch the other two cords. ",5759,5927
56,"Now they obeyed him to the letter, and did not laugh; ",5927,5981
57, but cast out the birch-wood billet by billet. ,5980,6027
58,"When the last billet fell they heard a groaning, as though some one were wrestling with death, and then the squall had passed. ",6027,6154
59,"""Heaven be praised!"" ",6154,6175
60,"said the crew--and the captain added: ""I am going to let the company know that you saved ship and cargo."" ",6175,6281
61,"""That's all very well, but we are not through yet,"" said the boy, ""there is worse to come,"" and he told them to reef every last rag, as well as what had been left of the topsails. ",6281,6461
62,"The second squall hit them with even greater force than the first, and was so vicious and violent that the whole crew was frightened. ",6461,6595
63,"While it was at its worst, the boy told them to throw overboard the second cord; ",6595,6676
64," and they threw it over billet by billet, and took care not to take any from the third cord. ",6675,6768
65,"When the last billet fell, they again heard a deep groan, and then all was still. ",6768,6850
66,"""Now there will be one more squall, and that will be the worst,"" said the boy, and sent every one to his station. ",6850,6964
67,There was not a hawser loose on the whole ship. ,6964,7012
68,"The last squall hit them with far more force than either of the preceding ones, the ship laid over on her side so that they thought she would not right herself again, and the breaker swept over the deck. ",7012,7216
69,"But the boy told them to throw the last cord of wood overboard, billet by billet, and no two billets at once. ",7216,7326
70,"And when the last billet of wood fell, they heard a deep groaning, as though some one were dying hard, and when all was quiet once more, the whole sea was the color of blood, as far as eye could reach. ",7326,7528
71,"When they reached land, the captain and the quartermasters spoke of writing to their wives. ",7528,7620
72,"""That is something you might just as well let be,"" said the cabin-boy, ""seeing that you no longer have any wives."" ",7620,7735
73,"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! ",7735,7780
74,"We have no wives?"" ",7780,7799
75,said the captain. ,7799,7817
76,"""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" ",7817,7865
77,asked the quartermasters. ,7865,7891
78,"""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on watch on the ship; ",7891,8051
79," while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying his deckload of wood. ",8050,8127
80,"And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard anything more of them.",8127,8294
