0,"Wassamo was living with his parents on the shore of a large bay, far out in the north-east. ",0,92
1,"One day, when the season had commenced for fish to be plenty, the mother of Wassamo said to him, ""My son, I wish you would go to yonder point and see if you can not procure me some fish; ",92,279
2," and ask your cousin to accompany you."" ",278,318
3,He did so. ,318,329
4,"They set out, and in the course of the afternoon they arrived at the fishing-ground. ",329,414
5,"The cousin, being the elder, attended to the nets, and they encamped near by, using the bark of the birch for a lodge to shelter them through the night. ",414,567
6,"They lit a fire, and while they sat conversing with each other, the moon arose. ",567,647
7,Not a breath of wind disturbed the smooth surface of the lake. ,647,710
8,Not a cloud was seen. ,710,732
9,"Wassamo looked out on the water toward their nets, and he saw that the little black spots, which were no other than the floats, dotting the lake, had disappeared. ",732,895
10,"""Cousin,"" he said, ""let us visit our nets; ",895,938
11," perhaps we are fortunate."" ",937,965
12,"When they drew up the nets they were rejoiced to see the meshes shining white, all over, with the glittering prey. ",965,1080
13,"They landed in fine spirits, and put away their canoe in safety from the winds. ",1080,1160
14,"""Wassamo,"" said the cousin, ""you cook that we may eat."" ",1160,1216
15,"Wassamo set about the work at once, and soon had his great kettle swung upon its branch, while the cousin lay at his ease upon the other side of the fire. ",1216,1371
16,"""Cousin,"" said Wassamo, ""tell me stories or sing me some love-songs."" ",1371,1441
17,"The cousin obeyed, and sung his plaintive songs; ",1441,1490
18," or he would frequently break off in the midst of a mournful chant, and begin to recite a mirthful story, and then in the midst of Wassamo's laughter he would return to the plaintive ditty--just as it suited his fancy; ",1489,1708
19," for the cousin was gay of spirit, and shifted his humor faster than the fleecy clouds that appeared and disappeared in the night-sky over their heads. ",1707,1859
20,"In this changeful pastime the cousin ran his length, and then he fell away, murmuring parts of his song or story, into a silvery sleep; ",1859,1995
21, with the moon gliding through the branches and gilding his face. ,1994,2060
22,Wassamo in the mean while had lost the sound of his cousin's voice in the rich simmer of the kettle; ,2060,2161
23," and when its music pleased his ear the most, as announcing that the fish were handsomely cooked, he lifted the kettle from the fire. ",2160,2294
24,"He spoke to his cousin, but he received no answer. ",2294,2345
25,"He went on with his housekeeping alone, and took the wooden ladle and skimmed the kettle neatly, for the fish were very plump and fat. ",2345,2480
26,"Wassamo had a torch of twisted bark in one hand to give light, and when he came to take out the fish, there was no one to have charge of the torch. ",2480,2628
27,"The cousin was so happy in his sleep, with the silver moon kissing his cheeks, as though she were enamored of his fair looks, that Wassamo had not the heart to call him up. ",2628,2801
28,"Binding his girdle upon his brow, in this he thrust the torch, and went forward, with the light dancing through the green leaves at every turn of his head, to prepare the evening meal. ",2801,2986
29,"He again spoke to his cousin, but gently, to learn whether he was in truth asleep. ",2986,3069
30,"The cousin murmured, but made no reply; ",3069,3109
31, and Wassamo stepped softly about with the dancing fire-plume lighting up the gloom of the forest at every turn he made. ,3108,3229
32,"Suddenly he heard a laugh It was double, or the one must be the perfect echo of the other. ",3229,3320
33,To Wassamo there appeared to be two persons at no great distance. ,3320,3386
34,"""Cousin,"" said Wassamo, ""some person is near us. ",3386,3435
35,I hear a laugh; ,3435,3451
36," awake and let us look out!"" ",3450,3479
37,The cousin made no answer. ,3479,3506
38,"Again Wassamo heard the laughter in mirthful repetition, like the ripple of the water-brook upon the shining pebbles of the stream. ",3506,3638
39,"Peering out as far as the line of the torchlight pierced into the darkness, he beheld two beautiful young females smiling on him. ",3638,3768
40,"Their countenances appeared to be perfectly white, like the fresh snow. ",3768,3840
41,"He crouched down and pushed his cousin, saying, in a low voice, ""Awake! ",3840,3912
42,awake! ,3912,3919
43,"here are two young women."" ",3919,3946
44,But he received no answer. ,3946,3973
45,His cousin seemed lost to all earthly sense and sound; ,3973,4028
46," for he lay unmoved, smiling, in the calm light of the moon. ",4027,4088
47,"Wassamo started up alone, and glided toward the strange females. ",4088,4153
48,As he approached them he was more and more enraptured with their beauty; ,4153,4226
49," but just as he was about to speak to them, he suddenly fell to the earth, and they all three vanished together. ",4225,4338
50,"The moon shone where they had just stood, but she saw them not. ",4338,4402
51,"A gentle sound of music and soft voices accompanied their vanishing, and this wakened the cousin. ",4402,4500
52,"As he opened his eyes, in a dreamy way, he saw the kettle near him. ",4500,4568
53,Some of the fish he observed were in the bowl. ,4568,4615
54,"The fire flickered, and made light and shadow; ",4615,4662
55, but nowhere was Wassamo to be seen. ,4661,4698
56,"He waited, and waited again, in the expectation that Wassamo would appear. ",4698,4773
57,"""Perhaps,"" thought the cousin, ""he is gone out again to visit the nets."" ",4773,4846
58,"He looked off that way, but the canoe still lay close by the rock at the shore. ",4846,4926
59,"He searched and found his footsteps in the ashes, and out upon the green ground a little distance, and then they were utterly lost. ",4926,5058
60,"He was now greatly troubled in spirit, and he called aloud, ""Netawis! ",5058,5128
61,cousin! ,5128,5136
62,"cousin!"" ",5136,5145
63,but there was no answer to his call. ,5145,5182
64,"He called again in his sorrow, louder and louder, ""Netawis! ",5182,5242
65,Netawis! ,5119,5128
66,cousin! ,5128,5136
67,cousin! ,5128,5136
68,"whither are you gone?"" ",5267,5290
69,But no answer came to his voice of wailing. ,5290,5334
70,"He started for the edge of the woods, crying as he ran, ""My cousin!"" ",5334,5403
71,"and ""Oh, my cousin!"" ",5403,5424
72,Hither and thither through the forest he sped with all his fleetness of foot and quickness of spirit; ,5424,5526
73," and when at last he found that no voice would answer him, he burst into tears, and sobbed aloud. ",5525,5623
74,"He returned to the fire, and sat down. ",5623,5662
75,He mused upon the absence of Wassamo with a sorely-troubled heart. ,5662,5729
76,"""He may have been playing me a trick,"" he thought; ",5729,5780
77," but it was full time that the trick should be at an end, and Wassamo returned not. ",5779,5863
78,"The cousin cherished other hopes, but they all died away in the morning light, when he found himself alone by the hunting-fire. ",5863,5991
79,"""How shall I answer to his friends for Wassamo?"" ",5991,6040
80,thought the cousin. ,6040,6060
81,"""Although,"" he said to himself, ""his parents are my kindred, and they are well assured that their son is my bosom-friend, will they receive that belief in the place of him who is lost. ",6060,6245
82,"No, no; ",6245,6253
83," they will say that I have slain him, and they will require blood for blood. ",6252,6329
84,Oh! ,6329,6333
85,"my cousin, whither are you gone?"" ",6333,6367
86,"He would have rested to restore his mind to its peace, but he could not sleep; ",6367,6446
87," and, without further regard to net or canoe, he set off for the village, running all the way. ",6445,6540
88,"As they saw him approaching at such speed and alone, they said, ""Some accident has happened."" ",6540,6634
89,"When he had come into the village, he told them how Wassamo had disappeared. ",6634,6711
90,He stated all the circumstances. ,6711,6744
91,He kept nothing to himself. ,6744,6772
92,He declared all that he knew. ,6772,6802
93,"Some said, ""He has killed him in the dark."" ",6802,6846
94,"Others said, ""It is impossible; ",6846,6878
95, they were like brothers; ,6877,6903
96, they would have fallen for each other. ,6902,6942
97,"It can not be."" ",6942,6958
98,"At the cousin's request, many of the men visited the fish-fire. ",6958,7022
99,There were no marks of blood. ,7022,7052
100,No hasty steps were there to show that any conflict or struggle had occurred. ,7052,7130
101,Every leaf on every tree was in its place; ,7130,7173
102," and they saw, as the cousin had before, that the foot-prints of Wassamo stopped in the wood, as if he had gone no further upon the earth, but had ascended into the air. ",7172,7342
103,"They returned to the village, and no man was the wiser as to the strange and sudden vanishing of Wassamo. ",7342,7448
104,None ever looked to see him more; ,7448,7482
105," only the parents, who still hoped and awaited his return. ",7481,7540
106,"The spring, with all its blossoms and its delicate newness of life, came among them; ",7540,7625
107, the Indians assembled to celebrate their vernal feast from all the country round. ,7624,7707
108,Among them came the sad cousin of Wassamo. ,7707,7750
109,He was pale and thin as the shadow of the shaft that flies. ,7750,7810
110,"The pain of his mind had changed his features, and wherever he turned his eyes, they were dazzled with the sight of the red blood of his friend. ",7810,7955
111,"The parents of Wassamo, far gone in despair, and weary with watching for his return, now demanded the life of Netawis. ",7955,8074
112,The village was stirred to its very heart by their loud lamentings; ,8074,8142
113," and, after a struggle of pity, they decided to give the young man's life to the parents. ",8141,8231
114,They said that they had waited long enough. ,8231,8275
115,A day was appointed on which the cousin was to yield his life for his friend's. ,8275,8355
116,"He was a brave youth, and they bound him only by his word to be ready at the appointed hour. ",8355,8448
117,He said that he was not afraid to die; ,8448,8487
118, for he was innocent of the great wrong they laid to his charge. ,8486,8551
119,"A day or two before the time set to take his life, he wandered sadly along the shore of the lake. ",8551,8649
120,"He looked at the glassy water, and more than once the thought to end his griefs by casting himself in its depths, came upon him with such sudden force that it was only by severe self-control that he was able to turn his steps in another direction. ",8649,8897
121,"He reflected--""They will say that I was guilty if I take my own life. ",8897,8967
122,No. ,8967,8971
123,"I will give them my blood for that of my cousin."" ",8971,9021
124,"He walked on, with slow steps, but he found no comfort, turn where he would; ",9021,9098
125, the sweet songs of the grove jarred upon his ear; ,9097,9148
126, the beauty of the blue sky pained his sight; ,9147,9193
127," and the soft green earth, as he trode upon it, seemed harsh to his foot, and sent a pang through every nerve. ",9192,9303
128,"""Oh, where is my cousin?"" ",9303,9329
129,he kept saying to himself. ,9329,9356
130,"Meanwhile, when Wassamo fell senseless before the two young women in the wood, he lost all knowledge of himself until he wakened in a distant scene. ",9356,9505
131,He heard persons conversing. ,9505,9534
132,"One spoke in a tone of command, saying, ""You foolish girls, is this the way that you rove about at nights without our knowledge? ",9534,9663
133,"Put that person you have brought on that couch of yours, and do not let him lie upon the ground."" ",9663,9761
134,"Wassamo felt himself moved, he knew not how, and placed upon a couch. ",9761,9831
135,"Some time after, the spell seemed to be a little lightened, and on opening his eyes, he was surprised to find that he was lying in a spacious and shining lodge, extending as far as the eye could reach. ",9831,10033
136,"One spoke to him and said: ""Stranger, awake, and take something wherewith to refresh yourself."" ",10033,10129
137,He obeyed the command and sat up. ,10129,10163
138,On either side of the lodge he beheld rows of people seated in orderly array. ,10163,10241
139,"At a distance he could see two stately persons, who looked rather more in years than the others, and who appeared to exact obedience from all around them. ",10241,10396
140,"One of them, whom he heard addressed as the Old Spirit-man, spoke to Wassamo. ",10396,10474
141,"""My son,"" said he, ""know it was those foolish girls who brought you hither. ",10474,10550
142,They saw you at the fishing-ground. ,10550,10586
143,"When you attempted to approach them you fell senseless, and at the same moment they transported you to this place. ",10586,10701
144,We are under the earth. ,10701,10725
145,But be at ease. ,10725,10741
146,We will make your stay with us pleasant. ,10741,10782
147,I am the guardian Spirit of the Sand Mountains. ,10782,10830
148,They are my charge. ,10830,10850
149,"I pile them up, and blow them about, and do whatever I will with them. ",10850,10921
150,"It keeps me very busy, but I am hale for my age, and I love to be employed. ",10921,10997
151,I have often wished to get one of your race to marry among us. ,10997,11060
152,"If you can make up your mind to remain, I will give you one of my daughters--the one who smiled on you first, the night you were brought away from your parents and friends."" ",11060,11234
153,Wassamo dropped his head and made no answer. ,11234,11279
154,"The thought that he should behold his kindred no more, made him sad. ",11279,11348
155,"He was silent, and the Old Spirit continued: ""Your wants will all be supplied; ",11348,11427
156, but you must be careful not to stray far from the lodge. ,11426,11484
157,I am afraid of that Spirit who rules all islands lying in the lakes. ,11484,11553
158,"He is my bitter enemy, for I have refused him my daughter in marriage; ",11553,11624
159," and when he learns that you are a member of my family, he will seek to harm you. ",11623,11705
160,"There is my daughter,"" added the Old Spirit, pointing toward her. ",11705,11771
161,"""Take her. ",11771,11782
162,"She shall be your wife."" ",11782,11807
163,"Forthwith Wassamo and the Old Spirit's daughter sat near each other in the lodge, and they were man and wife. ",11807,11917
164,"One evening the Old Spirit came in after a busy day's work out among the sand-hills, in the course of which he had blown them all out of shape with great gusts of wind, and strewn them about in a thousand directions, and brought them back and piled them up in all sorts of misshapen heaps. ",11917,12207
165,"At the close of this busy day, when the Old Spirit came in very much out of breath, he said to Wassamo, ""Son-in-law, I am in want of tobacco. ",12207,12349
166,None grows about this dry place of mine. ,12349,12390
167,You shall return to your people and procure me a supply. ,12390,12447
168,"It is seldom that the few who pass these sand-hills offer me a piece of tobacco,--it is a rare plant in these parts,--but when they do, it immediately comes to me. ",12447,12611
169,"Just so,"" he added, putting his hand out of the side of the lodge and drawing in several pieces of tobacco which some one passing at that moment offered as a fee to the Old Spirit, to keep the sand-hills from blowing about till they had got by. ",12611,12856
170,"Other gifts beside tobacco came in the same way to the side of the lodge--sometimes a whole bear, then a wampum-robe, then a string of birds--and the Sand-Spirits altogether led an easy life; ",12856,13048
171, for they were not at the trouble to hunt or clothe themselves; ,13047,13111
172," and whenever the housekeeping began to fall short, nothing would happen but a wonderful storm of dust, all the sand-hills being straightway put in an uproar, and the contributions would at once begin to pour in at the side windows of the lodge, till all their wants were supplied. ",13110,13392
173,"After Wassamo had been among these curious people several months, the old Sand-Spirit said to him, ""Son-in-law, you must not be surprised at what you will see next; ",13392,13557
174, for since you have been with us you have never known us to go to sleep. ,13556,13629
175,It has been summer when the sun never sets here where we live. ,13629,13692
176,"But now, what you call winter, is coming on. ",13692,13737
177,"You will soon see us lie down, and we shall not rise again till the spring. ",13737,13813
178,Take my advice. ,13813,13829
179,Do not leave the lodge. ,13829,13853
180,"I have sure knowledge that that knavish Island Spirit is on the prowl, and as he has command of a particular kind of storm, which comes from the south-west, he only waits his opportunity to catch you abroad and do you a mischief. ",13853,14083
181,Try and amuse yourself. ,14083,14107
182,"That cupboard,"" pointing to a corner of the lodge, ""is never empty; ",14107,14175
183, for it is there that all the offerings are handed in while we are asleep. ,14174,14249
184,"It is never empty, and--"" But ere the old Sand-Spirit could utter another word, a loud rattling of thunder was heard, and instantly, not only the Old Spirit but every one of his family, vanished out of sight. ",14249,14458
185,"When the storm had passed by, they all reappeared in the lodge. ",14458,14522
186,This sudden vanishing and reappearance occurred at every tempest. ,14522,14588
187,"""You are surprised,"" said the Old Spirit, ""to see us disappear when it thunders. ",14588,14669
188,"The reason is this: that noise which you fancy is thunder, is our enemy the Island Spirit hallooing on his way home from the hunt. ",14669,14800
189,We get out of sight that we may escape the necessity of asking him to come in and share our evening meal. ,14800,14906
190,"We are not afraid of him, not in the least."" ",14906,14951
191,"Just then it chanced to thunder again, and Wassamo observed that his father-in-law made extraordinary dispatch to conceal himself, although no stranger, at all resembling in any way the Island Spirit, was in view. ",14951,15165
192,"Shortly after this the season of sleep began, and one by one they laid themselves down to the long slumber. ",15165,15273
193,The Old Spirit was the last to drop away; ,15273,15315
194," and, before he yielded, he went forth and had his last sport with the sand-hills, and he so tossed and vexed the poor hills, and scattered them to and fro, and whirled them up in the air, and far over the land, that it was days and days before they got back to any thing like their natural shape. ",15314,15612
195,"While his relations were enjoying this long sleep, Wassamo amused himself as best he could. ",15612,15704
196,"The cupboard never failed him once: for visit it when he would, he always found a fresh supply of game, and every other dainty which his heart desired. ",15704,15856
197,But his chief pastime was to listen to the voices of the travelers who passed by the window at the side of the lodge where they made their requests for comfortable weather and an easy journey. ,15856,16049
198,"These were often mingled with loud complainings, such as ""Ho! ",16049,16111
199,"how the sand jumps about!"" ",16111,16138
200,"""Take away that hill!"" ",16138,16161
201,"""I am lost!"" ",16161,16174
202,"""Old Sand-Spirit, where are you? ",16174,16207
203,"help this way!"" ",16207,16223
204,"and the like, which indicated that such as were journeying through the hills had their own troubles to encounter. ",16223,16337
205,"As the spring-light of the first day of spring shone into the lodge, the whole family arose and went about the affairs of the day as though they had been slumbering only for a single night. ",16337,16527
206,"The rest of the Old Spirit seemed to have done him much good, for he was very cheerful; ",16527,16615
207," and, first putting his head forth from the window for a puff at a sand-hill, which was his prime luxury in a morning, he said to Wassamo, ""Son-in-law, you have been very patient with our long absence from your company, and you shall be rewarded. ",16614,16861
208,In a few days you may start with your wife to visit your relations. ,16861,16929
209,"You can be absent one year, but at the end of that time you must return. ",16929,17002
210,"When you get to your home-village, you must first go in alone. ",17002,17065
211,"Leave your wife at a short distance from the lodge, and when you are welcome, then send for her. ",17065,17162
212,"When there, do not be surprised that she disappears whenever you hear it thunder."" ",17162,17245
213,"He added, with a sly look, ""That old Island Spirit has a brother down in that part of the country. ",17245,17344
214,"You will prosper in all things, for my daughter is very diligent. ",17344,17410
215,"All the time that you pass in sleep, she will be at work. ",17410,17468
216,The distance is short to your village. ,17468,17507
217,"A path leads directly to it, and when you get there, do not forget my wants as I stated to you before."" ",17507,17611
218,"Wassamo promised obedience to these directions, and, at the appointed time, set out in company with his wife. ",17611,17721
219,"They traveled on a pleasant course, his wife leading the way, until they reached a rising ground. ",17721,17819
220,"At the highest point of this ground, she said, ""We will soon get to your country."" ",17819,17902
221,"It suddenly became broad day, as they came upon a high bank; ",17902,17963
222," they passed, unwet, for a short distance under the lake, and presently emerged from the water at the sand-banks, just off the shore where Wassamo had set his nets on the night when he had been borne away by the two strange females. ",17962,18195
223,"He now left his wife sheltered in a neighboring wood, while he advanced toward the village alone. ",18195,18293
224,"Musing sadly, and from time to time breaking forth in mournful cries, as he walked the shore, it was his cousin that Wassamo beheld as he turned the first point of land by the lake. ",18293,18475
225,With the speed of lightning the cousin rushed forward. ,18475,18530
226,"""Netawis! ",5118,5128
227,"Netawis!"" ",18540,18550
228,"he cried, ""is it indeed you? ",18550,18579
229,"Whence have you come, oh, my cousin?"" ",18579,18617
230,"They fell upon each other's necks, and wept aloud. ",18617,18668
231,"And then, without further delay or question, the cousin ran off with breathless dispatch to the village. ",18668,18773
232,"He seemed like a shadow upon the open ground, he sped so fast. ",18773,18836
233,He entered the lodge where sat the mother of Wassamo in mourning for her son. ,18836,18914
234,"""Hear me,"" said the cousin. ",18914,18942
235,"""I have seen him whom you accuse me of having killed. ",18942,18996
236,"He will be here even while we speak."" ",18996,19034
237,He had scarcely uttered these words when the whole village was astir in an instant. ,19034,19118
238,All ran out and strained their eyes to catch the first view of him whom they had thought dead. ,19118,19213
239,"And when Wassamo came forward, they at first fell from him as though he had been in truth one returned from the Spirit-land. ",19213,19338
240,He entered the lodge of his parents. ,19338,19375
241,"They saw that it was Wassamo, living, breathing and as they had ever known him. ",19375,19455
242,And joy lit up the lodge-circle as though a new fire had been kindled in the eyes of his friends and kinsfolk. ,19455,19566
243,He related all that had happened to him from the moment of his leaving the temporary night-lodge with the flame on his head. ,19566,19691
244,He told them of the strange land in which he had sojourned during his absence. ,19691,19770
245,"He added to his mother, apart from the company, that he was married, and that he had left his wife at a short distance from the village. ",19770,19907
246,She went out immediately in search of her; ,19907,19950
247," they soon found her in the wood, and all the women in the village conducted her in honor to the lodge of her new relations. ",19949,20074
248,"The Indian people were astonished at her beauty, at the whiteness of her skin, and still more, that she was able to talk with them in their own language. ",20074,20228
249,"The village was happy, and the feast went on as long as the supply held out. ",20228,20305
250,All were delighted to make the acquaintance of the old Sand-Spirit's daughter; ,20305,20384
251," and as they had heard that he was a magician and guardian of great power, the tobacco which he had sent for by his son-in-law, came in, in great abundance, with every visitor. ",20383,20560
252,The summer and fall which Wassamo thus passed with his parents and the people of his tribe were prosperous with all the country. ,20560,20689
253,"The cousin of Wassamo recovered heart, and sang once more his sad or mirthful chants, just as the humor was upon him; ",20689,20807
254," but he kept close by Wassamo, and watched him in all his movements. ",20806,20875
255,He made it a point to ask many questions of the country he came from; ,20875,20945
256," some of which his cousin replied to, but others were left entirely in the dark. ",20944,21025
257,"At every thunder-storm, as the old Sand-Spirit had foreboded, the wife of Wassamo disappeared, much to the astonishment of her Indian company, and, to their greater wonder, she was never idle, night nor day. ",21025,21233
258,"When the winter came on, Wassamo prepared for her a comfortable lodge, to which she withdrew for her long sleep; ",21233,21346
259," and he gave notice to his friends that they must not disturb her, as she would not be with them again until the spring returned. ",21345,21475
260,"Before lying down, she said to her husband, ""No one but yourself must pass on this side of the lodge."" ",21475,21578
261,"The winter passed away with snows, and sports and stones in the lodge; ",21578,21649
262," and when the sap of the maple began to flow, the wife of Wassamo wakened, and she immediately set about work as before. ",21648,21769
263,She helped at the maple-trees with the others; ,21769,21816
264," and, as if luck were in her presence, the sugar-harvest was greater than had been ever known in all that region. ",21815,21929
265,"The gifts of tobacco, after this, came in even more freely than they had at first; ",21929,22012
266," and as each brought his bundle to the lodge of Wassamo, he asked for the usual length of life, for success as a hunter, and for a plentiful supply of food. ",22011,22168
267,"They particularly desired that the sand-hills might be kept quiet, so that their lands might be moist, and their eyes clear of dust to sight the game. ",22168,22319
268,Wassamo replied that he would mention each of their requests to his father-in-law. ,22319,22402
269,"The tobacco was stored in sacks, and on the outside of the skins, that there might be no mistake as to their wants, each one who had given tobacco had painted and marked in distinct characters the totem or family emblem of his family and tribe. ",22402,22647
270,"These the old Sand-Spirit could read at his leisure, and do what he thought best for each of his various petitioners. ",22647,22765
271,"When the time for his return arrived, Wassamo warned his people that they should not follow him nor attempt to take note how he disappeared. ",22765,22906
272,"He then took the moose-skin sacks filled with tobacco, and bade farewell to all but Netawis. ",22906,22999
273,"He insisted on the privilege of attending Wassamo and his wife for a distance, and when they reached the sand-banks he expressed the strongest wish to proceed with them on their journey. ",22999,23186
274,Wassamo told him that it could not be; ,23186,23225
275," that only spirits could exert the necessary power, and that there were no such spirits at hand. ",23224,23321
276,"They then took an affectionate leave of each other, Wassamo enjoining it upon his cousin, at risk of his life, to not look back when he had once started to return. ",23321,23485
277,"The cousin, sore at heart, but constrained to obey, parted from them, and as he walked sadly away, he heard a gliding noise as of the sound of waters that were cleaved. ",23485,23654
278,"He returned home, and told his friends that Wassamo and his wife had disappeared, but that he knew not how. ",23654,23762
279,No one doubted his word in any thing now. ,23762,23804
280,Wassamo with his wife soon reached their home at the hills. ,23804,23864
281,"The old Sand-Spirit was in excellent health, and delighted to see them. ",23864,23936
282,He hailed their return with open arms; ,23936,23975
283," and he opened his arms so very wide, that when he closed them he not only embraced Wassamo and his wife, but all of the tobacco-sacks which they had brought with them. ",23974,24143
284,The requests of the Indian people were made known to him; ,24143,24201
285," he replied that he would attend to all, but that he must first invite his friends to smoke with him. ",24200,24302
286,"Accordingly he at once dispatched his pipe-bearer and confidential aid to summon various Spirits of his acquaintance, and set the time for them to come. ",24302,24455
287,Meanwhile he had a word of advice for his son-in-law Wassamo. ,24455,24517
288,"""My son,"" said he, ""some of these Manitoes that I have asked to come here are of a very wicked temper, and I warn you especially of that Island Spirit who wished to marry my daughter. ",24517,24701
289,"He is a very bad-hearted Monedo, and would like to do you harm. ",24701,24765
290,"Some of the company you will, however, find to be very friendly. ",24765,24830
291,A caution for you. ,24830,24849
292,"When they come in, do you sit close by your wife; ",24849,24899
293," if you do not, you will be lost. ",24898,24932
294,She only can save you; ,24932,24955
295," for those who are expected to come are so powerful that they will otherwise draw you from your seat, and toss you out of the lodge as though you were a feather. ",24954,25116
296,"You have only to observe my words and all will be well."" ",25116,25173
297,"Wassamo took heed to what the Old Spirit said, and answered that he would obey. ",25173,25253
298,About mid-day the company began to assemble; ,25253,25298
299, and such a company Wassamo had never looked on before. ,25297,25353
300,There were Spirits from all parts of the country; ,25353,25403
301," such strange-looking persons, and in dresses so wild and outlandish! ",25402,25472
302,One entered who smiled on him. ,25472,25503
303,"This, Wassamo was informed, was a Spirit who had charge of the affairs of a tribe in the North, and he was as pleasant and cheery a Spirit as one would wish to see. ",25503,25668
304,"Soon after, Wassamo heard a great rumbling and roaring, as of waters tumbling over rocks; ",25668,25758
305," and presently, with a vast bluster, and fairly shaking the lodge with his deep-throated hail of welcome to the old Sand-Spirit, in rolled another, who was the Guardian Spirit and special director of a great cataract or water-fall not far off. ",25757,26001
306,"Then came with crashing steps the owner of several whirlwinds, which were in the habit of raging about in the neighboring country. ",26001,26132
307,"And following this one, glided in a sweet-spoken, gentle-faced little Spirit, who was understood to represent a summer-gale that was accustomed to blow, toward evening, in at the lodge-doors, and to be particularly well disposed toward young lovers. ",26132,26382
308,The last to appear was a great rocky-headed fellow; ,26382,26434
309, and he was twice as stony in his manners; ,26433,26476
310," and swaggered and strided in, and raised such a commotion with his great green blanket when he shook it, that Wassamo was nearly taken off his feet; ",26475,26625
311, and it was only by main force that he was able to cling by his wife. ,26624,26694
312,"This, which was the last to enter, was that wicked Island Spirit, who looked grim enough at Wassamo's wife, who had rejected him, as he passed in. ",26694,26841
313,"Soon after, the old Sand-Spirit, who was a great speech-maker, arose and addressed the assembly. ",26841,26938
314,"""Brothers,"" he said, ""I have invited you to partake with me of the offerings made by the mortals on earth, which have been brought by our relation,"" pointing to Wassamo. ",26938,27108
315,"""Brothers, you see their wishes and desires plainly set forth here,"" laying his hand upon the figured moose-skins. ",27108,27223
316,"""The offering is worthy of our consideration. ",27223,27269
317,"Brothers, I see nothing on my part to hinder our granting their requests; ",27269,27343
318, they do not appear to be unreasonable. ,27342,27382
319,"Brothers, the offer is gratifying. ",27382,27417
320,It is tobacco--an article which we have lacked until we scarcely knew how to use our pipes. ,27417,27509
321,Shall we grant their requests? ,27509,27540
322,One thing more I would say. ,27540,27568
323,"Brothers, it is this: There is my son-in law; ",27568,27614
324, he is mortal. ,27613,27628
325,"I wish to detain him with me, and it is with us jointly to make him one of us."" ",27628,27708
326,"""Hoke! ",27708,27715
327,"hoke!"" ",27715,27722
328,"ran through the whole company of Spirits, and ""Hoke! ",27722,27775
329,"hoke!"" ",27715,27722
330,they cried again. ,27782,27800
331,"And it was understood that the petitioners were to have all they asked, and that Wassamo was thenceforward fairly accepted as a member of the great family of Spirits. ",27800,27967
332,"As a wedding-gift, the Old Spirit asked his son-in-law to make one request, which should be promptly granted. ",27967,28077
333,"""Let there be no sand-squalls among my father's people for three months to come,"" said Wassamo. ",28077,28173
334,"""So shall it be,"" answered the old Sand-Spirit. ",28173,28221
335,The tobacco was now divided in equal shares among the company. ,28221,28284
336,"They filled their pipes--and huge pipes they were--and such clouds they blew, that they rushed forth out of the lodge and brought on night, in all the country round about, several hours before its time. ",28284,28487
337,"After a while passed in silence, the Spirits rose up, and bearing off their tobacco-sacks, they went smoking through the country, and losing themselves in their own fog, till a late hour in the morning, when all of their pipes being burned out, each departed on his own business. ",28487,28767
338,"The very next day the old Sand-Spirit, who was very much pleased with the turn affairs had taken at his entertainment, addressed Wassamo: ""Son-in-law, I have made up my mind to allow you another holiday as an acknowledgment of the handsome manner in which you acquitted yourself of your embassy. ",28767,29063
339,"You may visit your parents and relatives once more, to tell them that their wishes are granted, and to take your leave of them forever. ",29063,29199
340,"You can never, after, visit them again."" ",29199,29240
341,"Wassamo at once set out, reached his people, and was heartily welcomed. ",29240,29312
342,"They asked for his wife, and Wassamo informed them that she had tarried at home to look after a son, a fine little Sand-Spirit, who had been born to them since his return. ",29312,29484
343,"Having delivered all of his messages and passed a happy time, Wassamo said, ""I must now bid you all farewell forever."" ",29484,29603
344,His parents and friends raised their voices in loud lamentation; ,29603,29668
345," they clung to him, and as a special favor, which he could now grant, being himself a spirit, he allowed them to accompany him to the sand-banks. ",29667,29813
346,They all seated themselves to watch his last farewell. ,29813,29868
347,The day was mild; ,29868,29886
348," the sky clear, not a cloud appearing to dim the heavens, nor a breath of wind to ruffle the tranquil waters. ",29885,29995
349,A perfect silence fell upon the company. ,29995,30036
350,"They gazed with eager eyes fastened on Wassamo, as he waded out into the water, waving his hands. ",30036,30134
351,"They saw him descend, more and more, into the depths. ",30134,30188
352,"They beheld the waves close over his head, and a loud and piercing wail went up which rent the sky. ",30188,30288
353,They looked again; ,30288,30307
354," a red flame, as if the sun had glanced on a billow, lighted the spot for an instant; ",30306,30392
355," but the Feather of Flames, Wassamo of the Fire-Plume, had disappeared from home and kindred, and the familiar paths of his youth, forever.",30391,30531
