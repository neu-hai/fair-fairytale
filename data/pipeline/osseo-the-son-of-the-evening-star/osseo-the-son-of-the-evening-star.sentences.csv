0,"There once lived an Indian in the north who had ten daughters, all of whom grew up to womanhood. ",0,97
1,"They were noted for their beauty, especially Oweenee, the youngest, who was very independent in her way of thinking. ",97,214
2,"She was a great admirer of romantic places, and spent much of her time with the flowers and winds and clouds in the open air. ",214,340
3,"Though the flower were homely, if it was fragrant--though the wind were rough, if it was healthful--and though the cloud were dark, if it embosomed the fruitful rain, she knew how, in spite of appearances, to acknowledge the good qualities concealed from the eye. ",340,604
4,She paid very little attention to the many handsome young men who came to her father's lodge for the purpose of seeing her. ,604,728
5,"Her elder sisters were all sought in marriage, and one after the other they went off to dwell in the lodges of their husbands; ",728,855
6, but Oweenee was deaf to all proposals of the kind. ,854,906
7,"At last she married an old man called Osseo, who was scarcely able to walk, and who was too poor to have things like others. ",906,1031
8,The only property he owned in the world was the walking-staff which he carried in his hand. ,1031,1123
9,"Though thus poor and homely, Osseo was a devout and good man; ",1123,1185
10," faithful in all his duties, and obedient in all things to the Good Spirit. ",1184,1260
11,"Of course they jeered and laughed at Oweenee on all sides, but she seemed to be quite happy, and said to them, ""It is my choice and you will see in the end who has acted the wisest."" ",1260,1443
12,"They made a special mock of the walking-staff, and scarcely an hour in the day passed that they had not some disparaging reference to it. ",1443,1581
13,"Among themselves they spoke of Osseo of the walking-staff, in derision, as the owner of the big woods, or the great timber-man. ",1581,1709
14,"""True,"" said Oweenee, ""it is but a simple stick; ",1709,1758
15," but as it supports the steps of my husband, it is more precious to me than all the forests of the north."" ",1757,1864
16,"A time came when the sisters, and their husbands, and their parents were all invited to a feast. ",1864,1961
17,"As the distance was considerable, they doubted whether Osseo, so aged and feeble, would be able to undertake the journey; ",1961,2083
18," but in spite of their friendly doubts, he joined them, and set out with a good heart. ",2082,2169
19,As they walked along the path they could not help pitying their young and handsome sister who had such an unsuitable mate. ,2169,2292
20,"She, however, smiled upon Osseo, and kept with him by the way the same as if he had been the comeliest bridegroom in all the company. ",2292,2426
21,Osseo often stopped and gazed upward; ,2426,2464
22," but they could perceive nothing in the direction in which he looked, unless it was the faint glimmering of the evening star. ",2463,2589
23,"They heard him muttering to himself as they went along, and one of the elder sisters caught the words, ""Pity me, my father!"" ",2589,2714
24,"""Poor old man,"" said she; ",2714,2740
25," ""he is talking to his father. ",2739,2770
26,"What a pity it is that he would not fall and break his neck, that our sister might have a young husband."" ",2770,2876
27,"Presently as they came to a great rock where Osseo had been used to breathe his morning and his evening prayer, the star emitted a brighter ray, which shone directly in his face. ",2876,3055
28,"Osseo, with a sharp cry, fell trembling to the earth, where the others would have left him, but his good wife raised him up, and he sprang forward on the path, and with steps light as the reindeer he led the party, no longer decrepid and infirm, but a beautiful young man. ",3055,3328
29,"On turning around to look for his wife, behold she had become changed, at the same moment, into an aged and feeble woman, bent almost double, and walking with the staff which he had cast aside. ",3328,3522
30,"Osseo immediately joined her, and with looks of fondness and the tenderest regard, bestowed on her every endearing attention, and constantly addressed her by the term of ne-ne-moosh-a, or my sweetheart. ",3522,3725
31,"As they walked along, whenever they were not gazing fondly in each other's face, they bent their looks on heaven, and a light, as if of far-off stars, was in their eyes. ",3725,3895
32,"On arriving at the lodge of the hunter with whom they were to feast, they found the banquet ready, and as soon as their entertainer had finished his harangue--in which he told them his feasting was in honor of the Evening or Woman's Star--they began to partake of the portion dealt out, according to age and character, to each one of the guests. ",3895,4241
33,"The food was very delicious, and they were all happy but Osseo, who looked at his wife, and then gazed upward, as if he was looking into the substance of the sky. ",4241,4404
34,"Sounds were soon heard, as if from far-off voices in the air, and they became plainer and plainer, till he could clearly distinguish some of the words. ",4404,4556
35,"""My son, my son,"" said the voice; ",4556,4590
36," ""I have seen your afflictions, and pity your wants. ",4589,4642
37,I come to call you away from a scene that is stained with blood and tears. ,4642,4717
38,The earth is full of sorrows. ,4717,4747
39,"Wicked spirits, the enemies of mankind, walk abroad, and lie in wait to ensnare the children of the sky. ",4747,4852
40,"Every night they are lifting their voices to the Power of Evil, and every day they make themselves busy in casting mischief in the hunter's path. ",4852,4998
41,"You have long been their victim, but you shall be their victim no more. ",4998,5070
42,The spell you were under is broken. ,5070,5106
43,Your evil genius is overcome. ,5106,5136
44,"I have cast him down by my superior strength, and it is this strength I now exert for your happiness. ",5136,5238
45,"Ascend, my son; ",5238,5254
46," ascend into the skies, and partake of the feast I have prepared for you in the stars, and bring with you those you love. ",5253,5375
47,"""The food set before you is enchanted and blessed. ",5375,5426
48,Fear not to partake of it. ,5426,5453
49,"It is endowed with magic power to give immortality to mortals, and to change men to spirits. ",5453,5546
50,Your bowls and kettles shall no longer be wood and earth. ,5546,5604
51,"The one shall become silver, and the other pure gold. ",5604,5658
52,"They shall shine like fire, and glisten like the most beautiful scarlet. ",5658,5731
53,"Every female shall also change her state and looks, and no longer be doomed to laborious tasks. ",5731,5827
54,"She shall put on the beauty of the star-light, and become a shining bird of the air. ",5827,5912
55,"She shall dance, and not work. ",5912,5943
56,"She shall sing, and not cry. ",5943,5972
57,"""My beams,"" continued the voice, ""shine faintly on your lodge, but they have power to transform it into the lightness of the skies, and decorate it with the colors of the clouds. ",5972,6151
58,"Come, Osseo, my son, and dwell no longer on earth. ",6151,6202
59,"Think strongly on my words, and look steadfastly at my beams. ",6202,6264
60,My power is now at its height. ,6264,6295
61,"Doubt not, delay not. ",6295,6317
62,"It is the voice of the Spirit of the Stars that calls you away to happiness and celestial rest."" ",6317,6414
63,"The words were intelligible to Osseo, but his companions thought them some far-off sounds of music, or birds singing in the woods. ",6414,6545
64,"Very soon the lodge began to shake and tremble, and they felt it rising into the air. ",6545,6631
65,"It was too late to run out, for they were already as high as the tops of the trees. ",6631,6715
66,"Osseo looked around him as the lodge passed through the topmost boughs, and behold! ",6715,6799
67,"their wooden dishes were changed into shells of a scarlet color, the poles of the lodge to glittering rods of silver, and the bark that covered them into the gorgeous wings of insects. ",6799,6984
68,"A moment more and his brothers and sisters, and their parents and friends, were transformed into birds of various plumage. ",6984,7107
69,"Some were jays, some partridges and pigeons, and others gay singing birds, who hopped about, displaying their many-colored feathers, and singing songs of cheerful note. ",7107,7276
70,"But his wife, Oweenee, still kept her earthly garb, and exhibited all the indications of extreme old age. ",7276,7382
71,"He again cast his eyes in the direction of the clouds, and uttered the peculiar cry which had given him the victory at the rock. ",7382,7511
72,In a moment the youth and beauty of his wife returned; ,7511,7566
73," her dingy garments assumed the shining appearance of green silk, and her staff was changed into a silver feather. ",7565,7680
74,"The lodge again shook and trembled, for they were now passing through the uppermost clouds, and they immediately after found themselves in the Evening Star, the residence of Osseo's father. ",7680,7870
75,"""My son,"" said the old man, ""hang that cage of birds which you have brought along in your hand at the door, and I will inform you why you and your wife have been sent for."" ",7870,8043
76,"Osseo obeyed, and then took his seat in the lodge. ",8043,8094
77,"""Pity was shown to you,"" resumed the King of the Star, ""on account of the contempt of your wife's sister, who laughed at her ill fortune, and ridiculed you while you were under the power of that wicked spirit whom you overcame at the rock. ",8094,8334
78,"That spirit lives in the next lodge, being the small star you see on the left of mine, and he has always felt envious of my family because we had greater power, and especially that we had committed to us the care of the female world. ",8334,8568
79,"He failed in many attempts to destroy your brothers and sisters-in-law, but succeeded at last in transforming yourself and your wife into decrepid old persons. ",8568,8728
80,"You must be careful and not let the light of his beams fall on you, while you are here, for therein lies the power of his enchantment. ",8728,8863
81,"A ray of light is the bow and arrow he uses."" ",8863,8909
82,"Osseo lived happy and contented in the parental lodge, and in due time his wife presented him with a son, who grew up rapidly, and in the very likeness of Osseo himself. ",8909,9079
83,"He was very quick and ready in learning every thing that was done in his grandfather's dominions, but he wished also to learn the art of hunting, for he had heard that this was a favorite pursuit below. ",9079,9282
84,"To gratify him, his father made him a bow and arrows, and he then let the birds out of the cage that he might practice in shooting. ",9282,9414
85,"In this pastime he soon became expert, and the very first day he brought down a bird; ",9414,9500
86," but when he went to pick it up, to his amazement it was a beautiful young woman, with the arrow sticking in her breast. ",9499,9620
87,It was one of his younger aunts. ,9620,9653
88,"The moment her blood fell upon the surface of that pure and spotless planet, the charm was dissolved. ",9653,9755
89,"The boy immediately found himself sinking, although he was partly upheld by something like wings until he passed through the lower clouds, and he then suddenly dropped upon a high, breezy island in a large lake. ",9755,9967
90,"He was pleased, on looking up, to see all his aunts and uncles following him in the form of birds, and he soon discovered the silver lodge, with his father and mother, descending, with its waving tassels fluttering like so many insects' gilded wings. ",9967,10218
91,"It rested on the loftiest cliffs of the island, and there they fixed their residence. ",10218,10304
92,"They all resumed their natural shapes, but they were diminished to the size of fairies; ",10304,10392
93," and as a mark of homage to the King of the Evening Star, they never failed on every pleasant evening during the summer season to join hands and dance upon the top of the rocks. ",10391,10569
94,"These rocks were quickly observed by the Indians to be covered, in moonlight evenings, with a larger sort of Ininees, or little men, and were called Mish-in-e-mok-in-ok-ong, or Little Spirits, and the island is named from them to this day. ",10569,10809
95,"Their shining lodge can be seen in the summer evenings, when the moon beams strongly on the pinnacles of the rocks; ",10809,10925
96," and the fishermen who go near those high cliffs at night, have even heard the voices of the happy little dancers. ",10924,11039
97,"And Osseo and his wife, as fondly attached to each other as ever, always lead the dance.",11039,11128
