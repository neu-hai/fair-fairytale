2, and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust. ,148,209
3,But one day their mother-Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit-expected friends to tea; ,209,281
4," so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived. ",280,374
5,First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet). ,374,427
6,"Then she brushed their fur, (this one is Mittens). ",427,478

8,"Tom was very naughty, and he scratched. ",541,581
9,Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; ,581,653

11,"Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; ",778,821
12, several buttons burst off. ,820,848
13,His mother sewed them on again. ,848,880
14,"When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast. ",880,1026
15,"""Now keep your frocks clean, children! ",1026,1065
16,You must walk on your hind legs. ,1065,1098

20,When they stood up there were several green smears! ,1330,1382
21,"""Let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall,"" said Moppet. ",1382,1454
22,"They turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; ",1454,1533
23, Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road. ,1532,1580
24,Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. ,1580,1661
25,"He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left. ",1661,1753
26,He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall. ,1753,1811
27,Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; ,1811,1858
28," his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst. ",1857,1911
29,"While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! ",1911,1976
30,"and the three Puddle-Ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-pit pat paddle pat! ",1976,2109
31,pit pat waddle pat! ,2109,2129
32,"They stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. ",2129,2192
33,They had very small eyes and looked surprised. ,2192,2239
34,"Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on. ",2239,2343
35,Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. ,2343,2390
36,Moppet and Tom descended after her; ,2390,2426
37, the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down. ,2425,2500
38,"""Come! ",2500,2507
39,"Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck,"" said Moppet-""Come and help us to dress him! ",2507,2575
40,"Come and button up Tom!"" ",2575,2600
41,"Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles. ",2600,2694
42,But he put them on himself! ,2694,2722
43,They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten. ,2722,2766
44,"""It's a very fine morning!"" ",2766,2794
45,said Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck. ,2794,2822
46,"And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-Duck set off up the road, keeping step-pit pat, paddle pat! ",2822,2920
47,"pit pat, waddle pat! ",2920,2941
48,Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on. ,2941,3038
49,"She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house. ",3038,3115
50,"""My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; ",3115,3184
51," I am affronted,"" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit. ",3183,3229
52,She sent them upstairs; ,3229,3253
53, and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; ,3252,3336
54, which was not true. ,3335,3356
55,Quite the contrary; ,3356,3376
56, they were not in bed: not in the least. ,3375,3416
57,"Somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party. ",3416,3529
58,"And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten! ",3529,3634
59,As for the Puddle-Ducks-they went into a pond. ,3634,3681
60,"The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons. ",3681,3747
