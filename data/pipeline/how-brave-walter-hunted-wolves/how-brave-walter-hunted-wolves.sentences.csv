0,A little back from the high road there stands a house which is called 'Hemgard.' ,0,81
1,"Perhaps you remember the two beautiful mountain ash trees by the reddish-brown palings, and the high gate. ",81,188
2,"Or you remember the garden with the beautiful barberry bushes which are always the first to become grown in spring, and which in summer are weighed down with their beautiful berries. ",188,371
3,Behind the garden there is a hedge with tall aspens which rustle in the morning wind. ,371,457
4,"Behind the hedge is a road, behind the road is a wood, and behind the wood the wide world. ",457,548
5,"But on the other side of the garden there is a lake, and beyond the lake is a village, and all around stretch meadows and fields, now yellow, now green. ",548,701
6,"In the pretty house, which has white window-frames, a neat porch and clean steps, which are always strewn with finely-cut juniper leaves, Walter's parents live. ",701,862
7,"His brother Frederick, his sister Lotta, old Lena, Jonah, Caro and Bravo, Putte and Murre, and Kuckeliku. ",862,968
8,"Caro lives in the dog house, Bravo in the stable, Putte with the stableman, Murre a little here and a little there, and Kuckeliku lives in the hen house, that is his kingdom. ",968,1143
9,"Walter is six years old, and he must soon begin to go to school. ",1143,1208
10,"He cannot read yet, but he can do many other things. ",1208,1261
11,"He can turn cartwheels, stand on his head, ride see-saw, throw snowballs, play ball, crow like a cock, eat bread and butter and drink sour milk, and tear his trousers. ",1261,1429
12,"He can wear holes in his elbows, break the crockery in pieces, throw balls through the windowpanes, draw old men on important papers, walk over the flower-beds, eat himself sick with gooseberries, and be well after a whipping. ",1429,1656
13,"For the rest he has a good heart but a bad memory, and forgets his father's and his mother's admonitions. ",1656,1762
14,"He so often gets into trouble and meets with adventures, as you shall hear, but first of all I must tell you how brave he was and how he hunted wolves. ",1762,1914
15,"Once in the spring, a little before Midsummer, Walter heard that there were a great many wolves in the wood, and that pleased him. ",1914,2045
16,"He was wonderfully brave when he was in the midst of his companions or at home with his brothers and sister, then he used often to say 'One wolf is nothing, there ought to be at least four.' ",2045,2236
17,"When he wrestled with Klas Bogenstrom or Frithiof Waderfelt and struck them in the back, he would say 'That is what I shall do to a wolf!' ",2236,2375
18,When he shot arrows at Jonas and they rattled against his sheepskin coat he would say: 'That is how I should shoot you if you were a wolf!' ,2375,2515
19,"Indeed, some thought that the brave boy boasted a little. ",2515,2573
20,One must indeed believe him since he said so himself. ,2573,2627
21,"So Jonas and Lena used to say of him 'Look, there goes Walter, who shoots the wolves.' ",2627,2714
22,"And other boys and girls would say 'Look, there goes brave Walter, who is brave enough to fight with four.' ",2714,2822
23,"There was no one so fully convinced of this as Walter himself, and one day he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt. ",2822,2939
24,"He took with him his drum, which had holes in one end since the time he had climbed up on it to reach a cluster of rowan berries, and his tin sabre, which was a little broken, because he had with incredible courage fought his way through a whole unfriendly army of gooseberry bushes. ",2939,3223
25,"He did not forget to arm himself quite to the teeth with his pop-gun, his bow, and his air-pistol. ",3223,3322
26,"He had a burnt cork in his pocket to blacken his moustache, and a red cock's feather to put in his cap to make himself look fierce. ",3322,3454
27,"He had besides in his trouser pocket a clasp knife with a bone handle, to cut off the ears of the wolves as soon as he had killed them. ",3454,3590
28,He thought it would be cruel to do that while they were still living. ,3590,3660
29,"It was such a good thing that Jonas was going with corn to the mill, for Walter got a seat on the load, while Caro ran barking beside them. ",3660,3800
30,As soon as they came to the wood Walter looked cautiously around him to see perchance there was a wolf in the bushe. ,3800,3917
31,He did not omit to ask Jonas if wolves were afraid of a drum. ,3917,3979
32,'Of course they are' (that is understood) said Jonas. ,3979,4033
33,Thereupon Walter began to beat his drum with all his might while they were going through the wood. ,4033,4132
34,When they came to the mill Walter immediately asked if there had been any wolves in the neighbourhood lately. ,4132,4242
35,'Alas! ,4242,4249
36,"yes,' said the miller, 'last night the wolves have eaten our fattest ram there by the kiln not far from here.' ",4249,4360
37,'Ah!' ,4360,4366
38,"said Walter, 'do you think that there were many?' ",4366,4416
39,"'We don't know,' answered the miller. ",4416,4454
40,"'Oh, it is all the same,' said Walter. ",4454,4493
41,'I only asked so that I should know if I should take Jonas with me.' ,4493,4562
42,"'I could manage very well alone with three, but if there were more, I might not have time to kill them all before they ran away.' ",4562,4692
43,"'In Walter's place I should go quite alone, it is more manly,' said Jonas. ",4692,4767
44,"'No, it is better for you to come too,' said Walter. ",4767,4820
45,'Perhaps there are many.' ,4820,4846
46,"'No, I have not time,' said Jonas, 'and besides, there are sure not to be more than three. ",4846,4937
47,Walter can manage them very well alone.' ,4937,4978
48,"'Yes,' said Walter, 'certainly I could. ",4978,5018
49,"But, you see, Jonas, it might happen that one of them might bite me in the back, and I should have more trouble in killing them. ",5018,5147
50,"If I only knew that there were not more than two I should not mind, for them I should take one in each hand and give them a good shaking, like Susanna once shook me.' ",5147,5314
51,"'I certainly think that there will not be more than two,' said Jonas, 'there are never more than two when they slay children and rams. ",5314,5449
52,Walter can very well shake them without me.' ,5449,5494
53,"'But, you see, Jonas,' said Walter, 'if there are two, it might still happen that one of them escapes and bites me in the leg. ",5494,5621
54,You see I am not so strong in the left hand as in the right. ,5621,5682
55,"You can very well come with me, and take a good stick in case there are really two. ",5682,5766
56,"Look, if there is only one, I shall take him so with both my hands and thrown him living on to his back. ",5766,5871
57,"He can kick as much as he likes, I shall hold him fast.' ",5871,5928
58,"'Now, when I really think over the thing,' said Jonas, 'I am almost sure there will not be more than one. ",5928,6034
59,What would two do with one ram? ,6034,6066
60,There will certainly not be more than one.' ,6066,6110
61,"'But you should come with me all the same, Jonas,' said Walter. ",6110,6174
62,"'You see I can very well manage one, but I am not quite accustomed to wolves yet, and he might tear holes in my new trousers.' ",6174,6301
63,"'Well, just listen,' said Jonas, 'I am beginning to think that Walter is not so brave as people say. ",6301,6402
64,"First of all Walter would fight against four, and then against three, then two, and then one, and now Walter wants help with one. ",6402,6532
65,Such a thing must never be. ,6532,6560
66,What would people say? ,6560,6583
67,Perhaps they would think that Walter is a coward?' ,6583,6634
68,"'That's a lie,' said Walter, 'I am not at all frightened, but it is more amusing when there are two. ",6634,6735
69,I only want someone who will see how I strike the wolf and how the dust flies out of his skin.' ,6735,6831
70,"'Well, then, Walter can take the miller's little Lisa with him. ",6831,6895
71,"She can sit on a stone and look on,' said Jonas. ",6895,6944
72,"'No, she would certainly be frightened,' said Walter, 'and how would it do for a girl to go wolf-hunting? ",6944,7050
73,"Come with me, Jonas, and you shall have the skin, and I will be content with the ears and the tail.' ",7050,7151
74,"'No, thank you,' said Jonas, 'Walter can keep the skin for himself. ",7151,7219
75,Now I see quite well that he is frightened. ,7219,7263
76,"Fie, shame on him!' ",7263,7283
77,This touched Walter's pride very near. ,7283,7322
78,"'I shall show that I am not frightened,' he said. ",7322,7372
79,"And so he took his drum, sabre, cock's feather, clasp-knife, pop-gun and air-pistol, and went off quite alone to the wood to hunt wolves. ",7372,7510
80,"It was a beautiful evening, and the birds were singing in all the branches. ",7510,7586
81,Walter went very slowly and cautiously. ,7586,7626
82,At every step he looked all round him to see if perchance there was anything lurking behind the stones. ,7626,7730
83,He quite thought something moved away there in the ditch. ,7730,7788
84,Perhaps it was a wolf. ,7788,7811
85,"'It is better for me to beat the drum a little before I go there,' thought Walter. ",7811,7894
86,"Br-r-r, so he began to beat his drum. ",7894,7932
87,Then something moved again. ,7932,7960
88,Caw! ,7960,7965
89,caw! ,7965,7970
90,a crow flew up from the ditch. ,7970,8001
91,Walter immediately regained courage. ,8001,8038
92,"'It was well I took my drum with me,' he thought, and went straight on with courageous steps. ",8038,8132
93,"Very soon he came quite close to the kiln, where the wolves had killed the ram. ",8132,8212
94,But the nearer he came the more dreadful he thought the kiln looked. ,8212,8281
95,It was so gray and old. ,8281,8305
96,Who knew how many wolves there might be hidden there? ,8305,8359
97,Perhaps the very ones which killed the ram were still sitting there in a corner. ,8359,8440
98,"Yes, it was not at all safe here, and there were no other people to be seen in the neighbourhood. ",8440,8538
99,"It would be horrible to be eaten up here in the daylight, thought Walter to himself. ",8538,8623
100,"The more he thought about it the uglier and grayer the old kiln looked, and the more horrible and dreadful it seemed to become the food of wolves. ",8623,8770
101,'Shall I go back and say that I struck one wolf and it escaped?' ,8770,8835
102,thought Walter. ,7878,7894
103,'Fie!' ,8851,8858
104,"said his conscience, 'Do you not remember that a lie is one of the worst sins, both in the sight of God and man? ",8858,8971
105,"If you tell a lie to-day and say you struck a wolf, to-morrow surely it will eat you up.' ",8971,9061
106,"'No, I will go to the kiln,' thought Walter, and so he went. ",9061,9122
107,But he did not go quite near. ,9122,9152
108,"He went only so near that he could see the ram's blood which coloured the grass red, and some tufts of wool which the wolves had torn from the back of the poor animal. ",9152,9320
109,It looked so dreadful. ,9320,9343
110,"'I wonder what the ram thought when they ate him up,' thought Walter to himself. ",9343,9424
111,Just then a cold shiver ran through him from his collar right down to his boots. ,9424,9505
112,"'It is better for me to beat the drum,' he thought to himself again, and so he began to beat it. ",9505,9602
113,"But it sounded horrid, and an echo came out from the kiln that seemed almost like the howl of a wolf. ",9602,9704
114,"The drumsticks stiffened in Walter's hands, and he thought now they are coming...! ",9704,9787
115,"Yes, sure enough, just then a shaggy, reddish-brown wolf's head looked out from under the kiln! ",9787,9883
116,What did Walter do now? ,9883,9907
117,"Yes, the brave Walter who alone could manage four, threw his drum far away, took to his heels and ran. ",9907,10010
118,He ran as fast as he could back to the mill. ,10010,10055
119,"But, alas! ",10055,10066
120,the wolf ran after him. ,10066,10090
121,Walter looked back; ,10090,10110
122, the wolf was quicker than he and only a few steps behind him. ,10109,10172
123,Then Walter ran faster. ,10172,10196
124,"But fear got the better of him, he neither heard nor saw anything more. ",10196,10268
125,"He ran over sticks, stones and ditches. ",10268,10308
126,"He lost drum-sticks, sabre, bow, and air-pistol, and in his terrible hurry he tripped over a tuft of grass. ",10308,10416
127,"There he lay, and the wolf jumped on to him.... ",10416,10464
128,It was a gruesome tale! ,10464,10488
129,Now you may well believe that it was all over with Walter and all his adventures. ,10488,10570
130,That would have been a pity. ,10570,10599
131,"But do not be surprised if it was not quite so bad as that, for the wolf was quite a friendly one. ",10599,10698
132,"He certainly jumped on to Walter, but he only shook his coat and rubbed his nose against his face. ",10698,10797
133,Walter shrieked. ,10797,10814
134,"Yes, he shrieked terribly! ",10814,10841
135,"Happily Jonas heard his cry of distress, for Walter was quite near the mill now, and he ran and helped him up. ",10841,10952
136,'What has happened?' ,10952,10973
137,he asked. ,10973,10983
138,'Why did Walter scream so terribly?' ,10983,11020
139,'A wolf! ,11020,11029
140,A wolf!' ,11029,11038
141,"cried Walter, and that was all he could say. ",11038,11083
142,'Where is the wolf?' ,11083,11104
143,said Jonas. ,4021,4033
144,'I don't see any wolf.' ,11116,11140
145,"'Take care, he is here, he has bitten me to death,' groaned Walter. ",11140,11208
146,Then Jonas began to laugh. ,11208,11235
147,"Yes, he laughed so that he nearly burst his skin belt. ",11235,11290
148,"Well, well, was that the wolf? ",11290,11321
149,"Was that the wolf which Walter was to take by the neck and shake and throw down on its back, no matter how much it struggled? ",11321,11447
150,"Just look a little closer at him: he is your old friend, your own good old Caro. ",11447,11528
151,I quite expect he found a leg of the ram in the kiln. ,11528,11582
152,"When Walter beat his drum, Caro crept out, and when Walter ran away, Caro ran after him, as he so often does when Walter wants to romp and play. ",11582,11727
153,"'Down, Caro! ",11727,11740
154,you ought to be rather ashamed to have put such a great hero to flight!' ,11740,11813
155,Walter got up feeling very foolish. ,11813,11849
156,"'Down, Caro!' ",11849,11863
157,"he said, both relieved and annoyed. ",11863,11899
158,"'It was only a dog, then if it had been a wolf I certainly should have killed him....' 'If Walter would listen to my advice, and boast a little less, and do a little more,' said Jonas, consolingly. ",11899,12097
159,"'Walter is not a coward, is he?' ",12097,12130
160,'I! ,12130,12134
161,"You shall see, Jonas, when we next meet a bear. ",12134,12182
162,You see I like so much better to fight with bears.' ,12182,12234
163,'Indeed!' ,12234,12244
164,laughed Jonas. ,12244,12259
165,'Are you at it again?' ,12259,12282
166,"'Dear Walter, remember that it is only cowards who boast. ",12282,12340
167,A really brave man never talks of his bravery.',12340,12388
