0,"ONCE upon a time there was a peasant who had a wheat-field, which was trampled down every Saturday night. ",0,106
1,"Now the peasant had three sons, and he told each one of them to spend a Saturday night in the field, and to watch and see who trampled it down. ",106,250
2,The oldest was to make the first trial. ,250,290
3,"So he lay down by the upper ridge of the field, and after he had lain there a while he fell asleep. ",290,390
4,"The following morning the whole field had been trampled down, and the young fellow was unable to tell how it had happened. ",390,513
5,Now the second son was to make the attempt; ,513,557
6, but he had the same experience. ,556,589
7,"After he had lain a while he fell asleep, and in the morning he was unable to tell how the field had come to be trampled down. ",589,716
8,Now it was the turn of John by the Ashes. ,716,758
9,He did not lie down by the upper ridge of the field; ,758,811
10," but lower down, and stayed awake. ",810,845
11,"After he had lain there a while, three doves came flying along. ",845,909
12,"They settled in the field, and that very moment shook off all their feathers, and turned into the most beautiful maidens one might wish to see. ",909,1053
13,They danced with each other over the whole field; ,1053,1103
14," and while they did so, the young fellow gathered up all their feathers. ",1102,1175
15,"Toward morning they wanted to put on their feathers again, but could not find them anywhere. ",1175,1268
16,"Then they were frightened, and wept and searched and searched and wept. ",1268,1340
17,"Finally, they discovered the young fellow, and begged him to give them back their feathers. ",1340,1432
18,"""But why do you dance in our wheat-field?"" ",1432,1475
19,said the young fellow. ,1475,1498
20,"""Alas, it is not our fault,"" said the maidens. ",1498,1545
21,"""The troll who has enchanted us sends us here every Saturday night to trample the field. ",1545,1634
22,"But now give us our feathers, for morning is near."" ",1634,1686
23,And they begged for them in the sweetest way. ,1686,1732
24,"""I do not know about that,"" said the young fellow, ""you have trampled down the field so very badly; ",1732,1832
25," perhaps if I might choose and have one of you?"" ",1831,1880
26,"""That would please us,"" returned the maidens, ""but it would not be possible; ",1880,1957
27," for three trolls guard us, one with three, one with six and one with nine heads, and they kill all who come to the mountain."" ",1956,2083
28,"But the young fellow said that one of them pleased him so very much that he would make the attempt, in spite of what they had told him. ",2083,2219
29,"So he chose the middle one, for she seemed the most beautiful to him, and she gave him a ring and put it on his finger. ",2219,2339
30,"And then the maidens at once put on their garments of dove feathers, and flew back across forest and hill. ",2339,2446
31,"When the young fellow returned home, he told what he had seen. ",2446,2509
32,"""And now I must set out and try my luck,"" said he. ",2509,2560
33,"""I do not know whether I will return, but I must make the venture."" ",2560,2628
34,"""O John, John by the Ashes!"" ",2628,2657
35,"said his brothers, and laughed at him. ",2657,2696
36,"""Well, it makes no difference, even though I am worthless,"" said John by the Ashes. ",2696,2780
37,"""I must try my luck."" ",2780,2802
38,So the young fellow set out to wander to the place where the maidens lived. ,2802,2878
39,"They had told him it was farther south than south, and farther north than north, in the great hill of gold. ",2878,2986
40,"After he had gone a while, he met two poor lads who were quarreling with each other about a pair of old shoes and a bamboo cane, which their mother had left them. ",2986,3149
41,"The young fellow said it was not worth quarreling about such things, and that he had better shoes and better canes at home. ",3149,3273
42,"""You cannot say that,"" returned the brothers, ""for whoever has these shoes on can cover a thousand miles in a single step, and whatever is touched with this cane must die at once."" ",3273,3454
43,The young fellow went on to ask whether they would sell the things. ,3454,3522
44,They said that they ought to get a great deal for them. ,3522,3578
45,"""But what you say of them is not true at all,"" the young fellow replied. ",3578,3651
46,"""Yes, indeed, it is absolutely true,"" they answered. ",3651,3704
47,"""Just let me see whether the boots will fit me,"" said the young fellow. ",3704,3776
48,So they let him try them on. ,3776,3805
49,"But no sooner did the young fellow have the boots on his feet, and the cane in his hand, than he took a step and off he was, a thousand miles away. ",3805,3953
50,"A little later he met two young fellows who were quarreling over an old fiddle, which had been left them. ",3953,4059
51,"""Now is that worth while doing?"" ",4059,4092
52,said the young fellow. ,1475,1498
53,"""I have a brand-new fiddle at home."" ",4115,4152
54,"""But I doubt if it has such a tone as ours,"" said one of the youths, ""for if some one is dead, and you play this fiddle, he will come to life again."" ",4152,4302
55,"""That really is a good deal,"" said the young fellow. ",4302,4355
56,"""May I draw the bow across the strings?"" ",4355,4396
57,"They told him he might, but no sooner did he have the fiddle in his hand than he took a step, and suddenly he was a thousand miles away. ",4396,4533
58,"A little later he met an old man, and him he asked whether he knew where the place might be that was ""farther south than south, and farther north than north, and in the great hill of gold."" ",4533,4723
59,"The man said yes, he knew well enough, but it would not do the young fellow much good to get there, for the troll who lived there killed every one. ",4723,4871
60,"""O, I have to make the attempt, whether it lead to life or death,"" said the young fellow, for he was fonder than fond of the middle one of the three maidens. ",4871,5029
61,"So he learned the way from the old man, and finally reached the hill. ",5029,5099
62,"There he had to pass through three rooms, before he came into the hall to the maidens. ",5099,5186
63,"And there were locks on every door, and at each stood a watchman. ",5186,5252
64,"""Where do you want to go?"" ",5252,5279
65,asked the first watchman. ,5279,5305
66,"""In to the maidens,"" said the young fellow. ",5305,5349
67,"""In you may go, but you'll not get out again,"" said the watchman, ""for now the troll will be along before long."" ",5349,5462
68,"But the young fellow said that, at any rate, he would make the attempt, and went on. ",5462,5547
69,So he came to the second watchman. ,5547,5582
70,"""Where do you want to go?"" ",5252,5279
71,asked the latter. ,5609,5627
72,"""In to the maidens,"" said the young fellow. ",5305,5349
73,"""In you may go, but you'll not get out again,"" said the watchman, ""for the troll will be here any minute."" ",5671,5778
74,"""And yet I will make the attempt,"" said the young fellow, and the watchman let him pass. ",5778,5867
75,So he came to the third watchman. ,5867,5901
76,"""Where do you want to go?"" ",5252,5279
77,the latter asked him. ,5928,5950
78,"""In to the maidens,"" said the young fellow. ",5305,5349
79,"""In you may go, but you'll never get out again, for the troll will be here in three shakes of a lamb's tail,"" said the watchman. ",5994,6123
80,"""And yet I will make the attempt,"" said the young fellow, and this watchman also let him pass. ",6123,6218
81,Then he reached the inner chamber where the maidens sat. ,6218,6275
82,"They were so beautiful and distinguished, and the room was so full of gold and silver, that the young fellow never could have imagined anything like it. ",6275,6428
83,"Then he showed the ring, and asked whether the maidens recognized it. ",6428,6498
84,Indeed they did recognize him and the ring. ,6498,6542
85,"""But you poor unfortunate, this is the end of us and of you!"" ",6542,6604
86,said they. ,6604,6615
87,"""The troll with three heads will be along before long, and you had better hide behind the door!"" ",6615,6712
88,"""O, I'm so frightened, I'm so frightened!"" ",6712,6755
89,wailed the maiden whom the young fellow had chosen. ,6755,6807
90,"""Just you stop crying,"" said the young fellow. ",6807,6854
91,"""I think fortune will favor us!"" ",6854,6887
92,The troll came that very moment and thrust his three heads into the door. ,6887,6961
93,"""Uff, it smells like Christian blood here!"" ",6961,7005
94,said he. ,2551,2560
95,"The young fellow struck at the heads with his bamboo cane, and the troll was dead in a minute. ",7014,7109
96,So they carried out the body and hid it. ,7109,7150
97,A little later the troll with six heads came home. ,7150,7201
98,"""Uff, it smells like Christian blood here!"" ",6961,7005
99,said he. ,2551,2560
100,"""some one must have crept into the place! ",7254,7296
101,"But what has become of the other troll?"" ",7296,7337
102,"said he, when he did not see the troll with three heads. ",7337,7394
103,"""He has not yet come home,"" said the maidens. ",7394,7440
104,"""He must have come home,"" said the troll. ",7440,7482
105,"""Perhaps he has gone to look for the fellow who crept in here."" ",7482,7546
106,"At that moment the young fellow struck all six of his heads with his bamboo cane, and the troll at once fell dead to the ground. ",7546,7675
107,Then they dragged out the corpse. ,7675,7709
108,A while later came the troll with nine heads. ,7709,7755
109,"""Uff, it smells like Christian blood here!"" ",6961,7005
110,"said he, and grew very angry. ",7799,7829
111,"""But where are the two others?"" ",7829,7861
112,said he. ,2551,2560
113,"""They have not yet come home,"" said the maidens. ",7870,7919
114,"""Indeed they have come,"" said the troll, ""but they are probably looking for the Christian who has crept in here!"" ",7919,8033
115,"At that moment, the young fellow sprang from behind the door, and struck one head after another with his bamboo cane. ",8033,8151
116,"But he had no more than reached the eighth than it seemed to him that the troll was getting the upper hand, and he ran out of the door. ",8151,8287
117,The troll was so furious that he came near bursting. ,8287,8340
118,"He seized all the maidens and killed them, and then out he flew after the young fellow. ",8340,8428
119,"The latter had hidden behind a big rock, and when the troll came darting up, showering sparks in his rage, he struck at his ninth head, too, and the troll fell on his back, dead. ",8428,8607
120,"Then the young fellow ran in again, took his fiddle and played, and all the maidens came back to life. ",8607,8710
121,Now they wanted to go home; ,8710,8738
122, but did not know how to find the long road back. ,8737,8787
123,"""I know what we must do,"" said the young fellow, ""I will take you on my back, one by one, and then the journey will not be long for us."" ",8787,8924
124,And this he did. ,8924,8941
125,"He carried home all the gold and silver he found in the hill, and then celebrated his wedding with the middle one of the maidens, and if they have not died, they are living this very day.",8941,9129
