2,"During the winter he did not work, but traveled from one fair to another, hunting up quarrels and brawls. ",137,243
3,"From Christiansmarkt he went to Branaes and Konigsberg, and thence to Grundsaet, and wherever he came squabbles and brawls broke out, and in every brawl he was the victor. ",243,415
4,"In the summer he dealt in cattle at Valders and the fjords, and fought with the fjord-folk and the hill people of Halling and Valders, and always had the best of it. ",415,581
5,"But sometimes they scratched him a bit with the knife, did those folk. ",581,652

7,"And he was taken into the hill, which happened in the following way: A man with a pair of gilded goat's horns came along and butted Ola, but Ola fell upon him so that the man had to duck back, again and again. ",792,1002
8,"But the stranger stood up once more, and began to butt again. ",1002,1064
