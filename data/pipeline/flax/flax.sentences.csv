0,THE flax was in full bloom. ,0,28
1,"It had pretty little blue flowers, as delicate as the wings of a moth. ",28,99
2,The sun shone on it and the showers watered it. ,99,147
3,This was as good for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mothers. ,147,253
4,"They look much prettier for it, and so did the flax. ",253,306
5,"""People say that I look exceedingly well,"" said the flax, ""and that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen. ",306,442
6,How fortunate I am! ,442,462
7,It makes me so happy to know that something can be made of me. ,462,525
8,"How the sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain! ",525,595
9,My happiness overpowers me! ,595,623
10,"No one in the world can feel happier than I."" ",623,669
11,"""Ah, yes, no doubt,"" said the fern, ""but you do not know the world yet as well as I do, for my sticks are knotty"";",669,783
12," and then it sang quite mournfully: ""Snip, snap, snurre, Basse lurre. ",783,853
13,"The song is ended."" ",853,873
14,"""No, it is not ended,"" said the flax. ",873,911
15,"""To-morrow the sun will shine or the rain descend. ",911,962
16,I feel that I am growing. ,962,988
17,I feel that I am in full blossom. ,988,1022
18,"I am the happiest of all creatures, for I may some day come to something."" ",1022,1097
19,"Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax and pulled it up by the roots, which was very painful. ",1097,1210
20,"Then it was laid in water, as if it were to be drowned, and after that placed near a fire, as if it were to be roasted. ",1210,1330
21,All this was very shocking. ,1330,1358
22,"""We cannot expect to be happy always,"" said the flax. ",1358,1412
23,"""By experiencing evil as well as good we become wise."" ",1412,1467
24,And certainly there was plenty of evil in store for the flax. ,1467,1529
25,"It was steeped, and roasted, and broken, and combed. ",1529,1582
26,"Indeed, it scarcely knew what was done to it. ",1582,1628
27,At last it was put on the spinning wheel. ,1628,1670
28,"""Whir, whir,"" went the wheel, so quickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts. ",1670,1757
29,"""Well, I have been very happy,"" it thought in the midst of its pain, ""and must be contented with the past."" ",1757,1865
30,"And contented it remained, till it was put on the loom and became a beautiful piece of white linen. ",1865,1965
31,"All the flax, even to the last stalk, was used in making this one piece. ",1965,2038
32,"""Well, this is quite wonderful,"" said the flax. ",2038,2086
33,"""I could not have believed that I should be so favored by fortune. ",2086,2153
34,"The fern was not wrong when it sang, 'Snip, snap, snurre, Basse lurre.' ",2153,2225
35,"But the song is not ended yet, I am sure. ",2225,2267
36,It is only just beginning. ,2267,2294
37,"How wonderful it is that, after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last! ",2294,2379
38,I am the luckiest person in the world--so strong and fine. ,2379,2438
39,And how white and long I am! ,2438,2467
40,This is far better than being a mere plant and bearing flowers. ,2467,2531
41,"Then I had no attention, nor any water unless it rained. ",2531,2588
42,Now I am watched and cared for. ,2588,2620
43,"Every morning the maid turns me over, and I have a shower bath from the watering-pot every evening. ",2620,2720
44,"Yes, and the clergyman's wife noticed me and said I was the best piece of linen in the whole parish. ",2720,2821
45,"I cannot be happier than I am now."" ",2821,2857
46,"After some time the linen was taken into the house, and there cut with the scissors and torn into pieces and then pricked with needles. ",2857,2993
47,"This certainly was not pleasant, but at last it was made into twelve garments of the kind that everybody wears. ",2993,3105
48,"""See now, then,"" said the flax, ""I have become something of importance. ",3105,3177
49,This was my destiny. ,3177,3198
50,It is quite a blessing. ,3198,3222
51,"Now I shall be of some use in the world, as every one ought to be. ",3222,3289
52,It is the only way to be happy. ,3289,3321
53,"I am now divided into twelve pieces, and yet the whole dozen is all one and the same. ",3321,3407
54,"It is most extraordinary good fortune."" ",3407,3447
55,"Years passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it could scarcely hold together. ",3447,3533
56,"""It must end very soon,"" said the pieces to each other. ",3533,3589
57,"""We would gladly have held together a little longer, but it is useless to expect impossibilities."" ",3589,3688
58,"And at length they fell into rags and tatters and thought it was all over with them, for they were torn to shreds and steeped in water and made into a pulp and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselves beautiful white paper. ",3688,3949
59,"""Well, now, this is a surprise--a glorious surprise too,"" said the paper. ",3949,4023
60,"""Now I am finer than ever, and who can tell what fine things I may have written upon me? ",4023,4112
61,"This is wonderful luck!"" ",4112,4137
62,"And so it was, for the most beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it, and only once was there a blot, which was remarkable good fortune. ",4137,4283
63,"Then people heard the stories and poetry read, and it made them wiser and better; ",4283,4365
64," for all that was written had a good and sensible meaning, and a great blessing was contained in it. ",4364,4465
65,"""I never imagined anything like this when I was only a little blue flower growing in the fields,"" said the paper. ",4465,4579
66,"""How could I know that I should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to men? ",4579,4667
67,"I cannot understand it myself, and yet it is really so. ",4667,4723
68,Heaven knows that I have done nothing myself but what I was obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation; ,4723,4842
69, and yet I have been promoted from one joy and honor to another. ,4841,4906
70,"Each time I think that the song is ended, and then something higher and better begins for me. ",4906,5000
71,"I suppose now I shall be sent out to journey about the world, so that people may read me. ",5000,5090
72,"It cannot be otherwise, for I have more splendid thoughts written upon me than I had pretty flowers in olden times. ",5090,5206
73,"I am happier than ever."" ",5206,5231
74,But the paper did not go on its travels. ,5231,5272
75,"It was sent to the printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in type to make a book,--or rather many hundreds of books,--for many more persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book than from the written paper; ",5272,5510
76," and if the paper had been sent about the world, it would have been worn out before it had half finished its journey. ",5509,5627
77,"""Yes, this is certainly the wisest plan,"" said the written paper; ",5627,5693
78," ""I really did not think of this. ",5692,5726
79,"I shall remain at home and be held in honor like some old grandfather, as I really am to all these new books. ",5726,5836
80,They will do some good. ,5836,5860
81,"I could not have wandered about as they can, yet he who wrote all this has looked at me as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface. ",5860,5999
82,"I am the most honored of all."" ",5999,6030
83,Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers and thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse. ,6030,6135
84,"""After work, it is well to rest,"" said the paper, ""and a very good opportunity to collect one's thoughts. ",6135,6241
85,"Now I am able, for the first time, to learn what is in me; ",6241,6300
86, and to know one's self is true progress. ,6299,6341
87,"What will be done with me now, I wonder? ",6341,6382
88,No doubt I shall still go forward. ,6382,6417
89,"I have always progressed hitherto, I know quite well."" ",6417,6472
90,Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken out and laid on the hearth to be burned. ,6472,6577
91,"People said it could not be sold at the shop, to wrap up butter and sugar, because it had been written upon. ",6577,6686
92,"The children in the house stood round the hearth to watch the blaze, for paper always flamed up so prettily, and afterwards, among the ashes, there were so many red sparks to be seen running one after the other, here and there, as quick as the wind. ",6686,6936
93,"They called it seeing the children come out of school, and the last spark, they said, was the schoolmaster. ",6936,7044
94,"They would often think the last spark had come, and one would cry, ""There goes the schoolmaster,"" but the next moment another spark would appear, bright and beautiful. ",7044,7212
95,How they wanted to know where all the sparks went to! ,7212,7266
96,Perhaps they will find out some day. ,7266,7303
97,The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire and was soon burning. ,7303,7379
98,"""Ugh!"" ",7379,7386
99,cried the paper as it burst into a bright flame; ,7386,7435
100," ""ugh!"" ",7434,7442
101,It was certainly not very pleasant to be burned. ,7442,7491
102,"But when the whole was wrapped in flames, the sparks mounted up into the air, higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its little blue flowers, and they glistened as the white linen never could have glistened. ",7491,7709
103,"All the written letters became quite red in a moment, and all the words and thoughts turned to fire. ",7709,7810
104,"""Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,"" said a voice in the flames; ",7810,7882
105, and it was as if a thousand voices echoed the words as the flames darted up through the chimney and went out at the top. ,7881,8003
106,"Then a number of tiny beings, as many as the flowers on the flax had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above the children. ",8003,8136
107,They were even lighter and more delicate than the blue flowers from which they were born; ,8136,8226
108," and as the flames died out and nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings danced upon it, and wherever they touched it, bright red sparks appeared. ",8225,8398
109,"""The children are all out of school, and the schoolmaster was the last of all,"" said the children. ",8398,8497
110,"It was good fun, and they sang over the dead ashes: ""Snip, snap, snurre, Basse lurre. ",8497,8583
111,"The song is ended."" ",853,873
112,"But the little invisible beings said, ""The song is never ended; ",8603,8667
113," the most beautiful is yet to come."" ",8666,8703
114,But the children could neither hear nor understand this; ,8703,8760
115," nor should they, for children must not know everything.",8759,8816
