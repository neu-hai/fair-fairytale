0,"Little Miss Muffet's father was a big banker in a big city, and he had so much money that the house he lived in was almost as beautiful as a king's palace. ",0,156
1,"It was built of granite and marble, and richly furnished with every luxury that money can buy. ",156,251
2,"There was an army of servants about the house, and many of them had no other duties than to wait upon Miss Muffet, for the little girl was an only child and therefore a personage of great importance. ",251,451
3,"She had a maid to dress her hair and a maid to bathe her, a maid to serve her at table and a maid to tie her shoestrings, and several maids beside. ",451,599
4,And then there was Nurse Holloweg to look after all the maids and see they did their tasks properly. ,599,700
5,The child's father spent his days at his office and his evenings at his club; ,700,778
6," her mother was a leader in society, and therefore fully engaged from morning till night and from night till morn; ",777,892
7, so that Little Miss Muffet seldom saw her parents and scarce knew them when she did see them. ,891,986
8,I have never known by what name she was christened. ,986,1038
9,"Perhaps she did not know herself, for everyone had called her ""Miss Muffet"" since she could remember. ",1038,1140
10,The servants spoke of her respectfully as Miss Muffet. ,1140,1195
11,"Mrs. Muffet would say, at times, ""By the way, Nurse, how is Miss Muffet getting along?"" ",1195,1283
12,"And Mr. Muffet, when he met his little daughter by chance on the walk or in the hallway, would stop and look at her gravely and say, ""So this is Miss Muffet. ",1283,1441
13,"Well, how are you feeling, little one?"" ",1441,1481
14,"And then, without heeding her answer, he would walk away. ",1481,1539
15,"Perhaps you think that Miss Muffet, surrounded by every luxury and with a dozen servants to wait upon her, was happy and contented; ",1539,1671
16, but such was not the case. ,1670,1698
17,"She wanted to run and romp, but they told her it was unladylike; ",1698,1763
18," she wished to play with other children, but none were rich enough to be proper associates for her; ",1762,1862
19," she longed to dig in the dirt in the garden, but Nurse Holloweg was shocked at the very thought. ",1861,1959
20,"So Miss Muffet became sullen and irritable, and scolded everyone about her, and lived a very unhappy life. ",1959,2066
21,"And her food was too rich and gave her dyspepsia, so that she grew thin and pale and did not sleep well at night. ",2066,2180
22,"One afternoon her mother, who happened to be at home for an hour, suddenly thought of her little daughter; ",2180,2287
23, so she rang the bell and asked for Nurse Holloweg. ,2286,2338
24,"""How is Miss Muffet, Nurse?"" ",2338,2367
25,enquired the lady. ,2367,2386
26,"""Very badly, ma'am,"" was the reply. ",2386,2422
27,"""Badly! ",2422,2430
28,What do you mean? ,2430,2448
29,"Is she ill?"" ",2448,2461
30,"""She's far from well, ma'am,"" answered the Nurse, ""and seems to be getting worse every day."" ",2461,2554
31,"""Well,"" replied the lady; ",2554,2580
32," ""you must have the doctor to see her; ",2579,2618
33, and don't forget to let me know what he says. ,2617,2664
34,"That is all, Nurse."" ",2664,2685
35,"She turned to her novel again, and the Nurse walked away and sent a servant for the doctor. ",2685,2777
36,"That great man, when he came, shook his head solemnly and said, ""She must have a change. ",2777,2866
37,"Take her away into the country as soon as possible."" ",2866,2919
38,"""And very good advice it was, too,"" remarked the Nurse to one of the maids; ",2919,2995
39," ""for I feel as if I needed a change myself."" ",2994,3040
40,"When she reported the matter to Mrs. Muffet the mother answered, ""Very well; ",3040,3117
41," I will see Mr. Muffet and have him write out a cheque."" ",3116,3173
42,"And so it was that a week later Little Miss Muffet went to the country, or rather to a small town where there was a summer hotel that had been highly recommended to Nurse Holloweg; ",3173,3354
43, and with her went the string of maids and a wagon-load of boxes and trunks. ,3353,3430
44,The morning after their arrival the little girl asked to go out upon the lawn. ,3430,3509
45,"""Well,"" replied Nurse Holloweg, ""Sarah can take you out for half an hour. ",3509,3583
46,"But remember you are not to run and get heated, for that will ruin your complexion; ",3583,3667
47," and you must not speak to any of the common children you meet, for your mother would object; ",3666,3760
48," and you must not get your shoes dusty nor your dress soiled, nor disobey Sarah in any way."" ",3759,3852
49,Little Miss Muffet went out in a very angry and sulky mood. ,3852,3912
50,"""What's the use of being in the country,"" she thought, ""if I must act just as I did in the city? ",3912,4009
51,"I hate Nurse Holloweg, and Sarah, and all the rest of them! ",4009,4069
52,"and if I dared I'd just-just run away."" ",4069,4109
53,"Indeed, a few minutes later, when Sarah had fallen asleep upon a bench under a big shade tree, Miss Muffet decided she would really run away for once in her life, and see how it seemed. ",4109,4295
54,"There was a pretty lane near by, running between shady trees far out into the country, and, stealing softly away from Sarah's side, the little girl ran as fast as she could go, and never stopped until she was all out of breath. ",4295,4523
55,"While she rested and wondered what she could do next, a farmer came along, driving an empty cart. ",4523,4621
56,"""I'll catch on behind,"" said Miss Muffet, gleefully, ""just as I've seen the boys do in the city. ",4621,4718
57,"Won't it be fun!"" ",4718,4736
58,"So she ran and caught on the end of the cart, and actually climbed into it, falling all in a heap upon the straw that lay upon the bottom. ",4736,4875
59,"But it didn't hurt her at all, and the next minute the farmer whipped up his horses, and they went trotting along the lane, carrying Miss Muffet farther and farther away from hated Nurse Holloweg and the dreadful maids. ",4875,5095
60,"She looked around upon the green fields and the waving grain, and drew in deep breaths of the fresh country air, and was happy for almost the first time in her little life. ",5095,5268
61,By and by she lay back upon the straw and fell asleep; ,5268,5323
62," and the farmer, who did not know she was in his cart, drove on for many miles, until at last he stopped at a small wooden farm-house, and jumped to the ground. ",5322,5483
63,"A woman came to the door to greet him, and he said to her, ""Well, mother, we're home again, you see."" ",5483,5585
64,"""So I see,"" she answered; ",5585,5611
65," ""but did you bring my groceries?"" ",5610,5645
66,"""Yes,"" he replied, as he began to unharness the horses; ",5645,5701
67," ""they are in the cart."" ",5700,5725
68,"So she came to the cart and looked within, and saw Miss Muffet, who was still asleep. ",5725,5811
69,"""Where did you get the little girl?"" ",5811,5848
70,"asked the farmer's wife, in surprise. ",5848,5886
71,"""What little girl?"" ",5886,5906
72,asked he. ,5906,5916
73,"""The one in the cart."" ",5916,5939
74,"He came to the cart and looked in, and was as surprised as his wife. ",5939,6008
75,"""She must have climbed into the cart when I left the town,"" he said; ",6008,6077
76," ""but waken her, wife, and we will hear what she has to say."" ",6076,6138
77,"So the farmer's wife shook the girl by the arm, and Miss Muffet sat up in the cart and rubbed her eyes and wondered where she was. ",6138,6269
78,"""How came you in my cart?"" ",6269,6296
79,asked the farmer. ,6296,6314
80,"""I caught on behind, and climbed in,"" answered the girl. ",6314,6371
81,"""What is your name, and where do you live?"" ",6371,6415
82,enquired the farmer's wife. ,6415,6443
83,"""My name is Miss Muffet, and I live in a big city,-but where, I do not know."" ",6443,6521
84,"And that was all she could tell them, so the woman said at last, ""We must keep her till some one comes to claim her, and she can earn her living by helping me make the cheeses."" ",6521,6699
85,"""That will be nice,"" said Miss Muffet, with a laugh, ""for Nurse Holloweg never lets me do anything, and I should like to help somebody do something."" ",6699,6849
86,"So they led her into the house, where the farmer's wife wondered at the fine texture of her dress and admired the golden chain that hung around her neck. ",6849,7003
87,"""Some one will surely come for her,"" the woman said to her husband, ""for she is richly dressed and must belong to a family of some importance."" ",7003,7147
88,"Nevertheless, when they had eaten dinner, for which Little Miss Muffet had a wonderful appetite, the woman took her into the dairy and told her how she could assist her in curdling the milk and preparing it for the cheese-press. ",7147,7376
89,"""Why, it's really fun to work,"" said the girl, at first, ""and I should like to live here always. ",7376,7473
90,"I do hope Nurse Holloweg will not find me."" ",7473,7517
91,"After a time, however, she grew weary, and wanted to rest; ",7517,7576
92," but the woman had not yet finished her cheese-making, so she bade the girl keep at her tasks. ",7575,7670
93,"""It's time enough to rest when the work is done,"" she said, ""and if you stay with me you must earn your board. ",7670,7781
94,"No one is allowed to idle in this house."" ",7781,7823
95,"So Little Miss Muffet, though she felt like crying and was very tired, kept at her work until at length all was finished and the last cheese was in the press. ",7823,7982
96,"""Now,"" said the farmer's wife, ""since you have worked so well I shall give you a dish of curds and whey for your supper, and you may go out into the orchard and eat it under the shade of the trees."" ",7982,8181
97,"Little Miss Muffet had never eaten curds and whey before, and did not know how they tasted; ",8181,8273
98," but she was very hungry, so she took the dish and went into the orchard. ",8272,8346
99,"She first looked around for a place to sit down, and finally discovered a little grassy mound, which is called a tuffet in the country, and seated herself upon it. ",8346,8510
100,Then she tasted the curds and whey and found them very good. ,8510,8571
101,"But while she was eating she chanced to look down at her feet, and there was a great black spider coming straight towards her. ",8571,8698
102,"The girl had never seen such an enormous and hideous-looking spider before, and she was so frightened that she gave a scream and tipped backward off the tuffet, spilling the curds and whey all over her dress as she did so. ",8698,8921
103,"This frightened her more than ever, and as soon as she could get upon her feet she scampered away to the farm-house as fast as she could go, crying bitterly as she ran. ",8921,9090
104,"The farmer's wife tried to comfort her, and Miss Muffet, between her sobs, said she had seen ""the awfulest, biggest, blackest spider in all the world!"" ",9090,9242
105,"This made the woman laugh, for she was not afraid of spiders. ",9242,9304
106,Soon after they heard a sound of wheels upon the road and a handsome carriage came dashing up to the gate. ,9304,9411
107,"""Has anyone seen a little girl who has run away?"" ",9411,9461
108,"asked Nurse Holloweg, leaning out of the carriage. ",9461,9512
109,"""Oh, yes,"" answered Little Miss Muffet; ",9512,9552
110," ""here I am, Nurse."" ",9551,9572
111,"And she ran out and jumped into the carriage, for she was very glad to get back again to those who would care for her and not ask her to work making cheeses. ",9572,9730
112,"When they were driving back to the town the Nurse said, ""You must promise me, Miss Muffet, never to run away again. ",9730,9846
113,"You have frightened me nearly into hysterics, and had you been lost your mother would have been quite disappointed."" ",9846,9963
114,The little girl was silent for a time; ,9963,10002
115," then she answered, ""I will promise not to run away if you will let me play as other children do. ",10001,10099
116,"But if you do not allow me to run and romp and dig in the ground, I shall keep running away, no matter how many horrid spiders come to frighten me!"" ",10099,10248
117,"And Nurse Holloweg, who had really been much alarmed at so nearly losing her precious charge, thought it wise to agree to Miss Muffet's terms. ",10248,10391
118,"She kept her word, too, and when Little Miss Muffet went back to her home in the city her cheeks were as red as roses and her eyes sparkled with health. ",10391,10544
119,"And she grew, in time, to be a beautiful young lady, and as healthy and robust as she was beautiful. ",10544,10645
120,"Seeing which, the doctor put an extra large fee in his bill for advising that the little girl be taken to the country; ",10645,10764
121, and Mr. Muffet paid it without a word of protest. ,10763,10814
122,"Even after Miss Muffet grew up and was married she never forgot the day that she ran away, nor the curds and whey she ate for her supper, nor the great spider that frightened her away from the tuffet.",10814,11015
