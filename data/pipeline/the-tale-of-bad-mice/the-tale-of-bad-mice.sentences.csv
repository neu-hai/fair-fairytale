0,ONCE upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's house; ,0,58
1," it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney. ",57,159
2,IT belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; ,159,209
3," at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals. ",208,271
4,Jane was the Cook; ,271,290
5," but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings. ",289,395
6,"THERE were two red lobsters, and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges. ",395,482
7,"They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful. ",482,553
8,ONE morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator. ,553,635
9,"There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. ",635,691
10,"Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board. ",691,829
11,"Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again. ",829,899
12,Tom Thumb was a mouse. ,899,922
13,"A MINUTE afterwards Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; ",922,988
14," and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box. ",987,1096
15,THE doll's house stood at the other side of the fireplace. ,1096,1155
16,Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearth-rug. ,1155,1220
17,They pushed the front door--it was not fast. ,1220,1265
18,TOM THUMB and Hunca Munca went up-stairs and peeped into the dining-room. ,1265,1339
19,Then they squeaked with joy! ,1339,1368
20,Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! ,1368,1418
21,"There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient! ",1418,1509
22,TOM THUMB set to work at once to carve the ham. ,1509,1557
23,"It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red. ",1557,1609
24,The knife crumpled up and hurt him; ,1609,1645
25, he put his finger in his mouth. ,1644,1677
26,"""It is not boiled enough; ",1677,1703
27, it is hard. ,1702,1715
28,"You have a try, Hunca Munca."" ",1715,1745
29,"HUNCA MUNCA stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife. ",1745,1828
30,"""It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's,"" said Hunca Munca. ",1828,1896
31,"THE ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table. ",1896,1965
32,"""Let it alone,"" said Tom Thumb; ",1965,1997
33," ""give me some fish, Hunca Munca!"" ",1996,2031
34,HUNCA MUNCA tried every tin spoon in turn; ,2031,2074
35, the fish was glued to the dish. ,2073,2106
36,Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. ,2106,2138
37,"He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash, smash! ",2138,2254
38,"The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster! ",2254,2351
39,THEN there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca. ,2351,2434
40,"They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears, and the oranges. ",2434,2503
41,"As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; ",2503,2609
42, but it would not burn either. ,2608,2639
43,TOM THUMB went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top--there was no soot. ,2639,2723
44,"WHILE Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment. ",2723,2799
45,"She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labeled ""Rice,"" ""Coffee"" ""Sago"";",2799,2879
46, but when she turned them upside down there was nothing inside except red and blue beads. ,2879,2969
47,THEN those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially Tom Thumb! ,2969,3054
48,"He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top-floor window. ",3054,3168
49,But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. ,3168,3203
50,"After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather-bed. ",3203,3323
51,WITH Tom Thumb's assistance she carried the bolster down-stairs and across the hearth-rug. ,3323,3414
52,It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole; ,3414,3475
53, but they managed it somehow. ,3474,3504
54,"THEN Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a bookcase, a bird-cage, and several small odds and ends. ",3504,3610
55,The bookcase and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole. ,3610,3676
56,"HUNCA MUNCA left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle. ",3676,3747
57,"HUNCA MUNCA was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. ",3747,3867
58,"The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery. ",3867,3940
59,WHAT a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda! ,3940,3987
60,"Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared, and Jane leaned against the kitchen dresser and smiled; ",3987,4096
61, but neither of them made any remark. ,4095,4133
62,THE bookcase and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal-box; ,4133,4202
63, but Hunca Munca has got the cradle and some of Lucinda's clothes. ,4201,4268
64,"SHE also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things. ",4268,4334
65,"THE little girl that the doll's house belonged to said: ""I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!"" ",4334,4436
66,"BUT the nurse said: ""I will set a mouse-trap!"" ",4436,4483
67,SO that is the story of the two Bad Mice. ,4483,4525
68,"But they were not so very, very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke. ",4525,4624
69,He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; ,4624,4674
70, and upon Christmas Eve he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane. ,4673,4774
71,AND very early every morning--before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!,4774,4908
