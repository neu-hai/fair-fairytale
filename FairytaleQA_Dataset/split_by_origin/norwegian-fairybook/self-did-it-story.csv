1,"Once upon a time there was a mill, in which it was impossible to grind
flour, because such strange things kept happening there. But there was a
poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening, and she
asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during
the night. ""For heaven's sake,"" said the mill-owner, ""that is quite
impossible! There are ghosts enough in the mill as it is."" But the woman
said that she must grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour
in the house with which to make mush, and there was nothing for her
children to eat. So at last he allowed her to go to the mill at night
and grind some flour. When she came, she lit a fire under a big
tar-barrel that was standing there; got the mill going, sat down by the
fire, and began to knit. After a time a girl came in and nodded to her.
""Good evening!"" said she to the woman. ""Good evening!"" said the woman;
kept her seat, and went on knitting. But then the girl who had come in
began to pull apart the fire on the hearth. The woman built it up again."
2,"""What is your name?"" asked the girl from underground.

""Self is my name,"" said the woman.

That seemed a curious name to the girl, and she once more began to pull
the fire apart. Then the woman grew angry and began to scold, and built
it all up again. Thus they went on for a good while; but at last, while
they were in the midst of their pulling apart and building up of the
fire, the woman upset the tar-barrel on the girl from underground. Then
the latter screamed and ran away, crying:

""Father, father! Self burned me!""

""Nonsense, if self did it, then self must suffer for it!"" came the
answer from below the hill."
