1,"John Blessom once upon a time had gone down to Copenhagen to carry on a
suit at law, for in those days one could not get justice in the land of
Norroway; and if a man wanted his rights, there was nothing left for him
to do but to travel to Copenhagen. This is what Blessom had done, and
what his son did after him, for he, too, carried on a law-suit. Now it
chanced that on Christmas Eve John had had speech with the gentleman in
authority, and had attended to his business, and was going along the
street in a low-spirited manner, for he was homesick. And as he went
along, a man from Vaage, in a white blouse, with a knapsack, and buttons
as big as silver dollars, passed him. He was a large, heavily-built man.
It seemed to Blessom that he must know him; but he was walking very
fast."
2,"""You are walking very fast,"" said John.

""Yes, but then I'm in a hurry,"" answered the man. ""I have to get back to
Vaage this very evening.""

""I only wish that I could get there!"" sighed John.

""You can stand on the runner of my sledge,"" said the man, ""for I have a
horse that covers a mile in twelve steps.""

So they set out, and Blessom had all that he could do to hold fast to
the runner of the sledge; for they went through weather and wind, and he
could see neither heaven nor earth.

Once they stopped and rested. He could not tell exactly where it was,
but when they began to hurry on again, he thought that he spied a skull
on a pole. After they had gone on a while, John Blessom began to freeze."
3,"""Alas, I forgot one of my gloves where we stopped, and now my hand is
freezing!"" said he.

""Well, Blessom, you'll have to make the best of it,"" said the man. ""We
are not far from Vaage now. When we stopped to rest we had covered half
the way.""

When they crossed the Finnebridge, the man stopped and set John down.

""Now you are not far from home,"" said he, ""but you must promise me that
you will not look around, when you hear a roaring and notice a flare of
light."""
4,"John promised, and thanked him for the quick journey. The man drove off
on his way, and John crossed the hill to his home. As he went he heard
a roaring in the Jutulsberg, and the path before him suddenly grew so
bright that one could have picked a needle from the ground. And he
forgot what he had promised, and turned his head to see what was
happening. There stood the giant gate of the Jutulsberg wide open, and
out of it streamed a light and radiance as of thousands of candles. In
the midst of it all stood the giant, and he was the man with whom he
had driven. But from that time forward John's head was twisted, and so
it remained as long as he lived."
