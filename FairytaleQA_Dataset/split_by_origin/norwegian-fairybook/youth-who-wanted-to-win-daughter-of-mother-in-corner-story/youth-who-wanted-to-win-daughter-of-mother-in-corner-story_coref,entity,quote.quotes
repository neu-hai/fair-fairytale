3	135	148	148	she	136	1,"Once upon a time there was a woman who had a son . He was so lazy and slow that there was not a single blessed useful thing he would do . But he liked to sing and to dance , and that is what he did all day long , and far into the night as well . The longer this went on , the worse off his mother was . The youth was growing , and he wanted so much to eat that it was barely possible to find it . More and more went for his clothes the older he grew , since his clothes did not last long , as you may imagine , because the youth skipped and dance about without stopping , through forest and field .
