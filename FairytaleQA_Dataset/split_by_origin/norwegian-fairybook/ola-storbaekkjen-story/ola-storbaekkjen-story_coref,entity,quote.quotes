3	139	None	None	None	None	1,"Once upon a time there lived a man in the forest of Dovre whose name was Ola Storbaekkjen . He was of giant build , powerful and fearless . During the winter he did not work , but traveled from one fair to another , hunting up quarrels and brawls . From Christiansmarkt he went to Branaes and Konigsberg , and thence to Grundsaet , and wherever he came squabbles and brawls broke out , and in every brawl he was the victor . In the summer he dealt in cattle at Valders and the fjords , and fought with the fjord - folk and the hill people of Halling and Valders , and always had the best of it . But sometimes they scratched him a bit with the knife , did those folk . "

And he was taken into the hill , which happened in the following way : A man with a pair of gilded goat 's horns came along and butted Ola , but Ola fell upon him so that the man had to duck back , again and again . But the stranger stood up once more , and began to butt again . Finally he took Ola under his arm like a glove , and then both of them flew straight off into the hill . "

They offered him a drink , which he drank ; but he would not eat , for the food did not seem to him to be appetizing . Suddenly the man with the gilded goat 's horns came in , and gave Ola a shove before he knew it ; but Ola came back at him as before , and so they beat and pulled each other through all the rooms , and along all the walls . Ola was of the opinion that they had been at it all night long ; but by that time the scuffle had lasted over fourteen days , and they had already tolled the church bells for him on three successive Thursday evenings . On the third Thursday evening he was in ill ease , for the people in the hill had in mind to thrust him forth . When the bells stopped ringing , he sat at a crack in the hill , with his head looking out . Had not a man come by and happened to spy him , and told the people to keep on ringing the church - bells , the hill would have closed over him again , and he would probably still be inside . But when he came out he had been so badly beaten , and was so miserable , that it passed all measure . The lumps on his head were each bigger than the other , his whole body was black and blue , and he was quite out of his mind . And from time to time he would leap up , run off and try to get back into the hill to take up his quarrel again , and fight for the gilded goat 's horns . For those he wanted to break from the giant 's forehead . "
