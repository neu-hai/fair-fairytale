3	208	344	345	the pastor	314	1,"Once upon a time there was a peasant boy , who dreamed that he would get a princess , from far , far away , that she was as white as milk , and as red as blood , and so rich that her riches had no end . When he woke , it seemed to him as though she were still standing before him . She was so beautiful and winning that he could not go on living without her . So he sold all that he had , and went forth to look for her . He wandered far , and at last , in the winter - time , came into a land where the roads all ran in straight lines , and made no turns . After he had wandered straight ahead for full three months , he came to a city . And there a great block of ice lay before the church door , and in the middle of it was a corpse , and the whole congregation spat at it as the people passed by . This surprised the youth , and when the pastor came out of the church , he asked him what it meant . "
