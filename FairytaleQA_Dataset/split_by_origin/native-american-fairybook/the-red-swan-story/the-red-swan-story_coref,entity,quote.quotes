3	142	2	4	text 1,"Three brothers	394	1,"Three brothers were left destitute , by the death of their parents , at an early age . The eldest was not yet able to provide fully for their support , but he did all that he could in hunting . With this aid , and the stock of provisions already laid by in the lodge , they managed to keep along . They had no neighbors to lend them a helping hand , for the father had withdrawn many years before from the body of the tribe , and had lived ever since in a solitary place . The lads had no idea that there was a human being near them . They did not even know who their parents had been . At the time of their death , the eldest was too young to remember it .
