1,"During the first half of the eighteenth century, several large estates
in Schonen were the property of the family of Barnekow. Or rather, they were property of
its most distinguished representative at that time, Margaret Barnekow. She was the daughter of the famous captain and governor-general Count Rutger of Aschenberg, and the wife of Colonel Kjell Kristofer Barnekow. A widow at twenty-nine, she herself took over the management of her large
properties. She showed evidence of invincible courage, an
endless capacity for work, and a tireless concern for all her
many dependents and servitors."
2,"While traveling about her estates, Madame Margaret one evening came to the tavern in Fjelkinge. She was quartered for the night in a room
that had the name of being haunted. Some years before a traveler had
lain in the same room and presumably had been murdered. At any rate,
the man himself and all his belongings had disappeared without leaving
a trace. The mystery had never been explained. Since that time the
room had been haunted. Those who knew about it preferred to
travel a post-station further in the dark, rather than pass the night
in the room in question. But Margaret Barnekow did not do so. She had
already shown greater courage in greater contingencies, and chose this
particular room to sleep in without any fear."
3,"She let the lamp burn and fell asleep, after she had said her evening
prayer. On the stroke of twelve she awoke, just as some planks were
raised in the floor. Up rose a bleeding phantom whose head, split
wide open, hung down on his shoulder."
4,"""Noble lady,"" whispered the specter, ""prepare a grave in consecrated
earth for a murdered man. Deliver his murderer to the judgment
which is his due!"""
5,"God-fearing and unafraid, Madame Margaret beckoned the phantom nearer. He told her he had already addressed the same prayer to various other people. But none had had the courage to grant it. Then
Madame Margaret drew a gold ring from her finger, laid it on the
gaping wound, and tied up the head of the murdered man with her
kerchief. With a glance of unspeakable gratitude he told her the
murderer's name, and disappeared beneath the floor without a sound."
6,"The following morning Madame Margaret sent for the sheriff of the
district to come to the tavern with some of his people. She informed him
of what had happened to her during the night, and ordered those
present to tear up the floor. And there they found, buried in the
earth, the remains of a body and, in a wound in its head, the
Countess's ring. Tied about its head was her kerchief. One of the
bystanders grew pale at the sight, and fell senseless to the ground.
When he came to his senses, he confessed that he had murdered the
traveler and robbed him of his belongings. He was condemned to death
for his crime, and the body of the murdered man was buried in the
village church-yard."
7,"The ring, of peculiar shape, and its setting bearing a large gray
stone, is still preserved in the Barnekow family. Magic virtues in
cases of sickness, fire and other misfortunes are ascribed to it. And
when one of the Barnekows dies, it is said that a red spot, like a
drop of blood, appears on the stone."
