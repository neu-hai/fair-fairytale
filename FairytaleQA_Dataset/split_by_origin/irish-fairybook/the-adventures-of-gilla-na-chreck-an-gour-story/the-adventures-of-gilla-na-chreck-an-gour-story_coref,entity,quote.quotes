3	117	211	211	he	18	1,"Long ago a poor widow woman lived down by the iron forge near Enniscorthy , and she was so poor , she had no clothes to put on her son . So , she used to fix him in the ash - hole , near the fire , and pile the warm ashes about him . Accordingly , as he grew up , she sunk the pit deeper . At last , by hook or by crook , she got a goat - skin , and fastened it round his waist , and he felt quite grand , and took a walk down the street . So says she to him next morning , "
