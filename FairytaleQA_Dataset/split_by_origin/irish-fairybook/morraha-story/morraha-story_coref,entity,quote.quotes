3	302	339	341	the young man	315	1,"Morraha rose in the morning , and washed his hands and face , and said his prayers , and ate his food . He asked God to prosper the day for him ; and he went down to the brink of the sea , and he saw a currach , short and green , coming towards him . In it there was but one youthful champion , and he playing hurly from prow to stern of the currach . He had a hurl of gold and a ball of silver . He stopped not until the currach was in on the shore . He drew her up on the green grass , and put fastening on her for a day and a year , whether he should be there all that time , or should only be on land for an hour by the clock . And Morraha saluted the young man in words intelligent , intelligible , such as were spoken at that time . The other saluted him in the same fashion , and asked him would he play a game of cards with him ; and Morraha said he had not the wherewithal . The other answered that he was never without a candle or the making of it . He put his hand in his pocket and drew out a table and two chairs and a pack of cards , and they sat down on the chairs and went to the card - playing . The first game Morraha won , and the slender red champion bade him make his claim . He said that the land above him should be filled with stock of sheep in the morning . It was well , and he played no second game , but home he went .
