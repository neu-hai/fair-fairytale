And the cock and the hen got into it , and were driven off . Very soon they met a cat , who asked where they were going . The cock answered ,

But when they came to Mr. Korbes 's house he was not at home . So the mice drew the carriage into the barn , the cock and the hen flew up and perched on a beam , the cat sat by the fireside , the duck settled on the water ; but the egg wrapped itself in the towel , the pin stuck itself in the chair cushion , the needle jumped into the bed among the pillows , and the millstone laid itself by the door .

Then he ran quickly into the kitchen to wash himself , but the duck splashed water in his face . Then he was going to wipe it with the towel , but the egg broke in it , and stuck his eyelids together . In order to get a little peace he sat down in his chair , but the pin ran into him , and , starting up , in his vexation he threw himself on the bed , but as his head fell on the pillow , in went the needle , so that he called out with the pain , and madly rushed out . But when he reached the housedoor the mill - stone jumped up and struck him dead . What a bad man Mr. Korbes must have been ! "
