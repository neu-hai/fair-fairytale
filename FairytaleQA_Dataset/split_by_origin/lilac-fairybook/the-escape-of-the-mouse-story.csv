1,"Manawyddan the prince and his friend Pryderi were wanderers. The
brother of Manawyddan had been slain. His throne was taken from him.
Very sorrowful was Manawyddan, but Pryderi was stout of heart, and bade
him be of good cheer. He knew a way out of his trouble.

'And what may that be?' asked Manawyddan.

'It is that thou marry my mother Rhiannon and become lord of the fair
lands that I will give her for dowry. Never did any lady have more wit
than she. In her youth none was more lovely; even yet she is good to
look upon.'

'Thou art the best friend that ever a man had,' said Manawyddan. 'Let us
go now to seek Rhiannon, and the lands where she dwells.'"
2,"Then they set forth, but the news of their coming ran swifter still. Rhiannon and Kieva, wife of Pryderi, made haste to prepare a feast for
them. And Manawyddan found that Pryderi had spoken the truth concerning
his mother, and asked if she would take him for her husband. Right
gladly did she consent, and without delay they were married, and rode
away to the hunt, Rhiannon and Manawyddan, Kieva and Pryderi. They
would not be parted from each other by night or by day, so great was the
love between them.

One day, when they were returned, they were sitting out in a green
place. Suddenly the crash of thunder struck loudly on their ears. A wall of mist fell between them, so that they were hidden one from
the other. Trembling they sat till the darkness fled and the light shone
again upon them. In the place where they were wont to see cattle,
and herds, and dwellings, they beheld neither house nor beast, nor man
nor smoke. Neither was any one remaining in the green place save these
four only."
3,"'Whither have they gone, and my host also?' cried Manawyddan. They
searched the hall, and there was no man, and the castle, and there was
none. In the dwellings that were left was nothing save wild beasts.
For a year these four fed on the meat that Manawyddan and Pryderi killed
out hunting, and the honey of the bees that sucked the mountain heather.
For a time they desired nothing more, but when the next year began they
grew weary.

'We cannot spend our lives thus,' said Manawyddan at last, 'let us go
into England and learn some trade by which we may live.' So they
left Wales, and went to Hereford. There they made saddles, while
Manawyddan fashioned blue enamel ornaments to put on their trappings.
And so greatly did the townsfolk love these saddles. No others
were bought throughout the whole of Hereford, till the saddlers banded
together and resolved to slay Manawyddan and his companions."
4,"When Pryderi heard of it, he was very wroth, and wished to stay and
fight. But the counsels of Manawyddan prevailed. They moved by night
to another city.

'What craft shall we follow?' asked Pryderi.

'We will make shields,' answered Manawyddan.

'But do we know anything of that craft?' answered Pryderi."
5,"'We will try it,' said Manawyddan. They began to make shields, and
fashioned them after the shape of the shields they had seen. These
likewise they enamelled. And so greatly did they prosper that no man
in the town bought a shield except they had made it. The
shield-makers banded together as the saddlers had done, and resolved to
slay them. But of this they had warning, and by night betook themselves
to another town.

'Let us take to making shoes,' said Manawyddan, 'for there are not any
among the shoemakers bold enough to fight us.'

'I know nothing of making shoes,' answered Pryderi, who in truth
despised so peaceful a craft.

'But I know,' replied Manawyddan, 'and I will teach thee to stitch. We
will buy the leather ready dressed, and will make the shoes from it.'"
6,"Then straightway he sought the town for the best leather, and for a
goldsmith to fashion the clasps. He himself watched till it was
done, so that he might learn for himself. Soon he became known as 'The
Maker of Gold Shoes,' and prospered so greatly, that as long as one
could be bought from him not a shoe was purchased from the shoemakers
of the town. And the craftsmen were wroth, and banded together to slay
them.

'Pryderi,' said Manawyddan, when he had received news of it, 'we will
not remain in England any longer. Let us set forth to Dyved.'

So they journeyed until they came to their lands at Narberth. There they
gathered their dogs round them, and hunted for a year as before."
7,"After that a strange thing happened. One morning Pryderi and Manawyddan
rose up to hunt, and loosened their dogs, which ran before them. They came to a small bush. At the bush, the dogs shrank away as if
frightened. They returned to their masters, their hair brisling on their
backs.

'We must see what is in that bush,' said Pryderi, and what was in it was
a boar, with a skin as white as the snow on the mountains. And he came
out, and made a stand as the dogs rushed on him, driven on by the men.
Long he stood at bay. Then at last he betook himself to flight, and fled
to a castle which was newly built, in a place where no building had ever
been known. Into the castle he ran, and the dogs after him, and long
though their masters looked and listened. They neither saw nor heard
aught concerning dogs or boar."
8,"'I will go into the castle and get tidings of the dogs,' said Pryderi at
last.

'Truly,' answered Manawyddan, 'thou wouldst do unwisely, for whosoever
has cast a spell over this land has set this castle here.'

'I cannot give up my dogs,' replied Pryderi, and to the castle he went."
9,"But within was neither man nor beast; neither boar nor dogs, but only
a fountain with marble round it, and on the edge a golden bowl, richly
wrought, which pleased Pryderi greatly. In a moment he forgot about his
dogs, and went up to the bowl and took hold of it. His hands
stuck to the bowl, and his feet to the marble slab, and despair took
possession of him.

Till the close of day Manawyddan waited for him. When the sun was
fast sinking, he went home, thinking that he had strayed far.

'Where are thy friend and thy dogs?' said Rhiannon, and he told her what
had befallen Pryderi.

'A good friend hast thou lost,' answered Rhiannon, and she went up to
the castle and through the gate, which was open. There, in the centre of
the courtyard, she beheld Pryderi standing, and hastened towards him."
10,"'What dost thou here?' she asked, laying her hand on the bowl. As
she spoke she too stuck fast, and was not able to utter a word. Then
thunder was heard and a veil of darkness descended upon them. The
castle vanished and they with it.

When Kieva, the wife of Pryderi, found that neither her husband nor
his mother returned to her, she was in such sorrow that she cared not
whether she lived or died. Manawyddan was grieved also in his heart, and
said to her:

'It is not fitting that we should stay here. He have lost our dogs
and cannot get food. Let us go into England--it is easier for us to live
there.' So they set forth."
11,"'What craft wilt thou follow?' asked Kieva as they went along.

'I shall make shoes as once I did,' replied he. He got all the
finest leather in the town and caused gilded clasps to be made for the
shoes, till everyone flocked to buy. All the shoemakers in the
town were idle and banded together in anger to kill him. But luckily
Manawyddan got word of it. He and Kieva left the town one night and
proceeded to Narberth. He took with him a sheaf of wheat, which he sowed
in three plots of ground. And while the wheat was growing up, he hunted
and fished. They had food enough and to spare. Thus the months
passed until the harvest. One evening Manawyddan visited the
furthest of his fields of wheat; and saw that it was ripe."
12,"'To-morrow I will reap this,' said he. On the morrow when he went to
reap the wheat he found nothing but the bare straw.

Filled with dismay he hastened to the second field. There the corn
was ripe and golden.

'To-morrow I will reap this,' he said. On the morrow the ears had
gone, and there was nothing but the bare straw.

'Well, there is still one field left,' he said, and when he looked
at it, it was still fairer than the other two. 'To-night I will watch
here,' thought he. 'Whosoever carried off the other corn will in
like manner take this. I will know who it is.' So he hid himself and
waited."
13,"The hours slid by, and all was still, so still that Manawyddan well-nigh
dropped asleep. But at midnight there arose the loudest tumult in the
world, and peeping out he beheld a mighty host of mice, which could
neither be numbered nor measured. Each mouse climbed up a straw till
it bent down with its weight. Then it bit off one of the ears, and
carried it away. There was not one of the straws that had not got a
mouse to it.

Full of wrath he rushed at the mice. He could no more come up with
them than if they had been gnats, or birds of the air, save one only
which lingered behind the rest, and this mouse Manawyddan came up with.
Stooping down he seized it by the tail, and put it in his glove, and
tied a piece of string across the opening of the glove, so that the
mouse could not escape. When he entered the hall where Kieva was
sitting, he lighted a fire, and hung the glove up on a peg."
14,"'What hast thou there?' asked she.

'A thief,' he answered, 'that I caught robbing me.'

'What kind of a thief may it be which thou couldst put in thy glove?'
said Kieva.

'That I will tell thee,' he replied. Then he showed her how his
fields of corn had been wasted, and how he had watched for the mice.

'And one was less nimble than the rest, and is now in my glove.
To-morrow I will hang it, and I only wish I had them all.'"
15,"'It is a marvel, truly,' said she, 'yet it would be unseemly for a man
of thy dignity to hang a reptile such as this. Do not meddle with it,
but let it go.'

'Woe betide me,' he cried, 'if I would not hang them all if I could
catch them, and such as I have I will hang.'

'Verily,' said she, 'there is no reason I should succour this reptile,
except to prevent discredit unto thee.'

'If I knew any cause that I should succour it, I would take thy
counsel,' answered Manawyddan, 'but I know of none. I am minded to
destroy it.'

'Do so then,' said Kieva."
16,"So he went up a hill and set up two forks on the top. While he
was doing this he saw a scholar coming towards him, whose clothes were
tattered. Now it was seven years since Manawyddan had seen man or beast
in that place, and the sight amazed him.

'Good day to thee, my lord,' said the scholar.

'Good greeting to thee, scholar. Whence dost thou come?'

'From singing in England; but wherefore dost thou ask?'

'Because for seven years no man hath visited this place.'

'I wander where I will,' answered the scholar. 'And what work art thou
upon?'"
17,"'I am about to hang a thief that I caught robbing me!'

'What manner of thief is that?' inquired the scholar. 'I see a creature
in thy hand like upon a mouse, and ill does it become a man of thy rank
to touch a reptile like this. Let it go free.'

'I will not let it go free,' cried Manawyddan. 'I caught it robbing me,
and it shall suffer the doom of a thief.'

'Lord!' said the scholar, 'sooner than see a man like thee at such a
work. I would give thee a pound which I have received as alms to let it
go free.'

'I will not let it go free, neither will I sell it.'

'As thou wilt, lord,' answered the scholar, and he went his way."
18,"Manawyddan was placing the cross-beam on the two forked sticks, where
the mouse was to hang, when a priest rode past.

'Good-day to thee, lord; and what art thou doing?'

'I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me.'

'What manner of thief, lord?'

'A creature in the form of a mouse. It has been robbing me. It shall
suffer the doom of a thief.'

'Lord,' said the priest, 'sooner than see thee touch this reptile, I
would purchase its freedom.'"
19,"'I will neither sell it nor set it free.'

'It is true that a mouse is worth nothing. Rather than see thee
defile thyself with touching such a reptile as this, I will give thee
three pounds for it.'

'I will not take any price for it. It shall be hanged as it deserves.'

'Willingly, my lord, if it is thy pleasure.' And the priest went his
way."
20,"Then Manawyddan noosed the string about the mouse's neck, and was
about to draw it tight. A bishop, with a great following and horses
bearing huge packs, came by.

'What work art thou upon?' asked the bishop, drawing rein.

'Hanging a thief that I caught robbing me.'

'But is not that a mouse that I see in thine hand?' asked the bishop.

'Yes; that is the thief,' answered Manawyddan."
21,"'Well, since I have come at the doom of this reptile, I will ransom it
of thee for seven pounds, rather than see a man of thy rank touch it.
Loose it, and let it go.'

'I will not let it loose.'

'I will give thee four and twenty pounds to set it free,' said the
bishop.

'I will not set it free for as much again.'

'If thou wilt not set it free for this, I will give thee all the horses
thou seest and the seven loads of baggage.'"
22,"'I will not set it free.'

'Then tell me at what price thou wilt loose it. I will give it.'

'The spell must be taken off Rhiannon and Pryderi,' said Manawyddan.

'That shall be done.'

'But not yet will I loose the mouse. The charm that has been cast over
all my lands must be taken off likewise.'"
23,"'This shall be done also.'

'But not yet will I loose the mouse till I know who she is.'

'She is my wife,' answered the bishop.

'And wherefore came she to me?' asked Manawyddan."
24,"'To despoil thee,' replied the bishop. 'It is I who cast the charm
over thy lands, to avenge Gwawl the son of Clud my friend. And it was I
who threw the spell upon Pryderi to avenge Gwawl for the trick that had
been played on him in the game of Badger in the Bag. And not only was I
wroth, but my people likewise. When it was known that thou wast come
to dwell in the land, they besought me much to change them into mice,
that they might eat thy corn. The first and the second nights it was
the men of my own house that destroyed thy two fields. On the third
night my wife and her ladies came to me. They begged me to change them
also into the shape of mice, that they might take part in avenging
Gwawl. Therefore I changed them. Yet had she not been ill and slow of
foot, thou couldst not have overtaken her. Still, since she was caught,
I will restore thee Pryderi and Rhiannon. I will take the charm from
off thy lands. I have told thee who she is; so now set her free.'"
25,"'I will not set her free,' answered Manawyddan, 'till thou swear that no
vengeance shall be taken for his, either upon Pryderi, or upon Rhiannon,
or on me.'

'I will grant thee this boon. Thou hast done wisely to ask it. On thy head would have lit all the trouble. Set now my wife free.'

'I will not set her free till Pryderi and Rhiannon are with me.'

'Behold, here they come,' said the bishop."
26,"Then Manawyddan held out his hands and greeted Pryderi and Rhiannon, and
they seated themselves joyfully on the grass.

'Ah, lord, hast thou not received all thou didst ask?' said the bishop.
'Set now my wife free!'

'That I will gladly,' answered Manawyddan. Unloosing the cord from her
neck, and as he did so the bishop struck her with his staff. She
turned into a young woman, the fairest that ever was seen."
27,"'Look around upon thy land,' said he. 'Thou wilt see it all tilled
and peopled, as it was long ago.' And Manawyddan looked, and saw corn
growing in the fields, and cows and sheep grazing on the hill-side, and
huts for the people to dwell in. And he was satisfied in his soul, but
one more question he put to the bishop.

'What spell didst thou lay upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?'

'Pryderi has had the knockers of the gate of my palace hung about him. Rhiannon has carried the collars of my asses around her neck,' said
the bishop with a smile."
