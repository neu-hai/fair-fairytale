1,"In a country, far across the sea, there once dwelt a great and mightyPrince. He lived in a grand Castle, which was full of beautifulfurniture, and curious and rare ornaments. And among them was a lovelylittle glass shoe, which would only fit the tiniest foot imaginable.And as the Prince was looking at it one day, it struck him what a daintylittle lady she would need to be who wore such a very small shoe. And,as he liked dainty people, he made up his mind that he would never marryuntil he found a maiden who could wear the shoe, and that, when he foundher, he would ask her to be his wife.And he called all his Lords and Courtiers to him, and told them of thedetermination that he had come to, and asked them to help him in hisquest."
2,"And after they had taken counsel together they summoned a trusty Knight,and appointed him the Prince's Ambassador; and told him to take theslipper, and mount a fleet-footed horse, and ride up and down the wholeof the Kingdom until he found a lady whom it would fit.So the Ambassador put the little shoe carefully in his pocket and setout on his errand.He rode, and he rode, and he rode, going to every town and castle thatcame in his way, and summoning all the ladies to appear before him totry on the shoe. And, as he caused a Proclamation to be made thatwhoever could wear it should be the Prince's Bride, I need not tell youthat all the ladies in the country-side flocked to wherever theAmbassador chanced to be staying, and begged leave to try on theslipper."
3,"But they were all disappointed, for not one of them, try as she would,could make her foot small enough to go into the Fairy Shoe; and therewere many bitter tears shed in secret, when they returned home, bycountless fair ladies who prided themselves on the smallness of theirfeet, and who had set out full of lively expectation that they would bethe successful competitors.At last the Ambassador arrived at a house where a well-to-do Laird hadlived. But the Laird was dead now, and there was nobody left but hiswife and two daughters, who had grown poor of late, and who had to workhard for their living.One of the daughters was haughty and insolent; the other was little, andyoung, and modest, and sweet."
4,"When the Ambassador rode into the courtyard of this house, and, holdingout the shoe, asked if there were any fair ladies there who would liketo try it on, the elder sister, who always thought a great deal ofherself, ran forward, and said that she would do so, while the youngergirl just shook her head and went on with her work. ""For,"" said she toherself, ""though my feet are so little that they might go into theslipper, what would I do as the wife of a great Prince? Folk would justlaugh at me, and say that I was not fit for the position. No, no, I amfar better to bide as I am.""So the Ambassador gave the glass shoe to the elder sister, who carriedit away to her own room; and presently, to every one's astonishment,came back wearing it on her foot.It is true that her face was very white, and that she walked with alittle limp; but no one noticed these things except her younger sister,and she only shook her wise little head, and said nothing."
5,"The Prince's Ambassador was delighted that he had at last found a wifefor his master, and he mounted his horse and rode off at full speed totell him the good news.When the Prince heard of the success of his errand, he ordered all hisCourtiers to be ready to accompany him next day when he went to bringhome his Bride.You can fancy what excitement there was at the Laird's house when thegallant company arrived, with their Prince at their head, to greet thelady who was to be their Princess.The old mother and the plain-looking maid-of-all-work ran hither andthither, fetching such meat and drink as the house could boast to setbefore their high-born visitors, while the bonnie little sister went andhid herself behind a great pot which stood in the corner of thecourtyard, and which was used for boiling hen's meat."
6,"She knew that her foot was the smallest in the house; and something toldher that if the Prince once got a glimpse of her he would not be contenttill she had tried on the slipper.Meanwhile, the selfish elder sister did not help at all, but ran up toher chamber, and decked herself out in all the fine clothes that shepossessed before she came downstairs to meet the Prince.And when all the Knights and Courtiers had drunk a stirrup-cup, andwished Good Luck to their Lord and his Bride, she was lifted up behindthe Prince on his horse, and rode off so full of her own importance,that she even forgot to say good-bye to her mother and sister."
7,"Alas! alas! pride must have a fall. For the cavalcade had not proceededvery far when a little bird which was perched on a branch of a bush bythe roadside sang out:    ""Nippit fit, and clippit fit, behind the King rides,    But pretty fit, and little fit, ahint the caldron hides.""""What is this that the birdie says?"" cried the Prince, who, if the truthbe told, did not feel altogether satisfied with the Bride whom fortunehad bestowed upon him. ""Do you have another sister, Madam?""""Only a little one,"" murmured the lady, who liked ill the way in whichthings seemed to be falling out.""We will go back and find her,"" said the Prince firmly, ""for when I sentout the slipper I had no mind that its wearer should nip her foot, andclip her foot, in order to get it on."""
8,"So the whole party turned back; and when they reached the Laird's housethe Prince ordered a search to be made in the courtyard. And the bonnielittle sister was soon discovered and brought out, all blushes andconfusion, from her hiding-place behind the caldron.""Give her the slipper, and let her try it on,"" said the Prince, and theeldest sister was forced to obey. And what was the horror of thebystanders, as she drew it off, to see that she had cut off the tops ofher toes in order to get it on.But it fitted her little sister's foot exactly, without either paring orclipping; and when the Prince saw that it was so, he lifted the eldersister down from his horse and lifted the little one up in her place,and carried her home to his Palace, where the wedding was celebratedwith great rejoicing; and for the rest of their lives they were thehappiest couple in the whole kingdom."
