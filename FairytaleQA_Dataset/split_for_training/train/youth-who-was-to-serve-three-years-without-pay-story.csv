1,"Once upon a time there was a poor man, who had only one son; but one who
was so lazy and clumsy that he did not want to do a stroke of work. ""If
I am not to feed this bean-pole for the rest of my life, I'll have to
send him far away, where not a soul knows him,"" thought the father.
""Once he is knocking about in the world, he will not be so likely to
come home again."" So he took his son and led him about in the world, far
and wide, and tried to get him taken on as a serving man; but no one
would have him. Finally, after wandering a long time, they came to a
rich man, of whom it was said that he turned every shilling around seven
times before he could make up his mind to part with it. He was willing
to take the youth for a servant, and he was to work three years without
pay. But at the end of the three years, his master was to go into town,
two days in succession, and buy the first thing he saw, and on the third
morning the youth himself was to go to town and also buy the first thing
he met. And all this he was to receive in lieu of his wage."
2,"So the youth served out his three years, and did better than they had
expected him to do. He was by no means a model serving-man; but then
his master was none of the best, either, for he let him go all that time
in the same clothes he had worn when he entered his service, until,
finally, one patch elbowed the other.

Now when his master was to go to do his buying, he set out as early as
possible in the morning. ""Costly wares are only to be seen by day,"" said
he, ""they are not drifting about the street so early. It will probably
cost me enough as it is, for what I find is a matter of purest chance.""
The first thing he saw on the street was an old woman, who was carrying
a covered basket. ""Good-day, granny,"" said the man. ""And good-day to
you, daddy,"" said the old woman."
3,"""What have you in your basket?"" asked the man. ""Would you like to know?""
said the woman. ""Yes,"" said the man, ""for I have to buy the first thing
that comes my way."" ""Well, if you want to know, buy it!"" said the old
woman. ""What does it cost?"" asked the man. She must have four shillings
for it, declared the woman. This did not seem such a tremendous price to
him, he would let it go at that, said he, and raised the cover. And
there lay a pup in the basket. When the man got home from his journey to
town, there stood the youth full of impatience and curiosity, wondering
what his wage for the first year might be. ""Are you back already,
master?"" asked the youth. ""Yes, indeed,"" said his master. ""And what have
you bought?"" asked the youth. ""What I have bought is nothing so very
rare,"" said the man. ""I don't even know whether I ought to show it to
you; but I bought the first thing to be had, and that was a pup,"" said
he. ""And I thank you most kindly for it,"" said the youth. ""I have always
been fond of dogs."""
4,"The following morning it was no better. The man set out as early as
possible, and had not as yet reached town before he met the old woman
with the basket. ""Good-day, granny,"" said the man. ""And good-day to you,
daddy,"" said the old woman. ""What have you in your basket to-day?"" asked
the man. ""If you want to know, then buy it!"" was again the answer. ""What
does it cost?"" asked the man. She wanted four shillings for it, she had
only the one price. The man said he would buy it, for he thought that
this time he would make a better purchase. He raised the cover, and this
time a kitten lay in the basket. When he reached home, there stood the
youth, waiting to see what he was to get in lieu of his second year's
wages. ""Are you back again, master!"" said he. ""Yes, indeed,"" said the
master. ""What did you buy to-day?"" asked the youth. ""Alas, nothing
better than I did yesterday,"" said the man, ""but I did as we agreed, and
bought the first thing I came across, and that was this kitten."" ""You
could not have hit on anything better,"" said the youth, ""for all my life
long I have been fond of cats as well as of dogs."" ""I do not fare so
badly this way,"" thought the man, ""but when he sets out for himself,
then the matter will probably turn out differently."""
5,"So the third morning the youth set out for himself, and when he entered
town, he came across the same old woman with her basket on her arm.
""Good morning, granny,"" said he. ""And good morning to you, my boy,"" said
the old woman. ""What have you in your basket?"" asked the youth. ""If you
want to know, then buy it!"" answered the old woman. ""Do you want to sell
it?"" asked the youth. Yes, indeed, and it would cost four shillings,
said the old woman. That is a bargain, thought the youth, and wanted to
take it, for he had to buy the first thing that came his way. ""Well, you
can take the whole blessed lot,"" said the old woman, ""the basket and all
that's in it. But do not look into it before you get home, do you hear!"""
6,"No, indeed, he would be sure not to look in the basket, said he. But on
the way, he kept wondering as to what might be in the basket, and
willy-nilly--he could not keep from raising the cover a little, and
looking through the crack. But that very minute a little lizard popped
out of the crack, and ran across the road so quickly that it fairly
hummed--and aside from the lizard there was nothing in the basket.
""Stop, wait a minute, and don't run away! I just bought you,"" said the
youth. ""Stab me in the neck! Stab me in the neck!"" cried the lizard. The
youth did not have to be told twice. He ran after the lizard and stabbed
it in the neck just as it was slipping into a hole in a wall. And that
very moment it turned into a man, as handsome and splendid as the
handsomest prince, and a prince he was, if truth be told."
7,"""Now you have delivered me,"" said he, ""for the old woman, with whom you
and your master have been dealing, is a witch, and she turned me into a
lizard, and my brother and sister into a dog and cat."" The youth thought
this a remarkable tale. ""Yes, indeed,"" said the prince. ""She was
actually on the way to throw us into the sea and drown us; but if any
one were to appear and want to buy us, she had to sell us for four
shillings apiece, that had been agreed upon. And now you shall go home
with me to my father, and be rewarded for your good deed."" ""Your home
must be a good way off,"" said the youth. ""O, it is not so far,"" declared
the prince, ""there it is!"" And he pointed to a high hill in the
distance."
8,"They marched along as fast as they could, but still it was farther away
than it seemed. So it was late at night before they reached their goal.
The prince knocked. ""Who is knocking at my door, and disturbing my
sleep?"" came a voice within the hill. And the voice was so powerful that
the earth trembled. ""Open, father, your son has come home!"" cried the
prince. Then the father was glad to open the door quickly. ""I thought
you were already lying at the bottom of the sea,"" said the old man.
""But you are not alone?"" ""This is the chap who delivered me,"" said the
prince, ""and I asked him to come with me so that you could reward him.""
That he would attend to, said the old man. ""Now you must come right in,""
said he, ""for here you may rest in safety."" They went in and sat down,
and the old man laid an armful of wood and a couple of big logs on the
fire, until every corner was as bright as day, and wherever they looked
everything was indescribably splendid. The youth had never seen anything
like it, and such fine things to eat and drink as the old man served up
to him, he had never yet tasted. And the bowls and dishes, and goblets
and plates, were all of pure silver and shining gold."
9,"There was no need to urge the young folk. They ate and drank and enjoyed
themselves, and then slept far into the next day. The youth was still
asleep when the old man came and offered him a morning draft in a golden
goblet. And when he had put on his rags and breakfasted, he was allowed
to pick out what he wanted, as a reward for delivering the prince. There
was much to see and still more to take, as you may believe. ""Well, what
do you want?"" asked the king. ""You may take what you will; for as you
see there is enough from which to choose."" The youth said he would have
to think it over a bit, and speak to the prince. And that he was allowed
to do."
10,"""Well, I suppose you have seen all sorts of beautiful things?""
asked the prince. ""That is a fact,"" said the youth. ""But tell me, what
ought I to choose among all these magnificent things? Your father said I
might pick out whatever I wished."" ""You must choose none among all the
things you have seen,"" answered the prince, ""but my father wears a ring
on his little finger, and you must ask him for that."" This the youth
did, and begged the king for the ring on his finger. ""It is dearer to
me than anything else I have,"" said the king, ""but my son is just as
dear to me, and therefore I will give you the ring. Do you know what
powers it has?"" No, that the youth did not know. ""While you wear it on
your finger, you can get everything that you want to have,"" said the
king. The youth thanked him most kindly, and the king and the prince
wished him all manner of luck on his journey, and charged him to take
the best care of the ring."
11,"He had not been long underway before it occurred to him to test what the
ring could do. So he wished to be dressed in new clothes from head to
toe, and no more had he uttered the wish than there he was in them. And
he looked as handsome and bright as a new nickel. Then he thought to
himself it would be pleasant to play a trick on his father. ""He was none
too friendly to me while I was still at home."" And so the youth wished
he were standing before his father's door, just as ragged as he had been
before. And that very minute there he stood.

""Good-day, father, and many thanks for the last time!"" said the youth.
But when his father saw he had come home far more tattered and torn than
when he had gone away, he grew angry and began to scold: ""There is
nothing to be made of you, if during all the long years of your service
you have not even been able to earn a suit of clothes to your back."""
12,"""Now do not be so angry, father,"" said the youth. ""You need not take for
granted that a fellow is a vagabond because he goes about in rags. Now
I want you to go to the king as my proxy, and ask his daughter's hand
for me."" ""Come, come, why, that is utter folly and nonsense!"" cried his
father. But the youth insisted that it was gospel truth, and took a
birch bough, and drove his father to the king's castle-gate. And the
latter came stumbling right in to the king, and wept so that the tears
just tumbled out.

""Well, what has happened to you, my dear fellow?"" asked the king. ""If a
wrong has been done you, I will see that you get your rights."" No, no
wrong had been done him, said the man, but he had a son who gave him a
great deal of trouble: it was impossible to make a man of him, and now
he had evidently lost what few senses he did possess. ""Because he has
just chased me to the castle-gate with a birch bough, and threatened me,
if I do not get him the king's daughter for a bride,"" said the man. ""Set
your mind at rest, my good fellow,"" said the king, ""and send your son to
me. Then we will see whether we can come to an understanding."""
13,"The youth came rushing in to the king, so that his rags fairly
fluttered. ""Do I get your daughter?"" he cried. ""Well, that is just what
we are going to discuss,"" said the king, ""perhaps she would not answer
for you, and perhaps you would not answer for her,"" said he. That might
be the case, said the youth.

Now a great ship from abroad had shortly before come into port, and one
could see it from the castle window. ""Now we'll see,"" said the king. ""If
you can build a ship that is the exact counterpart of the one outside,
and just as handsome, in the space of an hour or two, then, perhaps, you
may get my daughter,"" said the king."
14,"""If it be no more than that ..."" said the youth. Then he went down to
the shore and sat on a sand-pile, and when he had sat there long enough,
he wished that a ship might lie out in the fjord, completely equipped
with masts and sails and all that goes with them, and that it might
resemble the ship already lying there in every particular. And that very
minute there lay the ship, and when the king saw that there were two
ships at anchor instead of one, he came down to the shore himself to
look more closely into the matter. And then he saw the youth. He was
standing in a boat, with a broom in one hand, as though he meant to give
the ship a final cleaning; but when he saw the king coming, he threw
away the broom and cried: ""Now the ship is finished. Do I get your
daughter now?""

""That is all very fine,"" said the king, ""but you must stand yet another
test. If you can build a castle that is just like mine in every
particular within an hour or so, then we will go further into the
matter."""
15,"""No more than that?"" cried the youth. After he had strolled around for a
long while, and the time set was nearly over, he wished that a castle
might stand there that resembled the king's castle in every particular.
And before long there it stood, as you may believe. And it did not
take long, either, before the king, together with the queen and the
princess, came to look at the new castle. The youth stood there with his
broom again, and swept and cleaned. ""Now the castle is in apple-pie
order. Do I get her now?"" he cried."
16,"""That's all very fine,"" declared the king, ""just come in and we'll talk
it over,"" said he, for he had noticed that the youth knew a thing or
two, and he was thinking over how he might get rid of him. The king went
on ahead, and after him the queen, and then went the princess, just in
advance of the youth. Then he at once wished to be the handsomest man in
the world, and so he was, that very minute. When the princess saw what
a splendid figure he suddenly cut, she nudged the queen, who in turn
nudged the king, and after they had stared at him long enough, they at
last realized that the youth was more than he had at first appeared to
be, in his rags. So they decided that the princess was to treat him
nicely, in order to find out how matters really stood, and the princess
was as sweet and amiable as sugar-bread, and flattered the youth, and
said that she could not do without him, night or day. And when it came
toward the end of the first evening, she said: ""Since you and I are to
be married in any case, I am sure you will have no secrets from me, and
you will not want to hide from me how you managed to do all these fine
things."""
17,"""O, yes,"" said the youth. ""You shall know about it, but first of all let
us be married; before that nothing counts!""

The following evening the princess pretended to be quite unhappy. She
was well aware, said she, that he did not attach much importance to her
love, when he would not even tell her what she wanted so much to know.
If he could not even oblige her in such a small matter, his love could
not amount to a great deal. Then the youth fell into despair, and to
make up with her again, he told her everything. She lost no time, and
let the king and queen know all about it. Thereupon they agreed as to
how they would go about getting the youth's ring away from him, and
then, thought they, it would not really be hard to get rid of him."
18,"In the evening the princess came with a sleeping potion, and said she
wanted to give her lover a drink that would increase his love for her,
since it was plain he did not love her enough. The youth suspected
nothing, and drank, and at once fell so fast asleep that they could have
pulled down the house over his head. Then the princess drew the ring
from his finger, put it on herself, and wished the youth might be lying
on the garbage-pile in the street, just as tattered and torn as he had
come to them, and in his place she wanted the handsomest prince in the
world. And that very minute everything happened just as she wished.
After a time the youth woke up, out on the garbage-pile, and at
first thought he was dreaming: but when he saw the ring was gone, he
understood how it all had happened, and fell into such despair that he
got up and wanted to jump right into the sea.

But then he met the cat his master had bought for him. ""Where are you
going?"" she asked. ""To throw myself into the sea and drown,"" was the
youth's reply."
19,"""Do not do so on any account,"" said the cat. ""You will get your ring
again.""

""Yes, if that were so, then ..."" said the youth.

The cat ran away. Suddenly a rat crossed her path. ""Now I will pounce on
you!"" said the cat. ""O do not do that,"" said the rat, ""you shall have
the ring again!""

""Well, if that is so, then ..."" said the cat.

When the folk at the castle had gone to bed, the rat crept around, and
sniffed and spied out the room of the prince and princess; and at last
he found a little hole through which he crawled. Then he heard the
prince and princess talking to each other, and saw that the prince was
wearing the ring on his finger. Before she went, the princess said:
""Good night. And see that you take good care of the ring, my dearest!""

""Pooh! no one will come in through the walls for the sake of a ring,""
said the prince, ""but if you think it is not safe enough on my hand,
why, I can put it in my mouth."""
20,"After a time he lay down on his back, and prepared to go to sleep. But
just then the ring slipped down his throat, and he had to cough, so
that the ring flew out and rolled along the ground. Swish!--the rat had
caught it, and crept out with it to the cat, who was waiting at the
rat-hole. But in the meantime the king had caught the youth, and had had
him put in a great tower and condemned to death, because he had made a
mock of his daughter--so the king said. And the youth was to sit in the
tower until he was beheaded. But the cat kept prowling around the tower
all the time, trying to sneak in with the ring. And then an eagle came
along, caught her up in his claws and flew across the sea with her. And
suddenly a hawk appeared, and flung himself on the eagle, and the eagle
let the cat fall into the sea. When she felt the water, she grew afraid,
let the ring fall, and swam to land. No sooner had she shaken the water
from her fur than she met the dog whom the youth's master had bought for
him.

""Well, what am I to do now?"" said the cat, and wept and lamented. ""The
ring is gone, and they want to murder the youth."" ""That I do not know,""
said the dog, ""but what I do know is that I have the very worst kind of
an ache in my stomach,"" said he."
21,"""There you have it. You have surely over-eaten,"" said the cat.

""I never eat more than I need,"" said the dog, ""and just now I have eaten
nothing at all, save a dead fish that was left here by the ebb-tide.""

""Could the fish have swallowed the ring?"" asked the cat. ""And must you,
also, lose your life, because you cannot digest gold?""

""That may well be the case,"" said the dog. ""But then it would be best
if I died at once, for then the youth might still be saved.""

""O, that is not necessary!"" said the rat--who was there, too--""I do not
need a very large opening through which to crawl, and if the ring is
really there, I am sure I can find it."" So the rat slipped down into the
dog, and before very long he came out again with the ring. And then the
cat made her way to the tower, and clawed her way up till she found a
hole through which she could thrust her paw, and thus brought back the
ring to the youth."
22,"No sooner was it on his finger than he wished that the tower might break
down, and that very moment he was standing just before the tower-gate,
and reviling the king and the queen and the king's daughter as though
they were the lowest of the low. The king hastily called together his
army, and told it to surround the tower, and take the youth prisoner,
dead or alive. But the youth only wished the whole army might be
sticking up to their necks in the big swamp in the hills, and there they
had trouble enough getting out--those among them who did not stick fast.
Then he went right on reviling where he had stopped, and finally, when
he had told them all just what he thought of them, he wished that the
king, the queen and the king's daughter might sit for the rest of their
lives in the tower into which they had thrust him. And when they were
sitting there, he took possession of the king's land and country on his
own account. Then the dog changed into a prince, and the cat into a
princess, and he made the latter his wife, and they were married and
celebrated their wedding long and profusely."
