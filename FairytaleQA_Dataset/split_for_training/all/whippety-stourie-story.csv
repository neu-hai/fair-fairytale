1,"I am going to tell you a story about a poor young widow woman, who livedin a house called Kittlerumpit, though whereabouts in Scotland the houseof Kittlerumpit stood nobody knows.Some folk think that it stood in the neighbourhood of the DebateableLand, which, as all the world knows, was on the Borders, where the oldBorder Reivers were constantly coming and going; the Scotch stealingfrom the English, and the English from the Scotch. Be that as it may,the widowed Mistress of Kittlerumpit was sorely to be pitied.For she had lost her husband, and no one quite knew what had become ofhim. He had gone to a fair one day, and had never come back again, andalthough everybody believed that he was dead, no one knew how he died.Some people said that he had been persuaded to enlist, and had beenkilled in the wars; others, that he had been taken away to serve as asailor by the press-gang, and had been drowned at sea."
2,"At any rate, his poor young wife was sorely to be pitied, for she wasleft with a little baby-boy to bring up, and, as times were bad, she hadnot much to live on.But she loved her baby dearly, and worked all day amongst her cows, andpigs, and hens, in order to earn enough money to buy food and clothesfor both herself and him.Now, on the morning of which I am speaking, she rose very early and wentout to feed her pigs, for rent-day was coming on, and she intended totake one of them, a great, big, fat creature, to the market that veryday, as she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a longway towards paying her rent.And because she thought so, her heart was light, and she hummed a littlesong to herself as she crossed the yard with her bucket on one arm andher baby-boy on the other."
3,"But the song was quickly changed into a cry of despair when she reachedthe pig-stye, for there lay her cherished pig on its back, with its legsin the air and its eyes shut, just as if it were going to breathe itslast breath.""What shall I do? What shall I do?"" cried the poor woman, sitting downon a big stone and clasping her boy to her breast, heedless of the factthat she had dropped her bucket, and that the pig's-meat was runningout, and that the hens were eating it.""First I lost my husband, and now I am going to lose my finest pig. Thepig that I hoped would fetch a deal of money.""Now I must explain to you that the house of Kittlerumpit stood on ahillside, with a great fir wood behind it, and the ground sloping downsteeply in front."
4,"And as the poor young thing, after having a good cry to herself, wasdrying her eyes, she chanced to look down the hill, and who should shesee coming up it but an Old Woman, who looked like a lady born.She was dressed all in green, with a white apron, and she wore a blackvelvet hood on her head, and a steeple-crowned beaver hat over that,something like those, as I have heard tell, that the women wear inWales. She walked very slowly, leaning on a long staff, and she gave abit hirple now and then, as if she were lame.As she drew near, the young widow felt it was becoming to rise andcurtsey to the Gentlewoman, for such she saw her to be."
5,"""Madam,"" she said, with a sob in her voice, ""I bid you welcome to thehouse of Kittlerumpit, although you find its Mistress one of the mostunfortunate women in the world.""""Hout-tout,"" answered the old Lady, in such a harsh voice that the youngwoman started, and grasped her baby tighter in her arms. ""Ye have littleneed to say that. Ye have lost your husband, I grant ye, but there werewaur losses at Shirra-Muir. And now your pig is like to die--I could,maybe, remedy that. But I must first hear how much ye wad gie me if Icured him.""""Anything that your Ladyship's Madam likes to ask,"" replied the widow,too much delighted at having the animal's life saved to think that shewas making rather a rash promise.""Very good,"" said the old Dame, and without wasting any more words shewalked straight into the pig-sty."
6,"She stood and looked at the dying creature for some minutes, rocking toand fro and muttering to herself in words which the widow could notunderstand; at least, she could only understand four of them, and theysounded something like this:    ""Pitter-patter,    Haly water.""Then she put her hand into her pocket and drew out a tiny bottle with aliquid that looked like oil in it. She took the cork out, and droppedone of her long lady-like fingers into it; then she touched the pig onthe snout and on his ears, and on the tip of his curly tail.No sooner had she done so than up the beast jumped, and, with a grunt ofcontentment, ran off to its trough to look for its breakfast."
7,"A joyful woman was the Mistress of Kittlerumpit when she saw it do this,for she felt that her rent was safe; and in her relief and gratitude shewould have kissed the hem of the strange Lady's green gown, if shewould have allowed it, but she would not.""No, no,"" said she, and her voice sounded harsher than ever. ""Let ushave no fine meanderings, but let us stick to our bargain. I have donemy part, and mended the pig; now ye must do yours, and give me what Ilike to ask--your son.""Then the poor widow gave a piteous cry, for she knew now what she hadnot guessed before--that the Green-clad Lady was a Fairy, and a WickedFairy too, else had she not asked such a terrible thing.It was too late now, however, to pray, and beseech, and beg for mercy;the Fairy stood her ground, hard and cruel."
8,"""Ye promised me what I liked to ask, and I have asked your son; and yourson I will have,"" she replied, ""so it is useless making such a din aboutit. But one thing I may tell you, for I know well that the knowledgewill not help you. By the laws of Fairy-land, I cannot take the bairntill the third day after this, and if by that time you have found out myname I cannot take him even then. But ye will not be able to find itout, of that I am certain. So I will call back for the boy in threedays.""And with that she disappeared round the back of the pig-sty, and thepoor mother fell down in a dead faint beside the stone.All that day, and all the next, she did nothing but sit in her kitchenand cry, and hug her baby tighter in her arms; but on the day beforethat on which the Fairy said that she was coming back, she felt as ifshe must get a little breath of fresh air, so she went for a walk in thefir wood behind the house."
9,"Now in this fir wood there was an old quarry hole, in the bottom ofwhich was a bonnie spring well, the water of which was always sweet andpure. The young widow was walking near this quarry hole, when, to herastonishment, she heard the whirr of a spinning-wheel and the sound of avoice lilting a song. At first she could not think where the sound camefrom; then, remembering the quarry, she laid down her child at a treeroot, and crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees tothe edge of the hole and peeped over.She could hardly believe her eyes! For there, far below her, at thebottom of the quarry, beside the spring well, sat the cruel Fairy,dressed in her green frock and tall felt hat, spinning away as fast asshe could at a tiny spinning-wheel.And what should she be singing but--    ""Little kens our guid dame at hame,    Whippety-Stourie is my name."""
10,"The widow woman almost cried aloud for joy, for now she had learned theFairy's secret, and her child was safe. But she dare not, in case thewicked old Dame heard her and threw some other spell over her.So she crept softly back to the place where she had left her child;then, catching him up in her arms, she ran through the wood to herhouse, laughing, and singing, and tossing him in the air in such a stateof delight that, if anyone had met her, they would have been in dangerof thinking that she was mad.Now this young woman had been a merry-hearted maiden, and would havebeen merry-hearted still, if, since her marriage, she had not had somuch trouble that it had made her grow old and sober-minded before hertime; and she began to think what fun it would be to tease the Fairy fora few minutes before she let her know that she had found out her name."
11,"So next day, at the appointed time, she went out with her boy in herarms, and seated herself on the big stone where she had sat before; andwhen she saw the old Dame coming up the hill, she crumpled up her niceclean cap, and screwed up her face, and pretended to be in greatdistress and to be crying bitterly.The Fairy took no notice of this, however, but came close up to her, andsaid, in her harsh, merciless voice, ""Good wife of Kittlerumpit, ye kenthe reason of my coming; give me the bairn.""Then the young mother pretended to be in sorer distress than ever, andfell on her knees before the wicked old woman and begged for mercy."
12,"""Oh, sweet Madam Mistress,"" she cried, ""spare me my bairn, and take, andthou wilt, the pig instead.""""We have no need of bacon where I come from,"" answered the Fairy coldly;""so give me the laddie and let me begone--I have no time to waste inthis wise.""""Oh, dear Lady mine,"" pleaded the Goodwife, ""if thou wilt not have thepig, wilt thou not spare my poor bairn and take me myself?""The Fairy stepped back a little, as if in astonishment. ""Art thou mad,woman,"" she cried contemptuously, ""that thou proposest such a thing? Whoin all the world would care to take a plain-looking, red-eyed, dowdywife like thee with them?"""
13,"Now the young Mistress of Kittlerumpit knew that she was no beauty, andthe knowledge had never vexed her; but something in the Fairy's tonemade her feel so angry that she could contain herself no longer.""In troth, fair Madam, I might have had the wit to know that the like ofme is not fit to tie the shoe-string of the High and Mighty Princess,WHIPPETY-STOURIE!""If there had been a charge of gunpowder buried in the ground, and if ithad suddenly exploded beneath her feet, the Wicked Fairy could not havejumped higher into air.And when she came down again she simply turned round and ran down thebrae, shrieking with rage and disappointment, for all the world, as anold book says, ""like an owl chased by witches."""
