0,Once upon a time there was a man who went by the name of Old Dschang. ,0,70
1,"He lived in the country, near Yangdschou, as a gardener. ",70,127
2,"His neighbor, named Sir We, held an official position in Yangdschou. ",127,196
3,"Sir We had decided that it was time for his daughter to marry, so he sent for a match-maker and commissioned her to find a suitable husband. ",196,337
4,"Old Dschang heard this, and was pleased. ",337,378
5,"He prepared food and drink, entertained the match-maker, and told her to recommend him as a husband. ",378,479
6,But the old match-maker went off scolding. ,479,522
7,The next day he invited her to dinner again and gave her money. ,522,586
8,"Then the old match-maker said: ""You do not know what you wish! ",586,649
9,Why should a gentleman's beautiful daughter condescend to marry a poor old gardener like yourself? ,649,748
10,"Even though you had money to burn, your white hair would not match her black locks. ",748,832
11,"Such a marriage is out of the question!"" ",832,873
12,"But Old Dschang did not cease to entreat her: ""Make an attempt, just one attempt, to mention me! ",873,970
13,"If they will not listen to you, then I must resign myself to my fate!"" ",970,1041
14,"The old match-maker had taken his money, so she could not well refuse, and though she feared being scolded, she mentioned him to Sir We. ",1041,1178
15,He grew angry and wanted to throw her out of the house. ,1178,1234
16,"""I knew you would not thank me,"" said she, ""but the old man urged it so that I could not refuse to mention his intention."" ",1234,1357
17,"""Tell the old man that if this very day he brings me two white jade-stones, and four hundred ounces of yellow gold, then I will give him my daughter's hand in marriage."" ",1357,1527
18,"But he only wished to mock the old man's folly, for he knew that the latter could not give him anything of the kind. ",1527,1644
19,The match-maker went to Old Dschang and delivered the message. ,1644,1707
20,And he made no objection; ,1707,1733
21, but at once brought the exact quantity of gold and jewels to Sir We's house. ,1732,1810
22,"The latter was very much frightened and when his wife heard of it, she began to weep and wail loudly. ",1810,1912
23,"But the girl encouraged her mother: ""My father has given his word now and cannot break it. ",1912,2003
24,"I will know how to bear my fate."" ",2003,2037
25,So Sir We's daughter was married to Old Dschang. ,2037,2086
26,But even after the wedding the latter did not give up his work as a gardener. ,2086,2164
27,"He spaded the field and sold vegetables as usual, and his wife had to fetch water and build the kitchen fire herself. ",2164,2282
28,"But she did her work without false shame and, though her relatives reproached her, she continued to do so. ",2282,2389
29,"Once an aristocratic relative visited Sir We and said: ""If you had really been poor, were there not enough young gentlemen in the neighborhood for your daughter? ",2389,2551
30,Why did you have to marry her to such a wrinkled old gardener? ,2551,2614
31,"Now that you have thrown her away, so to speak, it would be better if both of them left this part of the country."" ",2614,2729
32,Then Sir We prepared a banquet and invited his daughter and Old Dschang to visit him. ,2729,2815
33,When they had had sufficient to eat and drink he allowed them to get an inkling of what was in his mind. ,2815,2920
34,"Said Old Dschang: ""I have only remained here because I thought you would long for your daughter. ",2920,3017
35,"But since you are tired of us, I will be glad to go. ",3017,3070
36,"I have a little country house back in the hills, and we will set out for it early to-morrow morning."" ",3070,3172
37,"The following morning, at break of dawn, Old Dschang came with his wife to say farewell. ",3172,3261
38,"Sir We said: ""Should we long to see you at some later time, my son can make inquiries."" ",3261,3349
39,Old Dschang placed his wife on a donkey and gave her a straw hat to wear. ,3349,3423
40,He himself took his staff and walked after. ,3423,3467
41,A few years passed without any news from either of them. ,3467,3524
42,Then Sir We and his wife felt quite a longing to see their daughter and sent their son to make inquiries. ,3524,3630
43,When the latter got back in the hills he met a plow-boy who was plowing with two yellow steers. ,3630,3726
44,"He asked him: ""Where is Old Dschang's country house?"" ",3726,3780
45,"The plow-boy left the plow in the harrow, bowed and answered: ""You have been a long time coming, sir! ",3780,3882
46,"The village is not far from here: I will show you the way."" ",3882,3942
47,They crossed a hill. ,3942,3963
48,"At the foot of the hill flowed a brook, and when they had crossed the brook they had to climb another hill. ",3963,4071
49,Gradually the landscape changed. ,4071,4104
50,"From the top of the hill could be seen a valley, level in the middle, surrounded by abrupt crags and shaded by green trees, among which houses and towers peeped forth. ",4104,4272
51,This was the country house of Old Dschang. ,4272,4315
52,"Before the village flowed a deep brook full of clear, blue water. ",4315,4381
53,They passed over a stone bridge and reached the gate. ,4381,4435
54,"Here flowers and trees grew in luxurious profusion, and peacocks and cranes flew about. ",4435,4523
55,From the distance could be heard the sound of flutes and of stringed instruments. ,4523,4605
56,Crystal-clear tones rose to the clouds. ,4605,4645
57,A messenger in a purple robe received the guest at the gate and led him into a hall of surpassing splendor. ,4645,4753
58,"Strange fragrances filled the air, and there was a ringing of little bells of pearl. ",4753,4838
59,"Two maid-servants came forth to greet him, followed by two rows of beautiful girls in a long processional. ",4838,4945
60,"After them a man in a flowing turban, clad in scarlet silk, with red slippers, came floating along. ",4945,5045
61,The guest saluted him. ,5045,5068
62,"He was serious and dignified, and at the same time seemed youthfully fresh. ",5068,5144
63,"At first We's son did not recognize him, but when he looked more closely, why it was Old Dschang! ",5144,5242
64,"The latter said with a smile: ""I am pleased that the long road to travel has not prevented your coming. ",5242,5346
65,Your sister is just combing her hair. ,5346,5384
66,"She will welcome you in a moment."" ",5384,5419
67,Then he had him sit down and drink tea. ,5419,5459
68,"After a short time a maid-servant came and led him to the inner rooms, to his sister. ",5459,5545
69,"The beams of her room were of sandalwood, the doors of tortoise-shell and the windows inlaid with blue jade; ",5545,5654
70, her curtains were formed of strings of pearls and the steps leading into the room of green nephrite. ,5653,5755
71,"His sister was magnificently gowned, and far more beautiful than before. ",5755,5828
72,"She asked him carelessly how he was getting along, and what her parents were doing; ",5828,5912
73, but was not very cordial. ,5911,5938
74,After a splendid meal she had an apartment prepared for him. ,5938,5999
75,"""My sister wishes to make an excursion to the Mountain of the Fairies,"" said Old Dschang to him. ",5999,6096
76,"""We will be back about sunset, and you can rest until we return."" ",6096,6162
77,"Then many-colored clouds rose in the courtyard, and dulcet music sounded on the air. ",6162,6247
78,"Old Dschang mounted a dragon, while his wife and sister rode on phenixes and their attendants on cranes. ",6247,6352
79,So they rose into the air and disappeared in an easterly direction. ,6352,6420
80,They did not return until after sunset. ,6420,6460
81,"Old Dschang and his wife then said to him: ""This is an abode of the blessed. ",6460,6537
82,You cannot remain here overlong. ,6537,6570
83,"To-morrow we will escort you back."" ",6570,6606
84,"On the following day, when taking leave, Old Dschang gave him eighty ounces of gold and an old straw hat. ",6606,6712
85,"""Should you need money,"" said he, ""you can go to Yangdschou and inquire in the northern suburb for old Wang's drug-shop. ",6712,6833
86,There you can collect ten million pieces of copper. ,6833,6885
87,"This hat is the order for them."" ",6885,6918
88,Then he ordered his plow-boy to take him home again. ,6918,6971
89,"Quite a few of the folks at home, to whom he described his adventures, thought that Old Dschang must be a holy man, while others regarded the whole thing a magic vision. ",6971,7141
90,After five or six years Sir We's money came to an end. ,7141,7196
91,So his son took the straw hat to Yangdschou and there asked for old Wang. ,7196,7270
92,"The latter just happened to be standing in his drug-shop, mixing herbs. ",7270,7342
93,"When the son explained his errand he said: ""The money is ready. ",7342,7406
94,"But is your hat genuine?"" ",7406,7432
95,And he took the hat and examined it. ,7432,7469
96,"A young girl came from an inner room and said: ""I wove the hat for Old Dschang myself. ",7469,7556
97,"There must be a red thread in it."" ",7556,7591
98,"And sure enough, there was. ",7591,7619
99,"Then old Wang gave young We the ten million pieces of copper, and the latter now believed that Old Dschang was really a saint. ",7619,7746
100,So he once more went over the hills to look for him. ,7746,7799
101,"He asked the forest-keepers, but they could tell him naught. ",7799,7860
102,"Sadly he retraced his steps and decided to inquire of old Wang, but he had also disappeared. ",7860,7953
103,"When several years had passed he once more came to Yangdschou, and was walking in the meadow before the city gate. ",7953,8068
104,There he met Old Dschang's plow-boy. ,8068,8105
105,"The latter cried out: ""How are you? ",8105,8141
106,"How are you?"" ",8141,8155
107,"and drew out ten pounds of gold, which he gave to him, saying: ""My mistress told me to give you this. ",8155,8257
108,"My master is this very moment drinking tea with old Wang in the inn."" ",8257,8327
109,"Young We followed the plow-boy, intending to greet his brother-in-law. ",8327,8398
110,But when he reached the inn there was no one in sight. ,8398,8453
111,And when he turned around the plow-boy had disappeared as well. ,8453,8517
112,And since that time no one ever heard from Old Dschang again.,8517,8579
